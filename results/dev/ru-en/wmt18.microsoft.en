Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law imposing administrative responsibility for violation of the term and order of payment of goods (works, services) in the implementation of purchases for state and municipal needs.
This law is designed to address the very acute problem of customers' defaults in public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not get paid under already executed state and municipal contracts, was widespread.
At the same time, the Russian president instructed the Russian Prosecutor General's Office to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who concluded contracts not backed by financing, tried to evade the obligations of payment and included in the contracts illegal conditions.
The problem was systemic in general in the country.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the Prosecutor's Office has made 9.7 thousand submissions, as a result of their consideration, 4,500 officials have been brought to disciplinary responsibility, 533 to the administrative ones, 75 materials have been submitted to the investigative bodies for organizing procedural checks, 46 of them have been prosecuted.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs amounting to more than 66 billion rubles was repaid.
And these huge sums were not accumulated as a result of non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in paying services to entrepreneurs for much more modest sums led to fabulous debts.
Here's a typical case.
The head of a small company won a competition to provide services for social transportation for several million rubles.
The man invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled the obligations, but did not receive the money in time.
The result is a growing financial com of debts on salaries, taxes, loans, which would lead to bankruptcy, if the entrepreneur did not apply for help to the prosecutor's office.
Now in a number of regions the problem has been leveled as much as possible.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, identified by prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical levels, the prosecutor's office operates in a manual anti-crisis management regime.
The Attorney-General personally holds field meetings with local authorities, where all violations uncovered by prosecutors are dealt with and measures to address them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already taken place in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of Federal Law No. 189-Fz "On amending the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in terms of establishing the administrative responsibility of customer officials for violation of the term and order of payment of goods (works, services) in the implementation of purchases for the provision of state and municipal needs" will be able to improve the payment of public customers.
The draft law was developed by the Russian Ministry of Economic Development on the initiative of the Prosecutor General's Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences with an article, which provides for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 rubles for violation of the term and payment of goods, works and services in state and municipal procurements.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative novels in practice.
Civil rights group announces travel warning in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The National Association for the Advancement of Colored Travel, valid until August 28, 2017, encourages African-American travelers, visitors and citizens of Missouri to be particularly careful and to exercise increased caution when traveling across the state in response to a number of controversial racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and are brought here."
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the group's recent law in Missouri made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, and that state law enforcement disproportionately choose minorities as their targets, according to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
"People are being violated by human rights.
They are stopped on the roads because of their skin color, they are beaten and killed," Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People of Missouri, told the Kansas City Star newspaper.
"We hear complaints more often than ever before."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization to the U.S. state.
The group cited incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gasoline during a state trip, and Missouri State Police arrested him without charge of a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office, which found that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than whites.
"The purpose of the warning is to keep people informed of the situation and to warn their family and friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People should be prepared in one way or another, whether they take the money with them for bail or tell their relatives that they are traveling across the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI's Hate Crime Report Program, There were 100 hate crimes recorded in Missouri in 2015, making the state the 16th largest state in the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that will make it more difficult to bring a case against a legal entity for housing or labor discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings to travelers in Texas and Arizona after those states passed new immigration control laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU said should have increased the number of racially motivated background checks.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two killed in shooting at police patrol in Egypt
Unidentified gunmen fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reported, citing Egypt's Interior Ministry.
Two people, including one policeman, were killed and three were wounded in the exchange of fire.
All the injured were taken to hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the intruders was detained, the second managed to escape.
Rosturism supports the law on the abolition of free luggage for non-refundable tickets
The head of Rosturism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with RBC TV channel that he is "positive" about the adoption of the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable tickets.
"We need to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage," he said (quoted by TASS).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that despite the fears of citizens, there is no need to pay for the transport of outerwear and mobile phone in hand luggage.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and declare it, to say that it is to outer clothing, to an umbrella, to a mobile phone, to an iPad or even some computer will have no relation," - said the head of Rosturism.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the rule on free baggage for non-refundable flights.
It is a question that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of luggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate pollution of Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the protection of Baikal that in recent years large areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to determine the sources of funding, plans and executors to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin also ordered a full-fledged reclamation of the contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to deal with the objects that continue to work here, the treatment plants of most of them are worn out," RIA Novosti quoted the president as saying.
He added that the Russian Prosecutor General's Office should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, there are problems in the lake area related to the emergence of natural landfills and a number of environmental violations by the organizers of the rest.
"I want to emphasize this: not everything should be checked, there is also a measure you need to know, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he said.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of facilities subject to environmental supervision.
Recall, on June 15, Vladimir Putin during a direct line stated the need to change the law to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural areas of the special protection regime.
He was informed about the problems with economic activity by the residents of Olkhon Island, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the water protection zone of Baikal, but the buryatia government reminded that such a change is not enough, as the restrictions are associated with a number of regulations.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by changing the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
A new temple will appear in Ugra
In the village of Sosva, members of the indigenous small peoples of the North, Rakhtynya, together with the residents of the Berezovsky district, take part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location - the river bank, the temple will be clearly visible from afar, so it will serve as a travel beacon for fishermen.
According to the community, the construction work will be completed this year, now the domes have been installed, and church bells are available.
The Navy's Nesima REB provided transportation support.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, as it is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosva, fishing gives settlers jobs and feeds them.
Local residents are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write in school essays about it as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why is Singapore complying with the law?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an outdoor diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, butts neatly stored in an iron box picked up from the office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - to her a hundred meters - and throws the bulls there.
The fine for trash in a public place is 500 local dollars, Chang reports.
You know, I've just developed a reflex since childhood: you can't throw a candy fan on the pavement, you'll be fined instantly.
And now there are video cameras everywhere.
And indeed - the sidewalks of Singapore in the center of the city are clean, as if in a museum.
Chang says that three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the boy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
what?!
Imagine.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on the buttocks and spent a week in prison.
In general, corporal punishment is not uncommon.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly strict laws, the AIF columnist was versed in place.
No one here thinks to abolish the death penalty, - explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long been concerned about the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this issue.
If a person smuggles a large consignment of drugs or sells them - he is put on the gallows.
A 22-year-old Australian national was detained at Changi Airport in 2002 after carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
The Australian prime minister defended him, threatening sanctions, international human rights activists and even the pope.
However, the guy was eventually hanged anyway.
After that, drug couriers of our country diligently go around the side.
The point is this: Singapore has a duty to comply with ALL, not just modest and poor people.
It does not matter who you are - a millionaire, deputy prime minister, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
The option in this case is one: if you find half a kilo of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a bunch of warnings, you just wonder - how many bans in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly on the prescription (!) of the doctor.
The tourist on arrival gum will not be taken away, but it is necessary to glue "rubber" in the subway, stick a fine of 1,000 local dollars.
In four days I met two people with white signs around my neck: "I littered."
For thrown past the urn butt in addition to the fine is often sentenced to "link to the janitors": a week to clean parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles pays "criminal" who forgot to wash away the water in the public toilet, and when trying to cope with a small need in the elevator of an apartment building triggered a special detector - the doors are blocked and sent a signal to the police.
Among the most exotic laws - bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of the house (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
To avoid fires, smokers should not carry lighters in the subway, otherwise fined 5,000 Singapore dollars.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how hard you try, you will break something.
This is not the case," Mohammad Kabir-Kajariya, the owner of a local travel agency, tries to dissuade me.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone being attracted to them for violating them.
Why do they persist?
So that citizens do not relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
For example, if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, everyone will be punished by chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge sum, the offender will receive blows with sticks on the "back part", and the seller will also be kicked out and put in jail.
It is thanks to such strict laws that offences in Singapore are very rare.
Is it justified?
Back in the seventies, we were in chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, got drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for the year everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having drunk a portion of whiskey, knows: if they stop, the policeman will not let go for a bribe, impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and for years will be sent to prison.
For many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - a guest from the United States horrified the general wealth of residents, "frighteningly clean airport" and "cultured nature."
They say that such things are unnatural, look artificial, and so in principle should not be.
The first days in Singapore and surely afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, you catch up if you went to the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the "Little India" area, and suddenly - "breaking the template": at the bus stop lying plastic cups.
"What's that?" you wonder.
And that's it, - the Singaporeans grin.
Things do happen.
Not every such "crime" will be caught on the spot, but you should know: if you are calculated, do not smear - because you broke the law.
More often than not, this is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras from the hands of tourists.
The center of Paris is full of dirty bums and beggars.
On our streets, too, not everyone tries to throw garbage in the urns.
Singapore, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth.
You'll think about it.
Such is human nature: remember, and in Russia no one buckled up behind the wheel until they began to fine.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with laws.
And we must think that in Russia people would also be happy with clean streets, lack of garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
Here are corporal punishments - thank you, no.
Otherwise, The laws of Singapore are at least worth a look at them.
Nothing sacred?
Now the Trump White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The surest sign of regime change is when he begins to fight the statues.
Americans understand this no worse than everyone else - hence the deliberate theatrical demolition of a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration's key ideologues, no doubt knew what he was doing when he blew a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a bitter dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try on the statue itself.
The hordes of pleasure boat owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried to do so.
But he tried to make sense of it, and especially the meaning that was attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when Emma Lazarus's poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled at Acosta: "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller correctly laid out the facts, but as he himself said, it's not really about the story.
It's about the current sound of the startling words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds, dreaming to breathe freely, / The unfortunate dregs of your abundant shores."
Never before have "unfortunate garbage" been so visible on our screens.
Miller wasn't involved in literature - he made it clear that in Trump's America, these people aren't expected.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it's really a debate about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to put her words on the plinth of the statue after her death - were very well aware that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: The Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of the poem and the image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though change it back.
The vociferous Rush Limbaugh, the sort of John the Baptist who heralded Trump's coming, in 2010 reasoned that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neoconservative who carries the flames of America lying in the darkness of the world: "Freedom goes forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to illuminate the path to the United States."
Against the habit of Limbaugh here really got to the point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
Lazarus's great creative achievement was to see her as seen by the exhausted, unhappy but hopeful people on the decks of the ships after a long and often hard voyage.
It means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who are seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, that's not the kind of prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to accept.
Their torch is needed not to illuminate the path, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake praises Scottish team-england squad.
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scots in the Great Britain team
Neil Blake, director of the UK Athletics Federation, said the 16-man Scottish squad for the World Cup would make a "significant contribution to the team's performance."
A record number of Scottish track and field athletes have been selected for the 2017 London Championships starting on Friday.
Blake believes there is something special about Scotland and the UK Athletics Federation should take that into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand and we'll support it as long as they have potential," Blake said.
'I've spoken to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has to do with what they've done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks they have to work with what they have done.
British Athletics Federation: What they've done, we've got to work with.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why the circumstances are so, but it's absolutely brilliant."
Some of Scotland's track and field athletes are competing for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m; and Eilidh Doyle's team chose its captain.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake said.
"Many track and field athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and where they live or train, have left this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings Eilidh put into it were wonderful."
The winner of the commonwealth championship silver medal, who will run the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says the 16 Scots in the British team are "unbelievable."
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Ahead is Laura Muir, who specialises in middle-distance running and has broken five British and two European records last year.
She will run 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will compete in the 1500m race, is another Scot to look out for: he has a successful season behind him, which has been won by the British national team and the Annual Competition.
Doyle recalls his first World Cup, when the only Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says that she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots not only entered the national team, but in some cases will qualify for medals and fight for the final.
"The captain of the national team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but to know that your teammates voted for you and you were chosen is a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course I am very proud of all the Scots who have joined the national team.
It shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all accomplished athletes who will strive to get on the podium.
What about my captain's speech?
Yes, I think she was pretty good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we will be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to enter his arena and take part in the competition, and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful."
Facebook critics: Don't run for public office if you're not willing to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
Americans loved George Washington, but that didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism of him, of course, irritated.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because as far back as 1783, Washington said, "you can take away the freedom of speech and we, deaf and dumb, will lead like sheep to the slaughterhouse."
Now I'm going to turn to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subordinates called the lawsuit insignificant, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well and what."
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it's also important.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He's a surprisingly popular Republican governor in the Democratic primary state.
He is in second place in the approval rating among 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a staunch reactionary.
He has shown a firm hand in the management of the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also deftly uses Facebook as a primary way to connect with his constituents and with jokes showing off his bald post-chemotherapy head on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is billed as an official public forum and run by administration officials with taxpayer money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with The Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Chas defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was simply their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and haters, angry on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people that Hogan blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor who appeals to their elected leaders.
All of them say that their comments were respectful, informative and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing that Hogan was Catholic.
Lakshmi's attorney, Sarma Raman of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hate but asked about the hate crimes.
"I have made a polite comment that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of the Post article.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it's a so-called twist, instead of admitting to having to deal with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What the governor's subordinates call a "concentrated spam attack", others would probably call "active life position."
In the era of Facebook, it's easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
It's a much less dusty job than it used to be, when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical editorials, or arresting and shutting the mouths of protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening now, only in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, pivotal decisions on the topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James K. Casherys of Alexandria, the chairman of the Loudon County Supervisory Board violated the First Amendment by locking a voter on his Facecbook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Gov. Matt Bavin sued the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's time, the era of affordable postal spending has taken about the same upheaval as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters greatly destroyed its authority.
And even then, Washington dealt with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms Yurikola, Valerias, Belizerius and Porousius wrote letters to newspapers ridiculing Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the online project "George Washington Documents", his office was inundated with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very core of our state.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a home comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty is hoping for a home-based comfort for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian host the 25th Scottish Open golf tournament for senior athletes.
The Northern Ireland native, who led the club's Archerfield Links and moved towards the final round last year before losing to Paul Ils, has been tacked on to a new position and is serving as a tournament representative on behalf of the club's founder and director Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance club build and we've seen it come to success with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this field at its best moment, it is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job making this place.
He is an ardent supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It's a great demonstration for this field."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to the opportunity to defend the title for the first time, despite the fact that during his 32-year career he won both the European tournament and the European Challenge Tour.
"It's a really special feeling," the Southport player said.
"I couldn't try to win the Extremadura Open again because he was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
To return to this corner of the world is magical.
It's a great place to play golf.
Memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife Sharon it was a very special experience to win last year.
It was a really special time and we will always remember him."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Athlete Tournament after he turned 50 earlier this year, is back in action.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always a little bit more important," Helensboro orr resident said.
"You want to perform well, but you feel it's an extra burden."
I enjoyed playing again and I showed good golf.
I'm happy with how it works so far."
Former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior sports majors Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty will join the trio.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs 5 pounds per hour if there is one person in the car, and 10 pounds if the person is two or more.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
The original tunnels above the highways, capable of absorbing carbon monoxide emitted by cars, are already being tested on UK roads.
According to Autocar, the country's transport agency reported positive results of tests of a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The 6-meter-high tunnel is built from some of the latest polymeric materials that can absorb the harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce traffic flow on the roads, expand the use of commercial transport on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is caused by transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Moscow City Court changed the punishment of disabled Mamayev to a fine
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment of the disabled Anton Mamayev, who was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to replace the term with a suspended sentence, explaining its request by saying that Mamayev's disease "prevents him from being in prison."
Anton Mamayev, 28, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, serving his sentence in a general regime colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces soldier.
On July 19, the court released the man from custody at an exit hearing in the pre-trial detention center.
Poverty and death in Indonesian "golden land"
While cooking lunch, Bardin Degai does not use the stove.
She even uses pot rarely.
In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually simply places a sweet potato, which is called "note", right in the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken out and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degay sits on the earthen floor - she doesn't have furniture - and it is here that she does her chores, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The restroom serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one dares to walk around the village after five in the evening," she says.
It is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote in public raising their hands in front of occupying troops.
The existing pro-independence movement from the Netherlands quickly drew its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders from being allowed.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; The road here includes an hour-and-a-half flight from Jayapura, the provincial capital, to Nabir, and then a five-hour shaking on a hired car.
There is no public transport here.
The city of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; roofed corrugated steel is painted with rust in a variety of reddish shades.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners got here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamae.
There were other changes.
"It was unusual for us to wear these clothes," Degay says, pointing to his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a high-altitude province about the size of New Jersey, home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua boasts forest reserves estimated at $78 billion.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful armed forces maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to a New York Times investigation in 2005, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to an officer.
The demands for greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this gold mine and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in indigenous people in the highlands of Papua in the seventies can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything," a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane Diocese, contains evidence of atrocities committed the previous year, such as non-trial executions, torture - especially frequent, according to another report, rape and electric shock - and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because there are incidents every week," said Andreas Harsono, a research researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The nuts dragged on as Papua's resources attracted an influx of migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5-million-strong population is 83 percent Christian, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese shops, "varungs", sell fried chicken and a mixture of vegetables "godo-gado" served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to withstand the competition.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the natives of Papua," explains Abet Jou, a twenty-four-year-old paniai native who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, because of work.
"Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua - the mother-mother (women) of Papua - have lost their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokomi, vowed to tackle inequality and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But in Papua almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokoie, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for justice," says You.
In fact, just two months after Jokoi Paniai's October inauguration, he experienced a tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols by a fire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the darkness.
Terrified children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers a short time later.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk were chasing children and beating them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Eimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to a nearby government election commission building, and the next day the situation escalated.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of a local police station and a military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed the White, a dance of the Papuan mee pago tribe: they ran in circles and depicted bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation was tense, the soldiers were ordered by internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," as stated in the official document seen by TIME correspondents, but which was not published in local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremiah Koyame, head of the Kego Coto district in Enorotali, felt the danger was approaching and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned, I was suddenly hit in the left wrist by a bullet," he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly colored wooden house.
Koyame still does not know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the side of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots," he adds.
A local resident, AlfieS Jouw, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Johannes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told TIME.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
General Jotje Mende, a senior inspector of Papua police, told reporters that his officers were merely "protecting" their base because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pujo Sulistyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were wounded.
News of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokoi delivered an impassioned speech in Jayapur in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the historic abuse of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister for Security Viranto said he would establish a non-judicial organization to end historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or early zeros.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be passed," he said.
Viranto then retracted his remarks, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he had no plans to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be decided through the courts."
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the bloody vote for East Timor's independence in 1999, said 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the Victims of Paniai met with grim incredulity.
"I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but there's been no change at all," says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid I'll be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Jacobus also suggested that the people of Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came for me," he said.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot and killed villagers in the neighbouring Paniai district of Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 others, including children, were killed and 17 others, including children, were killed in a clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help take an unconscious man to hospital.
A man, 24-year-old Ravianus Dow, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company-owned construction site.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the officers, who responded with warning shots.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) began shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retribution," Domingue Badia, 20, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being hurriedly delivered, told TIME.
"I hid at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account and the mobile police brigade withdrawn from the region.
Paniyai has always been a sore spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development is caused by discontent of the tribes of mee, moni, tributes and damal, scattered throughout the territory of the green-covered central highland districts of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), an insurgent army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by staging sporadic attacks and kidnapping attacks on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of OPM's top executives come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response to the recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and detained by the military in Paniai on the pretext of "protecting national independence".
Some never came back.
Among the population of Papua Paniai is considered a "sad, forgotten place."
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is equally inaccessible.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly a note, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually save most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten tubers of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic disparity between indigenous Papuans and new migrants, who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabir airport, has increased.
Few existing vacancies usually go to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuans rarely have the money or the skills they need to run their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is no work, no money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain harsh.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for "insufficient coordination with the relevant organizations" despite being given rare permits to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy asia director at Human Rights Watch, promises made during Jokoi's election campaign to lift restrictions on media work to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua face new dangers: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramanata Nasir shrugged off the group's statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights abuses."
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights Kiis Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the locals broke their silence, praying, "We want freedom," according to the source, who was also present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokoi again.
"Jokomi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting," said Gobai, chairman of the tribe's council.
He wants Jokoi to know that the people of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of the threat posed by the greedy army, are mired in poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote for Jokoi a debt he has to pay.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of defiance: the body of one of the victims was buried on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military plot.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"They killed a member of our family," Jacobus says, without raising his head.
"What else were we going to do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai's Torch skyscraper for second time
A fire engulfed one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to hurriedly leave a 337-metre-high 337-metre high.
This is the second fire that has swept through the high-rise building - which is coincidentally called the Torch - in two years.
Evacuations were carried out in the building, no casualties were reported and there was no immediate news of the cause of the fire.
"We were asleep and woke up from the fire alarms and screaming people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor," a resident of the skyscraper, who gave his as george, told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense Authority, fire crews extinguished the blaze at about 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The Government said it was working to provide asylum to the victims.
The incident could bring the safety of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world back to the agenda.
An investigation by the Torch administration after a fire there in 2015 revealed that the cladding was the hardest hit - external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the UNITED Kingdom, police said they believed the insulation system and cladding panels at the Grenfell Tower building in London could have accelerated the spread of the fire there in June, which killed about 80 people.
The growth of tourist traffic in Ida Virumaa in June was minimal
According to the data, which the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee received in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists used the services of hotels in the Northeast, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased and foreign tourists increased.
Thus, foreign tourist traffic increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7,994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
The number of Russian tourists increased most markedly in the region - by 8.9% or by 318 people compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, 3,885 guests from Russia stayed overnight at Ida-Virumaa hotels.
Andrei Malakhov made it clear to fans who is to blame for his departure
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram who is to blame for his departure from the "First" channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today he posted a fragment of the article of the newspaper Vedomosti for August 1.
Photo Malakhov signed the tag "boss of the milkman."
An article on how to prevent the employee from "burning out" and paying attention to his condition.
If we recall the numerous reports that the presenter could not find common ground with the newly arrived producer, who decided to reformat "Let them speak", it becomes clear that he so transparently hinted, writes "KP".
As reported, TV presenter Andrei Malakhov is currently on vacation and did not sign an application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation with dismissal may become clearer in the coming days.
Five soldiers killed in car bombing in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, RIA Novosti reported.
According to the police, a car bomb exploded near a military checkpoint in Girishk county the previous evening.
We know about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new emergency occurred in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange point.
The exchange of fire between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver filmed the shark that bit his camera
Diver and explorer Greg Skomal captured the video of a shark that bit his GoPro action camera.
The video was posted on Facebook by a unit of the U.S. Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, of which The Comual is an employee.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeastern United States, Necn reports.
A man during a snorkeling tried to film the shark on camera, which he held on a special stick.
Noticing the man, the animal, which was more than three meters long, swam up to him.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Thecomal explained that the predator did this to determine if the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily have destroyed the device.
He also noted that such behavior of the sea animal turned out to be a novelty for scientists.
The reason for the mass brawl in the Ural military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Yelan Training Centre, where the mass brawl took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this massacre have already become known.
According to Mash, who appeared on the VKontakte page, the contractors of the Ural military unit number 31612 fought violently because of an unfiltered bed.
It all started with the fact that a private named Sayan defiantly ignored the officer's order to fill up the stuck sheet.
The soldier from the sixth company sided with the officer.
Sayana supported the first company.
For half an hour 140 young guys smashed beds and sinks in the barracks, broke the glass.
More than ten people were injured in the mass brawl.
The CVO denied the information about the stabbing.
The study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the U.S. carry prohibited items on a plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items in their luggage through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration's security checkpoints, including at least 6 percent boarding a plane without incident, carrying prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 percent reported that they later discovered they were carrying firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The study, conducted by charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., which reached more than 1,000 people, also found that younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to deliberately trying to fly with something that is forbidden by ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Consciously, food and water are often carried by ATB employees.
More than 3 per cent admitted to having deliberately carried sharp objects through the search, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted to knowingly carrying banned drugs on the plane.
The company said it was looking into passengers across the country to find out how many of them accidentally smuggled through airport security, and how many did so deliberately.
It is quite expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously - carry contraband through the inspection of those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the rules of ATB are quite complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and in what quantity.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what ATB selects are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB might be considered forbidden to carry a book.
Fluids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA chief Pruitt abandons intention to delay implementation of Obama's emissions reduction rules
A day after a lawsuit by 15 states, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to delay obama-made regulations designed to reduce emissions of air pollutants that lead to smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by saying that his agency now listens more to the needs of individual state environmental regulators than under previous administrations.
He made no mention of a lawsuit against his previous position filed in federal appeals court.
The dispute revolved around the October 1 deadline by which states must meet the 2015 ozone-level standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "inconsistencies with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed by President Trump, has long been known as a consistent opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
Since moving to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of regulations opposed by the chemical or gas and gas industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of course is another legal defeat of Pruitt's policy of reversing the old standards.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA chief overstepped his authority in trying to delay the Obama administration's implementation of a rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that by abruptly changing course on ozone standards, he simply complied with the EPA's responsibility to cooperate with states in a comprehensive process for timely enforcement of the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet schedule, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others to discuss the timing of the settlement," said Pruitt, who has filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our charter and the power it gives us."
However, the EPA said in a statement that Pruitt may at some point re-use his "powers to delay and other data by law" to make sure the rules "jcyjdfys are on a clear course and on all available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of ozone regulations.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on the issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
"The EPA's change of course - following our lawsuits - is an important victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that covers their cities," Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C., joined the lawsuit.
Ozone at ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machinery, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources react to the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health advocates and environmentalists welcomed Pruitt's sudden change of course.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the person tasked with protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the Trump administration's ideological campaign while protecting those who pollute the air and their special interests."
IAAF Congress extends suspension of All-Russia Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (VFLA).
Thus, the Congress supported the IAAF's board for the restoration of vfla, which released a report on Monday, which recommended that the suspension be upheld.
166 people voted in favor of the extension of the suspension, 21 against, TASS reports.
The IAAF board's report said the VFLA had made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the board to restore membership, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the VFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian track and field athletes were forced to compete under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF Championship.
VflA was suspended indefinitely by the IAAF in 2015.
Then the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was published, which said about numerous violations of WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.
Read more about the IAAF board's latest report in the article "The IAAF has extended sanctions against VFLA."
A humiliating defeat
As part of the third round of the Fonbet Championship of Russia among the PFL teams, the New Moscow Chemist played an away match against Kaluga FC.
A little more than 10 days ago, the opponents played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
Chemist did not concede anything to the opponent, but the second relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After the recent 0-3 defeat by Kalugan, many predicted an easy victory for the hosts.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the New Moscowers forced to reckon with themselves and acted from the defense, but from a position of strength.
In the first half, the Kalugans created more and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was played by Alexei Sirotin, who several times repelled dangerous blows and his actions gave the partners confidence.
Unfortunately, in attack "Chemik" lacked effort and luck to stymie the defense of Kaluga and score the first goal on the road.
After the break, the game began to take place on the counter courses.
The New Moscowers played more actively in the attack.
The alarm bells for our team were mistakes in defense, which allowed the Kalugans to create a number of sharp moments.
10 minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemist intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of Kalugan played a role - they more competently and coolly held the ending, waiting for his moment to take the goal.
After a dangerous attack, Chemist moved the ball to the corner, the pitch of which the hosts without resistance sent into the goal.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting "Chemik" demonstrated a good game, but suffered an offensive defeat.
Ahead of our team is waiting for another departure - on August 11 at 19 o'clock in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named After Eduard Streltsov New Moscow will fight with the favorite group "Center" FC "Ararat", which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmaylov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexey Rebko.
Come to support Chemist!
The place and time of the meeting of the New Moscow residents is 18 hours 30 minutes near the magnolia store (Eastern, 2, Corp.

According to published transcripts of phone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico about paying for border wall
The Washington Post published transcripts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned border wall.
The U.S. president scolded him for speaking out publicly against the wall and, according to leaked information, told him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
A transcript of his first phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a heated altercation.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US should accept refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous," "disgusting" and "dumb," and insisted that because of the agreement signed by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot because he intended to stop resettling refugees in the US.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation of the day."
Bodies of tourists killed in Abkhazia sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane belonging to the Russian airline, which has the bodies of Russian women killed in Abkhazia, took off at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS reports.
At the site of the final destination, the board will be met by the staff of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city's mayor's office, Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamyr Akhba told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic said that all expenses related to the delivery of bodies back to Russia, took over the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay compensation to the families of the victims in the amount of 500,000 rubles.
According to Ahba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed readiness to pay relatives of tourists killed in the explosions to fly and live in the republic, but relatives sent only proxies to the republic on the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, two explosions occurred in the village of Primorsky Gudauta district in the warehouse of missile and artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic, after which large-caliber shells and other munitions were detonated.
As a result, the warehouse was ignited, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of projectiles of various modifications.
As a result of the emergency, two Russian citizens died - Elena Polyakova, born in 1970 and Elena Timofeeva, born in 1962, who were on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide spring.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were taken to medical facilities of the republic with injuries of varying severity.
Currently, seven people remain in the hospital, the rest are discharged.
A grand jury will examine Russian influence on the U.S. election
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington to examine Russia's influence in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be examined by the special prosecutor and will decide whether there are enough of them to bring charges.
The grand jury's convening gives Mueller additional powers to gather testimony.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
Mueller himself has previously promised to verify the details of the June 2016 meeting.
They've already been studied by the FBI.
In late July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. has previously said that from a meeting with Veselnitskaya, he was waiting for a compromise on the headquarters of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but no revealing documents were presented, and it was ultimately about adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.'s statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which would do any father.
Penza's deputy mayor detained at work
Deputy head of the Penza administration Irina Shirshina was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at her workplace, RIA Novosti reported.
There have been no official reports from law enforcement agencies on this issue, but the press service of the SC assured that they will follow soon.
Penza City Hall has not yet commented on the incident.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of Penza's administration.
She has overseen urban planning and land relations, having held the position since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as the head of the department of the State Housing Inspectorate for the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina brings up three minor children, it is noteworthy that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no cosmodrome or launch vehicle in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person who visited space.
Unlike Soviet-era monuments, which are being demolished in some countries, Gagarin monuments, on the contrary, "walk on the planet."
In 2012, the monument was installed in The American City of Houston near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument on the grounds of the Royal Observatory was erected to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first space flight.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfoot, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Carlsbad (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 thanks to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin's 70th birthday, a monument to Yurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
This is how the name of the first cosmonaut sounds in Latvian, and it looks as if he was 70 years old.
Morse Ford murder: Activists lose Lynch's trial on stage to call for justice
The 1948 Ford Mercury drove past spectators in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and rushed to the small Morse Ford Bridge with a roar.
When the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, drove up to the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her path.
The chief - a middle-aged man in a thin stripe suit - tightened his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those inside trembled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" the man barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
The shrill wails broke the silence as a young black man was pulled from the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which played out on July 22, is just a re-enactment.
But when a noose was thrown at Roger's neck, almost all the spectators really held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to lose again the night, in 1946, the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been convicted of these murders.
"It is amazing that in all these years no one has been arrested -- although we see them next to us; although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
Brooks, 71, is a former member of Georgia's congress who has spent his life fighting for human rights.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want an investigation, we want to be completed, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We cannot move on to healing and reconciliation until we have justice."
A coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the lynching at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records obtained by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of participating in the lynching.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects remained at large for decades, human rights activists say the city has always been well aware of two linked vigilantes motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens to vote for the first time in the primaries that were to be held that summer.
Around the same time, according to the FBI, a black man, Roger Malcolm, stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner - apparently because of a woman - in a fight.
Brooks says that he was rumored to be sleeping with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and that the baby she was supposed to have was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 in bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove out of the prison and drove up to the Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison orchestrated and commanded the murders," one FBI report concluded.
"It is also clear that there was collusion between state and city law enforcement agencies who not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attack on voting rights," he says.
"They were all killed to send a message to the black people in the city: if you sign up and vote, you'll be the same."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has directed the annual play that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visible, it captures the viewer and tells the story of that deep racism, which, as many would like to believe, is no longer in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green thinks that's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own ugliness," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's play began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - gathered indoors and listened to the over-the-top review of the play.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He played the role of the clan's chief member for several years, but says the role never got any easier.
"I feel like I got dirty because I'm not the right person that I am," Marbo said.
"But I think it's important to remember this story because we don't want to go back to that time."
In the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectacle begins with Malcolm, enraged by the fact that Hester sleeps with his wife Dorothy, screams and pushes him.
I said,, get out of my house!
Rascoe shouts back.
There's a punch.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Green laughs the loudest.
"What is it?" asks Ascona.
He is concerned and confused.
Am I overplaying?
"No," Green says through laughter.
"I just don't think white people said 'nigga'."
"Yes, yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You have to call a solid 'r'."
And so does the energy in the room: discomfort gives way to a sense of camaraderie.
Everyone has to do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts over.
This time, when Rascona says the word "n," it turns out to be clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The performance ends violently and quickly.
Screams, gunshots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and performs a sad song by Billie Holiday "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
A hundred yards away from her fifty spectators wipe tears and sweat from their eyes.
Among the audience almost equal number of black and white.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York, to watch the show; many live very close.
They all endured georgia's heavy suffocatian for almost eight hours while Brooks took them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up to this point, the murders were only history, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lynched, it seems that their ghosts are in the air.
When the last note of the song subsides, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend over to their heads, touch the paint depicting blood, and immobile bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," mutters one little boy, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly it's over.
Actors throw ropes from their necks and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascoe hugs two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the play finally fell on him.
"It's all right," whispers one of the women.
"We know that your heart is good.
You had your reasons for doing so."
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta lively discusses the play with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggles to find words to describe how she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, horrible words, and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think lynchings are still going on," she adds, "only now it's called that the police are shooting."
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, took full care of the house.
He says he has already started planning next year's show.
"The production inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we've been through, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
The court fined Navalny for violations on the "agitation subbotnik"
The Simonovsky court in Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300,000 rubles for violating the order of organizing the rally.
The oppositionist was found guilty of committing an administrative offence under Article 8, 20.2 of the Russian Code "Repeated violation of the order of organizing the rally."
Earlier, the judge of the Simonov Court of Moscow, Kyzyr Moussakaev, finished considering the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the chief of staff of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was prosecuted under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 rubles.
In this amount, Judge Moussakaev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the "agitation subbotnik" that supporters of the Navalny held in Moscow on July 8-9.
Seeing the agitation materials, the police officers who were watching the participants of the Sabbath considered that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to pre-request permission from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Yudanov and Alexander Pomazuyev applied for the termination of administrative proceedings due to the absence of the offence and pointed out that the police made certain mistakes in drawing up the protocol.
Volkov was not detained at the "agitation subbotnik" but he received a summons obliging him to report to the police station to tell about the event held with his active participation.
The same subpoenas were received by Navalny and another associate of the opposition - Nikolai Lyaskin.

A court in Mordovia arrested a local man who shot dead four people at a wedding, including the bride.
This was reported in the republican office of the Investigative Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of July 29.

According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire because the wedding guests, deciding to swim, walked through the territory of his site to the reservoir.
Ministry of Energy to tighten requirements for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules of providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, hydroelectric turbines, oil pumping facilities and oil production facilities are launched, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share access data with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft resolution of the government is ready and put forward for public discussion.
The new requirements will only affect "critical energy equipment" supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document are such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of the object by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.

Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and cuts dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, British education group Pearson announced it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its pre-dividend by 72 per cent as it begins another restructuring programme aimed at tackling the challenges facing their businesses.
These job cuts, which chief executive John Fallon said will mainly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut under the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May in a third cost-cutting program to try to revive the business hit by a rapid shift to digital learning.

Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, ACCORDING to NATO.
According to unverified local sources, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Karabakh city district.

According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed nearby in Bagram.
According to the UN, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a car suicide car bombing killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.

The violence is underscoring the unsized situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is assessing whether to increase the number of U.S. military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
Correspondents said the attacks in Kabul in recent weeks had also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its lines of conduct, and especially President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
Environmental Protection Agency cancels decision to delay air pollution law after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay the passage of an Obama-era law requiring states to limit air pollution, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement so-called "ozone measurements 2015," stressing that the move shows the agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness to them," Environmental Protection Agency Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency's intention to defer ozone measurements, which measure existing air pollution in different parts of the country, to determine where it should be reduced to meet stricter air purity standards for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the federal District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit alleging that the intention was unlawful.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental ordinances introduced by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader program that Trump says is aimed at brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has drawn resistance from Democrats and conservation organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency's website states that the use of ozone-containing air for breathing "can impair lung function and exacerbate respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
Association of European Businesses speaks out against new anti-Russian sanctions

In a statement, the AEB says that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so the principles of free trade should not be limited.
European business unites more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new course of action that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
MPs ask police to restrict traffic on the embankment in Pskov
Pskov people's elected officials sent an appeal to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the city Sergei Surin about the problem of movement along the embankment of the Great River.
MPs Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Rymenenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their opinion, controlling drivers will help to make this area more peaceful and safe.
The problem is that the offenders ignore the signs "Pedestrian track" and ride freely along the embankment.
It turns out that the overhaul and improvement were carried out in vain.
Sports and playgrounds because of cars become uncomfortable.
As the Pskov Information Agency notes, in the evenings the central embankment is patrolled by PPP motorcycle patrol officers and vigilantes.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars becomes less, but the movement does not stop completely.

The head of state added that it is impossible to "create conditions that prevent the continuation of the company's activities up to the impossibility of paying taxes."

The Foreign Ministry issued a statement some time ago.
In its commentary, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using Cold War stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is talk about the possibility of a decisive match
Vasyl Lomachenko and Maikoy Garcia, who appear to be steadily moving towards the most exciting boxing match at a weight of up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of ESPN's Los Angeles channel until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's second-half champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-weight world champion Erien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are in the top five boxers regardless of weight.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriago on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for a photo, Lomachenko's manager Aegis Klimas noticed that a potential decisive fight between them would be just right.
"I used to be a featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I climbed the category for Broner's (up to 140 pounds), but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down to the half-light.
And he needs to get up to half-light ,up to 135 pounds, and then we'll have a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast via the PPV service, As part of the strategy he is pursuing, Lomachenko will make his 135-weight debut later this year to schedule a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 KOs) next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of the bout between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the world lightweight title at the Forum Arena on September 23.
"The fight could be on the PPV, because all the fans asked for it," Garcia said, later expressing his willingness to compete on the channel that would offer the best financial terms.
"We are the main names.
No other names will generate such interest.
As soon as they are ready..."
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko an "amazing boxer" and may attend Saturday's fight.
But Lomachenko did not immediately shower Garcia with praise and said he believed the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... You begged for a knockout."
Garcia said he focused on showing the force of the punch and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension was building up before their own fight.
"This fight should take place.
No other fight arouses so much interest and talk.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I was waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight."

New test results to assess age of asylum seekers in Sweden published
Recent test results for asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method of medical age assessment show that more than 80 percent of those tested were rated as over-18s, but not everyone trusted the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (R'ttsmedicinalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment of the asylum process more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the true age of some refugees claiming to be minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were rated as people 18 years of age or older, and in 25 other cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency estimated that the test was "probably 18 years of age or older."
In the case of 432 cases, the report stated that a person was "probably under 18".
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questionable.
According to Johan Goeransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are in line with the results of the past months.
"We don't see much difference with the statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as 18 did not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers had lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases," "most likely the age tested is 18 years or more."
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper "Svenska Dagbladet" found that in 243 cases people openly stated that 18 he was performing this year.
The method of conducting a medical age assessment, consisting of X-rays of wisdom teeth and knee tomography and giving them for analysis to dentists and radiologists, has also attracted criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose part of the work is to assess the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have passed through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think we should use the measurement methods that are being used now.
Biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can't define it with certainty, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told Metro newspaper.
However, Gehranssen of the Forensic Medicine Agency said in favor of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, we can say that the risk of mistakenly accepting a child as an adult is small.
We face the biggest risk when a person is soon 18, in which case he is about 10 percent."
I'll see if I'm running for president.
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was ready to consider whether he would run for the russian presidency in the elections in 2018, Interfax reports.
This statement was a reaction to the request of the residents of the village of Cheremushki in Buryat region.
During a video conference dedicated to the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when there will be the next presidential elections, we all ask you to run again for this post."
"Okay, I'll think about it, thank you," the president said in response.
On July 28, Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov commented on statements by some media outlets that Vladimir Putin's campaign headquarters would be headed by Anton Vaino, the head of the Russian presidential administration.
Peskov called these assumptions "uns based, hypothetical reasoning."
"There are no headquarters yet, it is far from the establishment of headquarters, to the election campaign," Peskov said.
"It is not on the agenda yet," Peskov said.
West Virginia governor says he's moving to another party
West Virginia Governor and Democratic Representative Jim Justice announced Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he is moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I speak to you with many prayers and many reflections... Today I say to you, to the people of West Virginia, I can no longer be of any use to you as a Democratic governor."
The rally exploded with applause.
"That's why tomorrow I'm going to change my registration to a Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to play differently."
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by a margin of 42 percent, and Justice did not support the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying, "Governor Justice's transition to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more of a hindrance than a job to make our country great again."
"Given just 15 governors and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's statement is just another rejection of a party that has no top-to-bottom leaders and is unable to find positive, unifying messages," Republican National Committee spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News.
Cat-heavyweight named Mr. Handsome found a home thanks to social networks
The nursery in Pittsboro, North Carolina, USA, has attached a cat named Mr. Handsome weighing more than 14 kilograms after he became famous thanks to the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, the nursery's Facebook account posted a photo of the cat asking to find its owner, because "it was clearly someone used to feed."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's muzzle can be a new meme.
The post has garnered more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to shelter Mr. Handsome.
As a result, it was given to Angela Frazee, who promised to take care of his overweight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, the American said that she had already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now he weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users noticed a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
The post with the photo of the animal has collected more than 68,000 views.
Commentators noted that she could well make a career in the modeling business.
Coe praises Russia's 'sincere' apology over doping scandal
International athletics specialist Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia over the doping scandal, but reiterated that now was not the right time to allow the country back into sporting events.
Dmitry Shlyakhtin, a Russian representative of the Athletics Federation, told a congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's suspension from sporting events was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all athletes who had their gold and silver medals stolen from those who had their gold and silver medals stolen at the competition."
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of state-sponsored doping.
"It seemed to me that today's response, today's report, was very sincere," Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, told reporters.
"The whole council and the whole Congress liked it... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it has been through extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation."
Coe said he also "liked" that Russia agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
"I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, according to which now is not the time to restore Russia's rights," Coe said.
"Over the next few months, we must do everything to resolve this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from a tarnished system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations will compete under a neutral flag at the World Athletics Championships, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met to restore Russia.
He told reporters in London after a report made at the board of the International Association of Athletics Federations that drug testing was still not done enough, and suspended coaches were still doing their job calmly.
Court Arrests Ukrainian Journalist Suspected of Treason
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) journalist Vasily Muravitsky was detained for two months, reports SBU.
An employee of the online publication "Jitomir's Journal" is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and infringing on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a "barbaric policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to have a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship "Commander Borsini" entered Libyan territorial waters to stop the influx of illegal migrants together with the country's navy.
The decision to launch the operation was taken by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed it with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country.
The Libyan parliament, which opposes the cabinet and is based in Tobruk, accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army Field Marshal Haftar gave his subordinates an order to oppose the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, said that they do not believe these threats and intend to send another warship to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the Europe-recognized Libyan cabinet Faiz Saraj.
Italian authorities have launched a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics on the number of illegal immigrants entering the country from Libya were made public in July: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The government said the resources to receive migrants had been exhausted.

Olga Earthman and Olesya Vvkh, who specialize in short-distance running, are excluded from the Ukrainian national team for the 2017 World Championships in London.
This is reported on the website of the Country Athletics Federation (FLAU).
This decision was made by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against track and field athletes by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
The Ukrainian delegation has also been excluded from the coach Sergey Basenko.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects athletes of doping.

The World Athletics Championships in London will be held from August 4 to 13.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unrestricted spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain.
Whatever the consequences may follow, for Paris Saint-Germain, uefa, the governing body that oversees European football, whose authority to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the rules of the financial fair play introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to free the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can definitely fork out to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Catalonia.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on player purchases, but they have to balance them at the expense of legitimate sources of income to reach the profitability threshold in their football business.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that were in huge debts in their quest for success were in fact cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on the debts of the clubs and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with good potential and then spend heavily in order to improve the team and create a global brand - has become an impossible plan.
During this three-year valuation period, which is exciting in 2018, clubs could suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini's disgrace as president in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Alexander Ceferin, is still determined to curb excessive spending.
"Of course, FFP is alive, and we will tighten the rules, moving forward," Andrea Traverso, who controls UEFA's FFP, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay a lump sum for Neymar's contract, he can distribute this amount for the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in annual reports as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG and Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City were severely sanctioned.
PSG were fined 60 million euros (at that rate of $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and it was ordered to limit the composition of their team in the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspections by inflating their revenue from companies linked to the club's owners.
Although the company could sponsor PSG, if the amount of financing was considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of funding from PSG from the Tourism Authority of catalonia was inflated.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's earnings at PSG could have come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in the country.
However, PSG and the 2022 catalans deny that Neymar will become an ambassador for the World Cup, and such a manoeuvre could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more closely monitoring any attempts to circumvent the rules.
According to people familiar with the situation, UEFA did not have preliminary discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss PSG's situation.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016 PSG received more than 10 million euros in profit with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The report for the last financial year has not yet been published.
PSG expect that the arrival of Neymar will be a fertile ground for sponsorship deals, the sale of paraphernalia and T-shirts with the team logo.
The club expects turnover to grow by at least 30 per cent due to the hiring of a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best players is leaving, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neymar's transfer, saying that PSG would disrupt the financial fair play.
"This is an obvious case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to psg's ultimate owner being the catalan.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's doubts about the club's funding of the state.
"It's all about the impact of equity and it's completely changed the landscape of football over the last fifteen years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to observe the financial fair play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and places of swearing will be determined by the president
Where and how the new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the president - such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law developed by the State Duma Committee on Law and State Construction.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the procedure of swearing in the law.
Children under the age of 18 will be exempt from taking a solemn oath, as well as incapacitated children, according to the revised text of amendments to the bill "On the citizenship of the Russian Federation" (there is at the disposal of "Izvestia"), which the committee will consider on July 11 before the second reading at its meeting.
President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of taking the oath of office when he became a citizen of the Russian Federation instead of formally signing the documents on June 6 during a meeting with State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The MPs drafted this idea as an amendment to the second reading of the bill providing for the abolition of the decision to grant citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (v. 2 p. 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for the hijacking of an airplane trains or water transport, but only if this act is related to terrorism (v. 4 p. 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, his logic was this: by issuing documents for citizenship, a person signs under a promise to comply with Russian law - embarking on the path of extremism, he breaks this promise.
The bill was introduced to the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev ("United Russia"), Gennady Syuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Jirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov ("Fair Russia") and the speaker of the DG Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been reworked again.
Now it says that the order of swearing is set by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, the parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law on russian citizenship, indicating that the ceremony should be held in a solemn atmosphere in front of the state coat of arms and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Interior Ministry.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where the russian coat of arms can be placed is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state bodies, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive authorities, etc.
Most likely, it could be registry offices.
Those wishing to obtain Russian citizenship will make a solemn oath after the officials check their documents.
But a Russian passport will be obtained only after he takes the oath, it follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, not from 14.
There is a rule that incapacitated or limited able-bodied persons will be released from swearing, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the oath themselves.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and "other persons"
Also, the updated bill spells out a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of Ukrainians who are considered native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship, having submitted the relevant application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the statement will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
The renunciation of "foreign" citizenship, as now, would not be required if it was provided for by an international treaty or if it was not possible "for reasons beyond the control of the individual".
A group of deputies, including the first vice-speaker of the DG Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all - "United Russia") proposed the relevant amendment to the law.
I think many of you know that it is impossible to get a certificate from Ukraine.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for a decision on their fate on the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the head of the Duma Committee on State Construction and Law Pavel Krasheninnikov (EP).
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have given up their "other" citizenship in writing and surrendered their former passport to the Russian Interior Ministry, but "for reasons beyond his control" he has not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are forbidden to hold positions in the municipal service, to be hired on facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or residence permit of another country cannot become a member of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should come into force on September 1, 2017, by which time the necessary by-laws should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes niche in "The Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
The current iteration of history nostalgically recalls at the same time the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; about the grunge era in the 90s (around the time when outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Schovalter made the comedy sketches "State" for MTV); and about herself - that is, about 2001, before her stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd moved on to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is both the exaltation and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise it seems anachronistic.
"The First Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, and not just because of absurdist humor (including the original story of a talking jar of vegetables, which was voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually preoccupied children who have just reached adulthood; thanks to this inability to return to becomes part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," where adults played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more haphazard and includes riffs from 90s stalker films like "Hands Rocking the Cradle."
In one episode, the character pulls out an Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the plot moves are the same.
Good-natured Coop (Showolter), now a writer, still hasn't achieved reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't given up on his virginity.
And then there's the mad and vile conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Shawolter), who is now instigated by George H.W. Bush (a tried and tested parody by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the deviation from it.
It's especially funny to see the ever-young Rudd singing a Matt Dillon song from Lonely, whose character, and former big man Andy looks now an old man.
To bring this franchise success could be random madness in the spirit of the recursive series "Seven Up" until it reaches what, in my opinion, would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where in the last scene the whole company would go to the cinema for the premiere of the film "Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon turns to another type of nostalgia: cold war memories of "The Americans," "Explosive Blonde" or even "Glitter" with its images of east-West struggles.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Reese Thomas, depicts a TV movie: a Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The main roles - who saw the life of Gregor and idealist Joseph - are played by Florin Piersik Jr. and Cornelio Ulic, and their dialogues in English Channing Tatum (aka executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But just an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (police spend time watching a chess match as Americans might watch football).
The team of famous voice-overs - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - allows you to play "guess the voice" interestingly.
But "Comrade Detective" holds on to the credibility of a clumsy propaganda drama - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask - that often looks like it.
Six long episodes are drawn out, and funny is not very and not often.
If it were to be made shorter, "Comrade Detective" could better cope with his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American Embassy, two fat people sit in the lobby, eating a bunch of hamburgers.
This image of an imaginary communist viewer says that Western culture is able to make fat obese out of anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: We do so even with our own recent history, and with theirs too.
The prize fund for the match for the Russian Super Cup between Spartak and Lokomotiv will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergei Prydkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, REPORTS RT.
He added that to date there are almost no tickets for the match.
The match between Spartak and Lokomotiv will take place on Friday, July 14 at 21:30.
As TASS notes, Spartak is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and Lokomotiv is the winner of the Cup of the country.
Two young Ufims cleaned the furniture shop for 200,000 rubles
The other day, a 37-year-old Ufim man with a furniture company contacted the police.
The man claimed to have stolen expensive tools from the shop, causing serious damage to its production.
The thieves' extractions were tools with a total value of almost 200,000 rubles: two welding machines, a puncher, a hydraulics, a winch.
Guards of order began to search for criminals and soon went to the residents of the Blessed district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years.
According to the press service of the Interior Ministry of the Republic, the accomplices entered the territory of the enterprise, broke the front door and took out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first service station.
A case of theft has already been opened against them, and the law enforcement officers managed to return only a part of the stolen tools to the rightful owner.
State Department comments on Medvedev's words about Russia-U.S. relations
The U.S. and Russia should be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert in response to Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's remarks about the two states' relations.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared a full-fledged trade war for Russia.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that U.S.-Russian relations are at a "low level", but noted that it is necessary to look for "areas for cooperation."
"Look at the truce in southwest Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," RIA Novosti quoted the diplomat as saying.
At the same time, the representative of the Foreign Ministry refused to comment on the statement of the Russian prime minister that sanctions amount to a trade war.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea last Wednesday.
At the same time, he acknowledged that the document is unsuccessful and contradicts the American Constitution.
Dior "raised" roses from amethysts and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has added to the collection of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They had five new rings and three choker necklaces on velvet ribbons.
In the line Rose Dior Pr' Catelan released two new rings and pendant of amethyst, pink quartz and diamonds made in the technique of glyptic (hand carving on stone) and pavage and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoire de Castellane was inspired by roses grown on his Granville estate by fashion designer Christian Dior, and the Parisian gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catellan.
Trump finds culprits in deteriorating relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply criticized members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions led to the deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an all-time low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the president tweeted.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House issued a statement of the president, in which he indicated that the law will not allow the U.S. to conclude profitable deals and will further bring Russia, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refuses to buy Ukrainian daughter Sberbank
Viktor Prokopenya, an entrepreneur from Belarus, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to buy a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention to "concentrate on our other planned investments and projects on which we are working."
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a move would be the "best investment of time" despite the investment attractiveness of buying Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main bidder for the purchase of a russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortium Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gutseriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after president Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
Sberbank became one of these financial institutions - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank.
Novak named the reason for the blackout in Crimea
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation named the reason for the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, made an explanation about the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident in the Krasnodar region.
The truck involved in the accident hit power lines, as a result of which the Cuban and related Crimean networks were shut down.
Power outages in major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Experts fixed the problem within a few hours.
It was initially reported that the cause of the blackout could have been abnormal heat.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have prompted rumours of a possible rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain slow, and has left interest rates unchanged amid mounting pressure on household incomes.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep rates at 0.25 per cent, with fewer members in favour of a rate hike this month because weak economic growth weakened support for the hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts for a 1.7 percent rise in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3 percent in the fall.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years would be needed to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said borrowing costs were likely to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to abandon part of the huge set of measures to develop the economy, launched a year ago in the wake of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close an urgent financing plan under which it provides banks with cheap loans, although it said it now has to provide another 15 billion pounds - up to 115 billion pounds - as part of the plan.
In its report on the rate decision, the bank said: "According to the MPC's main forecasts, gross domestic product (GDP) growth remains slow in the near term, while pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption."
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that "some tightening of fiscal policy" would be needed to halt inflation, at a "slightly higher" rate than markets expect.
At the moment, markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The bank's forecasts for an increase this year and next are lower than forecasts made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left its forecast unchanged by 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 percent to $1.31 and 0.4 percent to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate came after recent disappointing growth figures eased the increased expectation of a hike; GDP then grew by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little cause for joy to households hit by high inflation and very minor wage increases: the bank said the pressure would increase before it was reduced.
The bank added that the financial policy "cannot prevent" a share of earnings in the next few years, but expects wages to "significantly" recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of the growing demand for British goods, thanks to the low value of the pound, which offset some of the low consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shocking results of the referendum on leaving the European Union, which led to the fall in the pound.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its latest decision on rates, there was a growing buzz around the proposed rate hike as inflation put more pressure on already under-pressure households: three of the committee's experts asked for a rate hike to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank, this drop was expected and in the coming months again compensated.
According to the bank, the higher rate compared to the planned 2% is entirely a consequence of the low value of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Mortgage Brokers Koreco, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive again as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good end to the year.
The market looks particularly favorable for those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of no commission, as well as with a low rate, becomes more popular than ever."
The NHS will prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a "revolutionary" HIV prevention drug after a high court battle over FUNDING for the drug from the NHS.
Nhs England has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis of HIV (PrEP), a pre-exposure pill taken before sex, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in people at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year trial period of about 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the ordeal after an appeals court upheld a High Court ruling last year that argued that the National Health Service had the ability to pay PrEP, despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, announced on Thursday, was described as a "major innovation" by The President of NHS England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it a "turning point."
Before the full launch of the programme across England by April 2018, veneerological dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start registering people, with more dispensaries joining the programme in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PrEP before sex in the human body enough certain drugs to prevent infection with HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include gay and bisexual men, transgender people, and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensaries will select suitable participants who agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and those whose partners are not known whether their HIV status is contained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a GP in England will also be able to apply for a potential participation in the nearest venereal dispensary participating in the programme.
The programme will cost 10 million pounds, and NHS England this week signed a contract to provide the drug after an international tender for the purchase.
The study is designed to assess all of PrEP's capabilities by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its assimilation and use on a large scale.
"This critical innovation should complement and strengthen large-scale and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of the NAT (National AIDS Control Authority), said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if you properly target people who need help and are at risk, makes a difference in the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk from HIV, thanks to this study being conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new new opportunity, a means that people can control themselves without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The first step now is to ensure that the test unfolds quickly across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is forgotten.
Now that we have the experimental PrEP drug, we are moving to protect more than 10,000 people at risk from HIV."
Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: "We very welcome the start of the PREP trial, it is very late due to months of delays and delays by the government."
The data demonstrate how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the test be deployed throughout the country as soon as possible to protect people at risk of HIV and to move us one step further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution to support the treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the post of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a positively proven form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people."
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
The agreement between Moscow and Kazan, which has been in place since July 24, 2007, was concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and keep the title of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only entity of the federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "president."
In Russia, there were difficulties in obtaining international driver's licenses
The units of the traffic police are experiencing a shortage of international driver's licenses(
To get such rights, you have to wait in line for several weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go on vacation abroad in their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driver's licenses remains contradictory.
The IWU was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as the information in it was explained in five languages.
Requirements for international rights are written into the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic in 1968, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as well.
However, in reality, everything depends on specific police officers or rental offices: some require MVU, and someone has enough national rights.
To insure, drivers still receive international rights, but it is worth bearing in mind that in the countries that have not ratified the convention (e.g. usa, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or IWU.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all units of the traffic police, Kommersant reports, having conducted a study in a number of regions.
Thus, in Moscow, in the units of UGIBDD coupons simply do not give out, forms are not enough for four months.
You can make an appointment on the website of state services, but there the queue has already stretched until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to obtain MVU "for technical reasons" without going into details, in the Samara region honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation is developing in other cities.
The problem has already faced many Muscovites, in social networks more and more often there are such messages:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why moscow can't get international rights?"
That's right, because all the offices of the traffic police have run out of forms.
Elena Podzinakol: "A question to knowledgeable people!"
We need to get international rights very urgently.
In Moscow all the time packed far ahead, on the spot coupons do not issue at all (there is a button, but the coupon can not give).
It seems that the portal of state services shows that in St. Petersburg time is free to fig.
Has anyone tried getting in another city?
Work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for forms of international driver's licenses have changed, so the state inspection unit of the State Automobile Inspectorate is carrying out the delivery of new forms.
This may be the reason for the deficit, although it is not clear what changes are in question, previously it was not reported.
The forms are purchased by the Special Operations Center for Road Safety (CSN) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then supplied them to the units of the traffic police.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with Goznak: in 2014-2015, almost 200,000 forms of MVU were made, in 2016 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90,000, but the last contract was signed on July 18 with "First Printed Yard" LLC for the manufacture of 70,000 forms.
There is a version that the CSN simply did not have time to hold the tender, which is why there was a shortage.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to go independently not to Europe, and to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there, it is not clear, so people are reinsured, so there was a rush of demand for international "crusts."
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to pass an exam to confirm their qualifications.
The Ministry of Transport made such a proposal.
The new international driver's license has been in force since May 31, 2011.
Ukraine's Justice Minister refuses to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko said he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge to Crimea.
He said this in an interview with the Observer portal on Friday, August 4.
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or a fortune there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the United States, Japan - in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia regarding Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, this project actually has no prospects," Petrenko said.
He added that he considers Russia unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot build smaller-scale facilities normally.
I know that after the Olympic Games in Sochi whole stadiums have already begun to collapse.
"Therefore, I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have proved so short-sighted to join this project," the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the arch of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kerch coast, the enlarged assembly of the road arch of the Crimean Bridge has been completed: its vault is closed at an altitude of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, the bridge builders prepared the railway arch for installation on the fairway supports," the project's information center said.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility is ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula and the Krasnodar region.
An official who hasn't gone to work for 10 years has been fired in Spain
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should have had the head of the Spanish official Carles Recio?
Permanent truancy stretched for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was dismissed.
But not his immediate boss.
That only in the world of bureaucrats does not happen.
Everyman, it seems, has long been accustomed to all the pranks of "servants of the people."
And, nevertheless, officials all the time manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time the "sensation" came from Spain.
There, the employee of the archives of Valencia Carles Recio managed for ten years not to go to work.
At the same time, he regularly received a salary.
And all solid - 50,000 euros a year.
And now Mr. Recio's "wonderful times" are over.
He was fired by the Valencia Legislative Assembly.
During the investigation it turned out that the hard-core truant every working morning came to the office at 07:00 to check in the electronic system.
And then he went home.
Once again he appeared at the workplace at 16:00 to again note in the system that he had left.
And so it is 10 years.
It also became known that all his free time truant devoted to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia are thinking how to punish and direct chief Mr. Recio, who could not help but know how to "actively work" in his workplace his subordinate.
Judges are offered to protect from the presidents
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC) on behalf of Vladimir Putin has drafted proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
HRC proposes to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts and to introduce their electability.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in Russia.
The Supreme Court must also submit its proposals as part of the presidential order.
HRC has finalized proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the HRC on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the president gave after a meeting with council members.
At the meeting with the members of the council on December 8, 2016, separate cases of judicial arbitrariness were discussed, as well as problems of public control in the places of detention of citizens (see "Y" of December 9).
The HRC's work resulted in 25 proposals, which dealt both with the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors, as well as funding for courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to increase the independence of the rest of the judges.
If a candidate for the position of a judge successfully passed the contest and received the support of the judicial community, the chairman of the court, in the opinion of the HRC, should submit it to the appointment, not having the right to refuse, as the law allows now.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to refer cases to judges.
Do this, experts admit, can specially written computer program.
The HRC also considers that the chairman has no right to "prejudge the results of the qualification of the judge, initiate his bringing to disciplinary responsibility, make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments."
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to "elect the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves" and "to empower them for a relatively short period with mandatory rotation".
Now all the presidents of the courts (from the republican to the district) are appointed for six years by the president on the recommendation of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, HRC proposes to re-organize appeals and appeals in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in Russia.
The HRC says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation, not at the level of regional courts in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts."
Experts take the practice of arbitration courts as the basis.
They have "judicial districts" that do not coincide with the administrative division in Russia, but guarantee greater independence from regional officials, who are hampered by the use of "telephone law."
Hrc's magistrates propose to strengthen the people's jurors to consider some "categories of civil and administrative cases" with their participation.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the reinstatement at work, the protection of honor and dignity, the deprivation of a driver's license, etc.
"These are only our proposals," explained Tamara Morshchakova, a retired member of the HRC and a judge of the Constitutional Court.
She also recalled that the President's order applied not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court ,VS), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
The Armed Forces (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in Russia) still have time to carry out the assignment.
The Chairman of the Armed Forces Vyacheslav Lebedev has until September 1 to report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in Russia.
Living a high life: Semi-storey and cunning design tricks have turned this small apartment in Earls Court into a spacious dwelling
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a spacious home in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the ground floor of a pretty model house in the style of queen Anne, and in favor of the new design says that Joan did not pack her things and did not move again.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area," says Joan.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered a price on the same day."
Since first viewing, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Originally it was a one-bedroom apartment - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a semi-floor to squeeze maximum use out of the generous height of the ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands," she says.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill architectural and design studio Duck and Shed to use the 12.5-foot-tall ceilings and create a dwelling that would not only be a successful project, but would be suitable for Joan's life.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two rooms one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-floor, where you could stand in full height.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the brief.
"Working with steel structures is very difficult," he explains.
"We had to position the rooms so that they were one above the other, and we didn't have to bend.
It was necessary not just to build a simple platform, but so bend the structures, so that they were at the right height and allowed to use the rooms from above and below."
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms one above the other in the all-out space - and many more interesting things.
Retrouvius overlooks the chic living room below.
Mirror furniture with a golden finish, silver accents and vintage lighting devices from Serge Mooy set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of entertainment, space and light.
The short corridor is framed by mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored security panel appears to be a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored cabinets serve to store all of Joan's utensils.
To create a sense of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
The folding kitchens are nothing new.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a moving up door, like in a garage.
"Engineering was involved here," Erfan said of the steel-reinforced wood-fiber shield door.
"It's equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the judicious use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, floor space is exactly what you're going to sell, that is, what your property is valued for," Erfan says.
"Roughly speaking, a real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on the floor area."
Here they were able to increase the floor area, using high-quality materials that give the space a tinge of luxury.
"Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with the house," Erfan says.
"No one falls in love with wiring in the walls.
It is important, but it does not touch the strings of our hearts."
This is an indication that due to good design and increased meterage, the apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you may decide to stay.
The government approved the creation of a commission on cultural policy
The Russian government has approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant ruling is published on the government's website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, refine tasks and prepare new programs for its implementation.
The head of the commission has been appointed deputy head of the Russian government.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2016 approved a plan to implement the strategy of state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 events and provides for measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, as well as contribute to creating conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries reduced to eight-year low
The growth of consumer prices in the G20 countries has fallen to its lowest level in eight years, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation in June 2016 was 2% - lower values were observed in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The target of inflation in Russia, according to calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been achieved - according to this agency, the figure is 4%.
Putin warns against illegal logging of Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against illegal destruction of forests during a meeting on environmental development of the natural Baikal territory.
During the event, Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
It permits deforestation during the elimination of fires, and the government plans to adopt it as early as the fall.
In his turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of cutting down "everything is not cut down."
Donskoy noted that the bill involves control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory agencies.
Media: fighters of the Armed Forces secretly from the command agree with the militias of Donbass
On the line of armed confrontation in donbass established regular telephone communication.
Fighters of the warring parties constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known in the headquarters.
Fighters of the Armed Forces and militias of Donbass established communication on cell phones in secret from their high command.
This was reported by "Country.ua" on August 4, citing the participants of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the newspaper, the commanders of the units know the names of their colleagues from the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on the phone every day.
Communication is not domestic: commanders are trying to reach some "tactical agreements."
Often as a result of such conversations there is a truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when congratulations on the birthday of one or another officer received from behind the front line, from his formal enemy.
Fighters of the Armed Forces and militias of DNR and LNR have been sitting in the trenches on the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbass.
Foreign Ministry outraged by blocking UN Security Council statements on attacks on Russian embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives, who block the statements of the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2 was subjected to mortar fire by terrorists of the "Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham" (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in Russia) and Faylaq Al-Rahman for the third time in a month.
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in the qualification of Nusra as a terrorist organization, and UN Security Council resolutions call to oppose this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, it seems, it seems, it is no matter that the Nusra attacks should be met with universal unconditional and decisive condemnation, and in the assessment of attacks against diplomatic missions there should be no ambiguity."
However, as stressed in the diplomatic service, "for the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of the objections, hiding behind arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard brief statement of the Security Council for the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital."
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us may remain on the conscience of these delegations.
"The most outrageous thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the actions of terrorists encourages them to further provocations and terrorist attacks, makes them feel impunity," the Foreign Ministry said, adding that "we would not like these barbarians to be convinced that someone in the Security Council is with them."
Vladimir Putin advocates limiting the number of unscheduled inspections of business
During the meeting on investment projects in the Far East, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the number planned, and also said that it is necessary to limit the period of inspections to ten days.
"Unscheduled inspections are usually carried out without proper coordination with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% is coordinated with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes independently," TASS quoted the president as saying.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be banned from confiscating servers and hard drives in enterprises.
In addition, according to the President, business associations should get the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will make some positive in the consideration of cases related to business activities, or related to the violation of the law in the sphere of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
As reported by Yu, due to the moratorium on routine inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, on the order of the business ombudsman under Russian President Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, which revealed that there was actually substitution of planned inspections by unscheduled (the share of those faced with them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutorial (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raid (from 7.9% to 13.3%), and checks on citizens' applications (growth from 15% to 19.5%). administrative investigations (10.8% to 15.5%).

Brothers fight for more than $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and property developer Colin de Lutis lives in The Palace of Toorak three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has filed a claim against him in the Supreme Court for the division of possessions and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still facing a bitter dispute over the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought a shop on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded the firm Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the List of De Lutis family properties now includes office buildings, plots for development in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and in Mount Buller and shopping centres in the suburbs.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third.
According to court records, this means That Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
The first Supreme Court hearings were held last Friday after several failed reconciliation attempts.
The brothers are now arguing over who will control the existing business - from which, according to Paul, Colin ruled him out.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of mismanagement of some objects.
In testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family a top priority," he wrote.
Court costs are rising like a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been added to the case; Both parties have attracted some of the most prominent lawyers, including the royal lawyer Allan Myers, and the best concoctions.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; They ran dairy bars and delis in the late 1950s, and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family-run jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last grade of school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their possessions to their sons without conflict.
"Luigi often told me that he didn't want the brothers to go to court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; Colin says Mark got $10 million when he went out of business, and Luke got $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their office."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL club's board of directors and, according to a 2015 biography published by Eddie McGuire, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded by texting, saying that since the case had not yet been tried in court, "I really have nothing to say."
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to put our family's name in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in testimony that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want to see Paul and I arguing in court," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a resolution of the conflict."
That hope seemed to dissipate on Friday.
"The decision in our case will soon be handed down by the court," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's access.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly will really succeed.
In that case, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media - hoping to keep the chief in a calmer state.
That's what reporter Josh Dawie says.
"At a meeting held by the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, with his chief of staff on his first day in office, he identified a major issue in the White House under President Donald Trump that he hopes to address: poor channels of information to the president."
Kelly told staff that information should go through it - in paper form or through briefings - because the president would be better off making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is perfectly correct, but others have already failed in trying to subdue Trump by tracking his information.
President Trump's relationship with television began decades ago - and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, resented the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was helpful to show him that he was getting fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded," Sam Nanberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote in Politico at the time that "according to six former members of the campaign, in order to keep in check Trump's habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to make sure that there was a constant stream of praise in the information he received personally."
Ok.
But the idea that Trump's habit of tweeting on Twitter has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the campaign know something we don't know - for example, that if it weren't for them, Trump's tweets would have been even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump didn't post.
If his staff kept him out of trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever managed to keep Trump from adding fuel to the fire.
Part of the problem is that in a White House divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving Trump material - reliable or not - that confirms their views.
Politico - just in time for this story - wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly shove the president questionable information.
Here's one example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump staffers say that Trump can respond very harshly to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
That's what happened in late February, when someone slipped the president a printout of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles K. Johnson, in which Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Welsh was accused of "standing behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is forever banned on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he didn't provide specific facts or that in the past he ran false accusations and then denied them.
Trump read the article and started asking staff about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary of Staff Rob Porter "tried to build a system to manage and document the flow of papers that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly is trying to do the same.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen prosecutor's office fights HIV dissident
The prosecutor's office challenged the ruling of the Kalinin District Court of Tyumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local woman whose young daughter died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was hiv dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court absolved her of responsibility in connection with her reconciliation with her father.
The Prosecutor's Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished in order not to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was initiated under Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (causing death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died from HIV infection 4In stage.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
"The woman was not treated herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist," the prosecutor's office of the Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case was submitted to the Kalinin district court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to stop it.
The petition was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that he "forgave his wife, has no complaints against her, she made amends and apologized".
The Prosecutor's Office disagreed with the court's decision and appealed, demanding that the order to dismiss the case be overturned and sent to a new hearing.
The girl died, and it is impossible to make amends for the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her for a dangerous infection," the press service of the prosecutor's office said.
According to the supervisory body, she should be punished, otherwise her example will be followed by other HIV dissidents.
According to the Tyumen AIDS Center, there are now about 12 children with HIV in the Tyumen region who do not receive medical care because of their parents' refusal.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of work of the special group half of parents who categorically refused to treat children from HIV, changed their minds - allowed to make a diagnosis, began to take drugs," - said spokeswoman of the AIDS Center Elena Loseva.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents by legislative means, and as a result not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV dissidents?
Late last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of Russia's first study of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and in their spread see a serious threat.
The terrible photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Railway Station grechana in Khmelnitsky.
A cheerful company of drunken young people strolled the bridge over the railway tracks, where just stood a freight train.
One of his friends had the idea to take a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, FACTAM reported in the police communications sector in the Khmelnitskaya region.
The guy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but because of his indiscretion he caught on the power line and was immediately electrocuted.
Fortunately, the station manager became aware of this case, who immediately called an "emergency".
Before the arrival of doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnitskaya Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with burns to his torso of 1 to 2 degrees.
Now his condition is assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement officers remind that in recent years extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, moving transport are becoming more and more popular.
Police are urging people to be vigilant and avoid such photo shoots, especially among children and teenagers.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
On ancient Venus there could have been oceans.
This assumption was made by French scientists.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of the planets, science News writes.
It turned out that on Venus at the beginning of its history formed oceans, which had 10% more water than now on Earth.
Earlier, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean 4 billion years ago could exist on Mars.
Foreign experts in the course of their research came to the conclusion that the water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.

Gypsies overcame the moat and returned to the "street of millionaires"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again at odds with the determined Gypsies, who have overcame a moat dug by the municipal authorities to retake the field next to their homes.
Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the affluent Solihull Street, which has been jokingly dubbed "millionaires' street."
Bringing horses, infants and many houses on wheels, they returned after being kicked out no further than in May, and were not prevented from digging a moat dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactful company found a gap in the defensive structures and squeezed its vehicles through the area, which was left undeward to leave room for the footpath.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihull, saying it was "unable to solve this problem".
An anonymous local resident said: "They came here on Monday evening after being driven from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by."
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act, because they are completely incapable of solving this problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were driven away, and now they're back.
There were more gypsies last night, and more today, perhaps even more.
"The City of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I don't like the way I continue to pay council tax and the municipality can't even put an end to it."
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw these gypsies leave the previous time, and please, this attack continues."
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse grazing in the meadow."
A Solihulla municipality spokesman said: "We are aware of an illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with Solihull Police; we are taking the necessary legal action to get them out as soon as possible."
To help us collect evidence, it is important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police on 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the Champagne winery "New World"
The "New World Champagne Factory" has been decided to be corporatized by converting it into a "New World Champagne Winery" according to the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anyukhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in the state property of Crimea.
The share capital of the company will be 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares with a face value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if within the next three years there are no funds for the modernization of the plant, there will be a threat to stop the plant.
Depreciation of fixed assets in the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The company needs 1.2 billion rubles for the modernization of the enterprise.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"Getting money from the owner is problematic, it is difficult to talk about borrowing large credit organizations," said Sergei Petelin, deputy head of the Crimean Agriculture Ministry, in April this year.
The Crimean parliament has included the company in the projected privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to hold its corporatization and put up for auction.
The source of "Interfax" in the Crimean authorities estimated the possible cost of the sale of the enterprise at $40 million, the investor's investment in modernization - another $30 million.
New World increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% in 2016 compared to 2015 levels - to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, New World intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn as a plant for the production of sparkling wine in the New World estate he acquired.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third-graders smashed more than 40 tombstones
Officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Nizhny Novgorod region have identified the citizens who destroyed 46 tombstones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers were third-grade students.
The first statement that the gravestones were damaged by unknown people was received by the Russian Interior Ministry in the Lyskovsky district on June 27.
A total of 24 people contacted the police.
As a result, a criminal case was opened under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites."
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, they were two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9 years.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested to see how the monuments fell, and this prompted them to act hooliganism.
Preventive measures have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone on NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs that own rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue their work unless they comply with new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had only been working for a year, declined to comment on the merits of the detailed charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue our activities in the search and rescue zone now," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We will be able to assess all the charges made now only after we have gathered all the information and been able to assess the situation."
Italian authorities have been monitoring the ship Juventa, owned by Jugend Rettet, since October.
Its crew is suspected of taking whole lifeboats on board migrants who were sent directly to them by traffickers and allowing smugglers to leave with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecution, which was published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the instructions of the Italian coastguard authorities, who control rescue operations in the area, more out of humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct assumes, mainly, that Juventa-type vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to obey the code: Save the Children, Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it believed the new rules were unnecessary but acceptable, provided they did not cause any "meaningful changes or interference" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is also the Nobel Prize-winning organization "Medecins Sans Frontieres" (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have started to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict"
The Russian authorities have recently significantly increased their policy on the Libyan direction, and delegations of the warring Libyan parties have become involved with visits to Moscow.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement at the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma, assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Degov told "Y" what goals Moscow pursues in the region and who is betting.
Almost nothing is known about the contact group on Libya, which you head.
Here, let's say, the contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The contact group was created at the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are overseen by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Deputy of the Duma from Chechnya.
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan direction by the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanic Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "Y").
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
And how did it happen that you were the one who led it?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I was approached with an offer to lead the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from chebotarev's Mechanics.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all the main factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - both from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government led by Faiz Saraj. - "Y") is based, and with Tobruk (the seat of parliament, which opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya.
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Libya's Vice-Premier - "Y"), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to make better use of these contacts, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, we are engaged in a dialogue with everyone.
How many people are part of the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
Now the contact group consists of five people.
Among them there are people with experience in law enforcement agencies, including the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to introduce representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of the Russian Academy of Sciences as part of the group of specialists in the region.
There are no permanent employees in Libya, and this is not necessary yet.
Are there Russian military advisers and instructors in Libya now?
And if so, which side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about it are not true.
But your contact group includes the former military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities that have been closed up to a certain point, such as Misrata (where militias that played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and have been noticeably intensified in the following years.
We came to Misrata in January this year.
We were scared, told that there were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what is the real role of Islamists there.
In Misrata, we met with all the representatives of the groups that were engaged in the destruction of IS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from the militants of the banned Islamic State in Russia - "Y").
We wanted to look at them, meet these people, check the information that they played a decisive role in the destruction of IS in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits.
And what conclusion did you come to?
Is Islamic State not Haftar defeated in Libya?
He wasn't the one who did it.
Haftar was conducting operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And with IS in Sirte, the government-controlled structures in Tripoli were fighting.
And, by the way, we invited people to Russia who carried out this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from April 19 to April 23 this year, the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, the Duma, the Foreign Ministry and the Russian Guard.
You, as we understand, are in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the mood of local elites and warlords.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements and elections reached in Paris at the end of July by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as has happened many times in the past, agreements will be broken, hostilities will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
For us, a good signal was the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to the next meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, the two leaders have been very negative about each other.
And as for Russia's position...
Often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe in it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misrata, and Haftar on that day climbed aboard the Russian aircraft carrier "Admiral Kuznetsov".
It was a coincidence.
But in Misrata they did not believe in coincidence.
We were told, "You must be very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is to show that we do not support only Haftar, we are in dialogue with all the key players in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar talked.
Does mutual understanding with Russian partners on a human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he studied twice in the USSR?
And by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
If he knows Russian, he is very concerning.
But the fact that he studied with us, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And by the way, it's not just him.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And now they speak Russian perfectly.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent they are nostalgic for it.
Do you think it is likely that the arms embargo imposed on Libya will be lifted soon?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in Russian arms supplies?
They are interested, of course, but, as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict and do not want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
As for the arms embargo, there are constant calls from the Libyans that Russia somehow contribute to its removal.
The process of drafting a constitution is now actively progressing in Libya.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and achieve internal consensus.
Then the elections should be held, as mentioned at the meeting of Saraj and Haftar.
If the elections are held and the legitimate government is finally elected (and now neither side has such status), it is possible to put the issue of lifting the arms embargo in the UN Security Council.
It is pointless and dangerous to raise this issue now, but it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees sailing from Libya, feels abandoned to the fate of allies from the EU.
Can Moscow help its Italian partners in this situation by using its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is Haftar's group of troops to take control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers smuggling immigrants to Europe?
It's a very timely question.
We are actively working on it.
The Italians need Russia's support because Moscow is engaged in dialogue with Haftar, Saraj, Misrata and the south of the country.
And in this matter the tribes in southern Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about southerners stopping the flow of migrants on distant approaches?
So, conventionally speaking, were the buses carrying Nigerian migrants going back?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these streams going.
We hope to help unite the southerners in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first, we would like to see unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of the government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist who is a supporter of the introduction of Sharia law in the country.
How radical is he?
Wouldn't that be an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll give you my personal opinion of him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be a perfectly normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
And it is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where does he get that reputation?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where there is a legislative, executive and judicial branch.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in us not getting there.
And we mixed all the cards for them and began to actively communicate with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the benefits of this work: Rosneft has entered into a cooperation agreement with Libya's state oil company, NOC.
NOC Director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosneft's head Igor Sechin struck a deal, is himself from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I suppose it's reselling.
And what are Russia's economic interests in Libya?
Plans to re-sign contracts signed under Muammar Gaddafi.
These include previous agreements in the transport sector (railway construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, as in the case of Iran, we are talking about the oil-for-services scheme?
I don't know what the scheme will be, I don't deal with these issues directly.
In fact, the economy is not the main thing for Russia in Libya.
We are there, in fact, engaged in peacekeeping work.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans to agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya ceases to be a conducive environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and squeeze out terrorists.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date no natives from Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union are not there.
He said that he had about 50,000 phone records of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "Y") and that the Russian speech did not sound there.
And from which states are these militants then?
I don't want to go into that detail.
Then let's formulate the question differently.
How many Islamist militants are Libyans in Libya?
There are almost no Libyans among them, there are no more than 5%.
The rest are newcomers.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks following the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are holding active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have declared their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
And when can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say right now.
Several more visits are to take place, and then I hope that there will be clarity about the time and place of the negotiations.
In the Chekhov museum philanthropists collected money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
In the Moscow museum-reserve "Melichovo" nine-year-old boy Sasha Matsola, who has cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus of the brain and complete blindness, on August 5 will receive a specialised treadmill as a gift.
The minister of culture of the Moscow region Oksana Kosareva and the director of the museum Konstantin Bobkov will present a useful presentation to Sasha.
The money for the simulator was collected during the charity marathon "Don't get tired of doing good" which was held in Melikhov on July 15 on Chekhov's Remembrance Day.
On the eve of the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino in the Chekhov district: "I do not see the eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I would love to get a treadmill as a gift so that my legs would be strong and I would learn to walk a little bit."
And now Sasha's dream has come true!
After the presentation in the museum-reserve will be "Concert-postscript" - a well-known pianist, honored artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform a medley of popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhov, the choir of the Ascension Davydova Desert, the ringers of Ilya Drozdikhin's studio, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy of Gnesin, the artists of the Melikhov Theatre "Chekhov Studio" performed.
Auctions were held for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenirs with the marathon logo were organized.
The Museum-Reserve "Melichovo" has taken the initiative to make Chekhov's Remembrance Day on July 15 a single day of charity in all the museum near Moscow.
A 30-year-old resident of the Olevsk region of the Jitomir region near the local football stadium fired several shots in the direction of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, FACTAM reported in the communications department of the police in the region.
The man then entered a nearby cafe.
In the building, he had a conflict, during which the man used a device to shoot rubber bullets, injuring one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim received the necessary medical treatment and his life was not in danger.
Police and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled.
Law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He had his rubber bullet device seized and sent for examination.
Criminal proceedings under Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have been initiated on this fact.
The detainee faces imprisonment for 3 to 7 years.
Recall, in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya Street on the night of July 28 there was an attack with gunfire.
Michelle Carter's sentencing for reports that prompted Conrad Roy's suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for using text messages and phone calls to incite the suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will have to serve 15 months behind bars and another five years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father told the hearing on Thursday: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain at large pending an appeal.
She faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the verdict standing, clenching her arms and lowering his eyes.
"She killed Conrad Roy by her actions," the prosecutor told the court.
She interrupted his life to improve his.
She pleaded not guilty," she said.
"She showed no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "tragic case that she deeply regrets."
But Judge Lawrence Monis said he believed her "age, maturity level or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions."
The prosecutor read out a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy, which read: "Not a single day has passed when I would not have mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I'm coping - I try to support his sisters despite all the pain that will stay with us forever," it reads.
Roy's sister Kamdin Roy said she was relentlessly haunted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunt.
"To lose a person who has always been with me since I was born is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case is likely to set a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that would provide for the responsibility of advising a person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The case caught the attention of the entire country when it became known that he was pushed to commit suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death while he was vacationing with his family.
Minutes before the suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and forbade her from talking to the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
Lawyers' opinions on this issue were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British flatmate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
Knox, 30, posted a dissenting opinion in the Los Angeles Times, saying, "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a high-flying bird"
One of the best basketball players of VTB United League 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNICS.
Evgeny Bogachev, the president of UNICS, commented on the departure of the American defender izvestia.
Keith made this decision for family reasons, - said Evgeny Bogachev.
He has a young child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different attitude.
He played three seasons at UNICS and showed a high level in each match, gave 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played for the Kazan club for three years, winning silver at united League 2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he received the award for the most productive player of the Euroleague season.
He averaged 21.75 points per game.
This result is the second since 2004, when this award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to win the prize more than once.
Langford will sign a contract with China's Shenzhen in the near future, Eurohoops informs.
The American is expected to sign a two-year, $5 million contract.
Langford will become the second Euroleague star to move to the Chinese championship.
Earlier, former Panathinaikos center Yannis Burusis moved to the Chinese CBA.
Sun-burned tourist from Moscow was evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Adygean rescuers today by helicopter evacuated from the mountainous region of the republic a Moscow tourist who received severe sunburn.
The man was resting in the Fisht shelter, located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased blood pressure and difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis - a serious allergic reaction.
Rescuers were approached by the head of the tour group, who said that the man had suffered burns during the campaign.
Audi to be modified to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW said the company believes there are "more intelligent ways than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - which have considered banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it would modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
Neither company called the move a recall.
European automakers have been actively promoting the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with carbon emissions regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers to install equipment that neutralizes diesel car exhaust is also rising, and maintaining a competitive price for cars is becoming difficult.
While German carmakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of indulging powerful automakers and ignoring signs of a problem.
Companies try not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called "defeat devices" that during testing could correct the amount of harmful gases emitted, so that it complied with the rules, and in normal driving turned off.
Several Volkswagen executives have been convicted in the United States, while others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics department of Audi's engine development team was arrested in Germany.
Former manager, Giovanni Pamo, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and may stand trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emissions rules and widened the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's revenue.
In Astrakhan, a cafe visitor paid with fake money
The police received a report from a bank branch employee about the discovery of a suspicious bill of 5,000 rubles.
A study conducted at the Expert Forensic Centre showed that it was false.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Astrakhan region, one of the visitors of the cafe, who bought a shaurma, paid the banknote.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device to determine the authenticity of the bills.
Currently, the police are identifying persons involved in the manufacture and marketing of a fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Directorate of the Interior Ministry urges residents of Astrakhan region to be careful when carrying out financial transactions; Traders are encouraged to install devices to verify the authenticity of the money they receive.
Astronomers have found a "hell" planet on which even iron can melt
Having first studied the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were quite surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts noted that water molecules are so warmed up by the light of the star that emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Telescope captured the radiance of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but located ten times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, the year on the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "Earth" days, and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and Southern France, but there are now fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has become worse to grow due to dry weather and disease-carrying insects; this has caused a constant headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Erik Shes, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, says: "Lavender in Provence is indeed under threat because in recent years this plant has been affected by climate change: in spring and especially in autumn, there has been much less rain.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
And then there are the little cicadas that jump on the leaves of insects that carry micro-bacteria; There are a lot of them in very dry weather."
There is a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts holidaymakers; lavender oil is very popular in perfumes and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says: "Instead of very long ears with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent ones.
That's why we have fewer parts containing essential oil."
Solutions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding varieties that are more drought-resistant.
Ambassador of winter university-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world champion in hockey, Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 Alexander Semin met the day before with aspiring hockey players and signed autographs to fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 as part of the thematic week dedicated to ice hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could skate on the site with artificial ice.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games with the drawing of souvenir products of student games, warm-up from the aerobics federation were organized.
The event was attended by 50 schoolchildren.
Alexander Semin advised the children to practice as much as possible on sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training - hard work and a great desire to engage in hockey.
"It is great that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a platform as the marquee of the Winter Universiade-2019, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams," the champion said.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter University-2019 help to promote student sport and healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk residents.
The tent of the university will operate throughout the summer season until September 25, according to the press service of the Directorate of the Winter Universiade-2019.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, commenting at the briefing on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said it was necessary to find "areas for cooperation" with Russia.
She said such areas should be found to "improve bilateral cooperation."
Nauert called the truce agreement on Syria an example of such successful cooperation.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the U.S. and Russia should be able to work with each other," the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev's assertion of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said that, of course it has the right to say, but I can't say anything more about it," the State Department spokeswoman said.
Earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that Washington has declared a full-fledged trade war for Moscow, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that U.S. sanctions will be in effect for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes, the American establishment "completely beat" Trump.
Missing in the suburbs bodybuilder found in someone else's cottage lost memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very piquant circumstances: he got out of the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days it was unsuccessfully searched by friends and locals.
And shamil was found in someone else's cottage in Ramensky.
He was completely naked discovered in his toilet by the owner.
The Dagestan athlete could not explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was gone.
The announcements of his disappearance helped to establish his identity.
Paramedics who arrived on the call recorded partial memory loss and traumatic brain injury, Mash reported.
Probably, the athlete is waiting for other surprises.
The intruders who abflicted Shamil may have already visited his apartment, the keys of which were also stolen from him.
Oil and gas revenues of July exceeded forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the revenues received in July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as the agency explains, occurred mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar against the ruble compared to the monthly value of June, used for the assessment, as well as because of the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of exports of petroleum products projected levels.
"The deviation of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate corresponding to the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is projected to amount to 40.2 billion rubles," the Ministry of Finance said in a statement.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic currency market between August 7 and September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of foreign currency purchases will amount to the equivalent of 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in foreign exchange purchase operations by the Russian Ministry of Finance.
Each working day during this period, the Central Bank will conclude foreign exchange purchase deals at organized trading of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The purchased foreign currency will be deposited into the accounts of the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist underscores that it is becoming increasingly dangerous in Mexico.
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodos usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa, linked to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children with them to the office where a grenade was thrown in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no evidence is needed, suspicions and internal feelings will suffice.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected of being in the custody of the government or cartels, a whole list of scoundrels, which make the work of covering the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence does not provide respite, and there are more and more journalists among the corpses that are multiplying in the country: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter - their publisher and mastermind, co-founder of "Riodos" Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violent drug crimes.
His absence is felt very keenly, although his presence is ubiquitous - a large photograph of Valdez showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Building "Riodos"; Two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smile, face in glasses or his signature Panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although in 2010 the office of a special federal prosecutor was organized to investigate journalistic cases, so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two cases have been investigated.
As with most of the thousands of drug-trafficking and organized crime murders each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodos journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are heartbroken, although it is much more dangerous around them now.
Without information about the killers, without justice from talking about security at meetings, it is of little use, Ibarra said.
"It's very foolish to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the cause, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodos office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled from the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name - which means "Twelfth River."
The gunman drove off in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He is survived by his wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually quickly diverge on Culiacan.
But about Valdez almost everyone is silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the U.S. last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in the country as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.
Let's not say that one or more people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-story mausoleums of drug-ships, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Forget for a moment that the state of "calm" is just when one of the cartels takes control of the seaside state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorquez, the 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, is crushed by guilt for not being able to protect a friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the cartel's rival factions that is at war with Guzman's sons, was published in February.
The publication could infuriate the sons; people believed to be gang members bought up all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that wrote about the same story was seized.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been walking away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroest and in 2003, together with five colleagues, founded Riodos, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without dealing with the topic of drugs," Bohorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation as a bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted that in this edition they could read about something that no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodos won the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Award for reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in investigating Mexico's drug trade, wherever it was.
He openly confessed that he was scared.
"I want to move on with my life," he said at the CPJ Awards.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompuyento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist - either like that or you just fool around."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodos staff miss Valdez, a prankster who swore like a loader in the port, a friend generous to hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to get together.
They relied on the order they had in place.
He should always wear his hat.
He had to go to El Guayaba, the bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: was he ruined by the love of one-time routine?
His death also led them to question their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you know their wives, their children, their legal business and underground drug-trafficking airfields.
"These things were over the line," Bohorquez said.
The result, even at the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and the desire for self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says Riodos editor Andres Villarreal, is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and then what happened to Javier happens."
The old rules, he says, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak government institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the employees of "Riodos" gathered for security training, suddenly it was forbidden to bring cell phones: a few days before it became known that spyware, which are sold exclusively to governments, are used in Mexico to spy on journalists and public activists.
Outside, two police officers take shelter in the shade of a tree from the 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were tasked by the state government to guard the Riodos office, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some journalists were half-jokingly asked if the police were among the 50 per cent of the officers on whom the Governor himself had said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area, which is de facto controlled by drug gangs.
In the next issue "Riodos" counted on three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had exposed government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who had been kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant at the same time drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had dominated all levels of government for most of the past century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been charged with high-profile corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when Guzman's son "El Chapo" eluded the military.
Until a few months ago, readers would have been looking for Valdez's column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We would have known what had happened before," said Villarreal, 46, dubbed "El Flaco" for his lean physique.
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources have been severed."
Valdez's office is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers to protest the killings of journalists because employees have become something they never thought they would become: activists acting on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went the next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacan in the west of the country three days after Valdez was killed.
The burned body was found, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists began to speak out louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorquez was in Washington trying to gain international support in demanding justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their killings for telling the truth.
She then asked not to be given more job coverage of government activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdez has said many times that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, its accomplices in the government and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not just drug gangs killed; they do so on the orders of politicians and security services who are in cahoots with organized crime.
The Press Protection Committee ,Artikulo 19 estimates that half of the attacks on journalists last year were ordered by police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
Of course, murder scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elisabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note was found on her body, presumably written on behalf of the zetas cartel: "I am here because of my articles".
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some publications chose to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent Miroslava Britch was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on, like "El Magnana" from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels through a front-page editorial entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It's an excruciating decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile and they are still in danger in the streets.
And sometimes they get killed, as is apparently the case with photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance risky decisions on a daily basis.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits he is scared to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for printing, the publishers of "Riodos" were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office and drinking beer when suddenly their phones rang simultaneously.
A series of skirmishes between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Mazatlan left behind, according to confirmed, 19 bodies.
The war continued to flare up, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news on the Riodos website via a mobile phone.
The next day we had to redo the first page.
Nearby sirens erupted - another firefight in the vicinity.
Bohorquez looked ready for the defense of the police officers guarding them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was on display throughout Sinaloa, the Riodos staff continued his case.
"How can you think about closing," Bohorquez said, "if on the very day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her outside to do a report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it seems to be a statue, though terrifying.
Researchers said the first found remains of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner have survived so well that experts have named it the "Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his scaly skin was reddish-brown - and to say that he had, in a way, a "dark past."
The report, published in the journal Modern Biology, described it as "the best preserved of The time's finds and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
This fossil is a newly found specimen of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good fortune stunned the researchers, who call him "really wonderful."
This herbivorous thyrophor is the best preserved fossil of its kind in the history of the finds, according to articles in the journal National Geographic.
He was found by Sean Funk while working at the Suncor Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the surrounding breed, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was carried out to locate the animal inside an earthen block weighing 2,500 feet (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
"You just have to squint a little bit, and you can almost believe that he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is being showcased.
"He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved specimens of dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
By studying its skin, the researchers found that it was herbivorous, despite the fact that it was covered with a shell and resembled a walking tank, apparently exposed to significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This shell-covered dinosaur used red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective coloring, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow him to merge quickly with the environment and avoid meeting enemies, experts say, suggesting he was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature, a family of nodosaurs, was widely published in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and gave it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum laboratory technician Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours during its painstaking excavation.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the scales and shell plates on his body.
They found a protective coloration, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although protective coloration is well-extended, the discovery came as a surprise because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is much larger than the size of living animals with protective coloration.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred to mask confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective colors - such as deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and are more accessible prey, indicating that nodosaurus had to seriously fight for survival.
"The serious threat from predators to a massive, shell-covered dinosaur shows just how dangerous the Cretaceous Dinosaurs were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in dinosaur scales also suggests that its skin was to be reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about its life, including the preserved contents of its digestive tract, to find out what it ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was carried away into the sea, where it sank and with its back down lay on the bottom of the ocean.
In those days, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to spread much further inland than they do now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, and at the same time is completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked then, in the Early Cretaceous period.
You don't have to use imagination to recreate it, you just have to squint a little, and you can almost believe that he's asleep."
The Cretaceous period is an era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, the tyrophor could be hunted by someone from his formidable ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5-meter) monster weighing six tons.
The scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was carried away at sea after his death and mummified in the ila.
The creature was found by Sean Funk while he was working at the Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, March 21, 2011.
According to the museum staff, it is the best preserved tyreophore in the world, along with the skin and shell, and it is intact, from the muzzle to the femurs.
On average, these creatures were approximately 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was the twenty-20m thorns protruding from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous thyrophorus was hard to walk on what is now Canada, until the spilled river took it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur has preserved its shell with precision to the smallest detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy shell plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michel Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of preservation is "rare as winning a lottery."
The longer I look at him, the more striking he seems.
Fossilized skin residues still cover the bumpy shell plates that dot the animal's skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it are wrapped up.
I can count the scales on his sole."
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikheil Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did so without documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
Saakashvili's arrival was reported by the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his speech on his YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event to mark the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's forces in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he tried to start speaking in this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched on the topic of Georgia's cooperation with Poland, as well as talked about Ukraine.
The disgraced politician learned that the migration service of Ukraine had deprived him of his citizenship while in the United States.
It is not yet known exactly how he managed to make the transatlantic flight without documents.
Earlier, the former governor of Odessa region Mikheil Saakashvili said that his signature on the questionnaire to obtain Ukrainian citizenship was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The term of the investigation in the case of Weinzicher and Olkhovik has been extended until January
The preliminary investigation into the case of Evgeny Olkhovik, co-owner of the Renova Group and the head of the energy holding "T Plus" Boris Weinzicher has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmanny Court is considering the issue of extending the house arrest of the accused.
The representative of the SC at the meeting announced the decision to extend the preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and examine a large number of documents, as well as conduct investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly paid bribes to Comey's leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinzicher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of Complex Energy Systems Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed vimpelcom, handed over bribes to top officials of the Republic of Comey for setting the most favorable tariffs for thermal and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Weinzicher and Olkhovik were detained, taken to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped from the investigation and was put on the federal wanted list.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the core.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, the St. Louis native was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, browsing through a Facebook feed on her phone.
She came across someone from high school.
It said: "Police just killed an 18-year-old child and he's still in the middle of the street."
Noting that no one else in her feed posted this information, puzzled, she closed Facebook and started tweeting.
There were a lot of user reposts with the nickname @TheePharoah in her feed.
The Rapper from Greater St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's lifeless body, spread out in the middle of the street, where it will stay for four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put the phone down, and later that evening she returned to tweets saying people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of the signal tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a placard that read, "A Ferguson police officer just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched the live broadcast as a police officer stands in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, she said, pulled the trigger of a rifle and yelled, "I'm going to kill you all... Animals!"
"It's an unconventional situation," Ferrell said at the time.
"This is not a murder like the ones we are used to and which we can call typical.
At that moment I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
She took a return flight and flew home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next nearly three years was the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," which will be released on August 11.
It's a story about survival and protest, about love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell was traveling to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a floral dress and a wreath to color, they recalled a conversation they had had until this morning, "about the experience of black-skinned people and their situation."
She recalls saying, "Remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson now because a police officer killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't help but take it," Ferrell said later.
"What is happening today is the culmination of what has happened before.
She should know about it, see it and be brought up on it.
It must not only be well versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black-skinned experience and their position and what we must do to become free to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she herself does not personally encounter obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would do her a disservice if I took her away from it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stop they made was on South Florissant Road, a site across the street from the police station that became something of a tent camp, while activists waited for reports of Officer Darren Wilson's final innocence.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined a local businessman who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to protesters.
Little by little, In Ferrell's mind, a new type of activism was shaped.
"My activism has changed completely since August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Nursing Students, Minorities, and dealt with food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
"I had no experience of the organizer.
It came by itself."
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Folauan, one of her co-directors.
Folau said she and her chief cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farre, "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrell came up with the question, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?"
This scepticism was inspired by numerous people, often white people, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and resilience.
As Folau explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson don't get into the spotlight, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folauan had already teamed up with his co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row.
His involvement prompted sympathy for the project from Ferrell and six other locals with whom the "Whose Streets?" team kept in touch during the years since Brown's murder.
"In this documentary, it's not someone talking for us or us, we're talking about it," Davis said.
"It was the most important thing for me how these people will be represented, because that's how I'm going to be represented."
And while the goal of the project was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about the savior leader, but about how the community is coming together," as Folau said - it was the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" shows unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said, laughing as she first saw the finished product.
"But I knew that when you do this kind of work and humanize black people, there has to be some level of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story again discusses and emphasizes the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader context of the "Black Lives Matter" movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - those who created the tag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin - identify themselves as homosexuals.
"Black gay women in leadership positions support this whole movement," Ferrell said. "And that's because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden."
Folauyan agreed, noting that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of gay black women."
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination" and that Ferrell was not chosen as the film's central character because of its distinctive features.
"She was the person who awakened that energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it is no coincidence that she found herself in the foreground, because when "
You can feel its energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, There are no movie camera in Ferguson for a long time, but there are still complex racial links between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on probation for blocking the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of what she calls home simply: "Bardak."
She's still holding on to the speech she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Two Salvadoran football players disqualified for biting U.S. players
Salvadoran national team players Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received lengthy disqualifications for unsportsmanlike conduct.
During the quarterfinal match of the Gold Cup of the Confederations Of North and Central American and Caribbean Football (CONCACAF), Salvadorans bit American players.
Defender Henry Romero was the first to excel.
The Salvadoran bit the attacker Jozy Altidore, and then pinched him on the chest.
Then midfielder Seren bit U.S. defenseman Omar Gonzalez while serving a corner in the penalty area.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Seren for six.
The meeting itself ended with a 2-0 victory for the Americans, Goal.com reports.
Similarities: The artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the hall at the Friedman Gallery in New York, people's faces hang from the ceiling on the wire - white, black and brown, all somehow elusively similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harging from swabs from the cheek and hair trims sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the cuts from Fort Levenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for famously sending confidential diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on August 2, is 10 per.50.
It's the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey Harbor, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and a famous dissident, whom Barack Obama commuted just three days before the end of his presidency.
After analyzing Manning's computer-generated DNA program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of faces that could be in people with such a genome, Dewey-Harging created a deep, though difficult-to-perceive manifesto, dedicated not only to the plasticity of DNA data - the different ways of interpreting them and the inerent determinism of these interpretations - but also the perception of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward but has been outspoken since her teens, said she considers herself a woman, was sentenced in 2013 to 20 counts, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in prison were unavailable, so only one photo of her was known: a grainy black-and-white selfie in which Manning, in a platinum-hued wig, clearly feeling uncomfortable, was sitting behind the wheel of a car; she was associated with this photograph.
In 2015, Dewey Harbor successfully completed its 2012 project Visions of Strangers.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, singling out DNA from the debris and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a preview of the new press exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea was not allowed to visit or take pictures, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait made from her DNA.
In such an unusual way, the artist and her prison-sitting muse became pen pals and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book, "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which depicted how in the future the president would commute Chelsea's punishment and be able to attend the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just days after the book was published was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something profound and powerful about the fact that the exhibition is opening right now that Donald Trump is declaring war on people who disclose classified information in government and inventing new ways to incite twitter the animosity he's meant to mitigate.
When Dewey Harbor was asked about the coincidence of this whole in time, she said that "accidentally nothing happens."
In a statement from the artist, written on the wall of the gallery, Manning's huge signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of a point over the "i" in her surname) calls for an end to "automatic division based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar made of pencil C, G and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist scientifically puts it), Dewey-Harug hoped to show how amazingly similar we all are, at least in their biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome doesn't define what we are, how open the genetic data is to interpretation, and how subjective it is," Dewey-Harug said. her 2007 video work "False Memories" is also on display here.
"These DNA can tell us so many different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition, which was possible in one room, is the above-mentioned novel in the comics.
On it, Manning in the style of King Kong appears above the building of the Correctional Barracks of the United States with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it reads.
"So never shut up."
"It's a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me," says the artist, who greets us from Philadelphia.
"I still have goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as it was visionaryly depicted in the comics - but when she comes, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacrums gathered like crowds of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, as well as all in the exhibition up to the height (5"2, manning's height), on which the genetic haplogroups were drawn with a pencil.
"I used to hang them on the walls, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people," Dewey-Hargg says of the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea as a movement that stood behind its liberation."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted by police on murder charges
Police say a nationwide manhunt is underway against a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who is being sought as suspects in connection with a man stabbed to death in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to Cook County Court records, warrants were issued Monday for premeditated manslaughter without bail of forty-two-year-old Windham Latham and 56-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the deaths of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after suffering multiple stab wounds.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was found July 27.
The police received a call, they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
Officials said Cornell-Duranlo was pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are now investigating the stabbing death as a homicide while police are strenuously searching for two suspects.
Latham has served as Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, the university's vice president of communications, said in an emailed statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was barred from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal case that is being investigated by commissioners and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation," Kabbaj said.
Warren is a senior fellow in finance at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have communicated with UK police and are prepared to provide any necessary assistance to U.S. investigators."
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to surrender.
Chicago Police Department Communications Chief Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly advises suspects to surrender to authorities.
"The police have any assumptions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in Room 1008.
Police described the crime scene as horrific.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
He said CCTV footage confirmed that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza officials issued an appeal to the guests, saying: "Police are currently working on a timeline of the incident, gathering information about the victim and looking into a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA roadmap in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said the world Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) conditions set for the reopening of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be met soon.
"A certain stage in compliance has been passed, RUSADA has received the right to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA roadmap has been updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of wada's roadmap for restoring compliance with the Code, which lists the terms of RUSADA's reopening and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be fulfilled.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the requirements on the list implies that Russian andi-doping agencies must publicly acknowledge the results of an investigation commissioned by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sport was controlled by the state.
Referring to this issue, Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what did not happen."
Mutko echoed the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian newspaper Rsport later that day, Smirnov acknowledged the problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and positions.
No one is going to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 following a doping scandal.
However, in June this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization's Moscow office in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to rebuild its work.
Fire extinguished in 79-storey tower in Dubai
A large fire that occurred in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch Tower, has been extinguished, Reuters reports.
It is noted that firefighters managed to cope with all fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 GMT).
Local authorities said no one was injured in the incident.
At the time of extinguishing the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were blocked.
The cause of the incident is not yet known.
Earlier it was reported that dubai is burning 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world.
All the tenants were evacuated in time.
Buzova's unimaginable outfit shocked fans: trousers that don't cover underpants
Scandalous presenter of the reality show "House-2" Olga Buzova impressed the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival by dancing in her underpants.
In front of thousands of fans, the new singer performed the song "We will be hot" with Nastya Kudri.
Both girls took to the stage in provocative "pants" sewn in such a way that the singers' underwear appeared in plain sight.
Buzova and Kudry were on the trousers.
Earlier it was reported how the changes in Buzova's appearance were commented by a specialist of one of the Moscow plastic surgery clinics.
Stoltenberg admits deterioration in NATO-Russia relations
This was announced on Friday, August 4, the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, nato Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and "destabilization in eastern Ukraine."
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia is nevertheless possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said relations between the U.S. and Russia are at dangerously low levels, and blamed the U.S. Congress.
Ekaterinburg Metro adopts a new way of paying
In October, travel in the Ekaterinburg metro will be able to be paid with a bank card, said Pavel Vedernikov, CEO of I-Net, in an interview with the Regional Newspaper.
Our goal is to introduce the same subway fare system for the 2018 World Cup as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the uniform, to be able to use the subway with their bank cards, without buying tokens and not standing in line," he said.
Startups to help your company not become the next "Uber"
Aimee Errett wanted to gauge the level of satisfaction among her startup's e-commerce employees, but the surveys didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"He's never been consistent or objective," said Errett, who runs a San Francisco-based 75-person company, Madison Reed, an e-commerce company focused on hair care.
So she turned to third parties for help.
Now there is a new kind of startups in the field of work with personnel, which help companies to find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to do rapid surveys, access certain teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass top management and contact the directorate directly.
"Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor your health, and where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City-based startup Glynd, whose analytics programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she has gained a better understanding of what her employees think and feel in the three years she has used "Glint."
In addition to the express surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a thermal card of the company and shows in a visual form which departments have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies gradually realize that they need to control the workplace environment, otherwise they will become the next Uber, which was implicated in the scandal, when a former employee published a blog post in which he described an aggressive environment in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for profitable business.
The "Let's Talk About Payment" website, which is dedicated to financial technology, estimates that the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The Start-up Convercent, based in Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid a decline in Uber's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently appeared among its customers.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized staff opinion surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous text message hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the directorate.
"The court of public opinion has seized power from the inspectors," said Patrick Kwinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company mistreats employees or behaves unethically, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company could face costly consequences in the form of customer boycotts, employee outflows and lawsuits, mr. Kwinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, has been using Convercent for more than a year to make sure employees are up to date with the rules and procedures, and to offer an easy way to contact the company's head office.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to search for a phone number or head office email, file a formal complaint and hope that she would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and embarrassing experience, said James Vitrano, chief legal officer at Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses the "Convercent" service, problems that used to be hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay - can be quickly discovered and addressed.
"I can come close to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the employee situation," said Vitrano, who directs the Network's "Ruby Tuesday" risk management team.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
According to Mr. Kwinland, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron case.
But it was only when "social networks became widespread", that companies realized that they could not keep their dirty laundry from viral distribution on the net.
"Before we started using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that has received the approval of venture capitalists who have supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the total capital to $60 million.
This investment is hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they did before.
In markets with fierce competition, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just a necessary minimum.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they devote their time to companies with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work for a company, feel they're being heard, and that the work they're doing is working harder, they're more trying to make it a success," said Nina McKuin, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when companies in their portfolios are doing well; companies do well when employees are dedicated and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to workplace culture experts, it is important to have data on employee engagement.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can give the impression that change is coming.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or does not occur at all, there may be disappointment, and employees will lose interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 offers, you have to be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Rath, president of consulting at management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies make mistakes by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't go all the way, the staff will be like, "Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports a problem with "Glint."
And, after collecting feedback from employees dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is learning about its employees and hopes that in the long run, this knowledge will help it better retain employees in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose company.
New asphalt on Krasnoarmey Avenue is opened in Barnaul
In Barnaul took drastic measures to eliminate the cause of asphalt failures on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue.
The place where the pits appeared twice on the newly paved roadway (intersection with Youth Street) was decided to "open".
Recall, the collapse of a small section of the road near the tram tracks was due to the fact that the ground sank in the area of the unowned unoperated network.
According to Ivan Garmat, deputy chairman of the city's committee on road, landscaping, transport and communications, a detailed survey will be carried out for detailed examination and elimination of the preconditions for the collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that the repair of the formwork of homeless communications and their concrete will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
Bruins team has to practice longer because the National Student Athletic Association cancels workouts twice a day
The time is approaching eleven o'clock in the evening; A crowd of football players from UCLA is delayed to chat on one side of the team's new training fields located on campus.
Some of them pulled off their T-shirts, baring their backs, glistening from sweat after a tense first day of sports camp.
For many of the team's players, these minutes of idleness make up a mid-afternoon break.
Players enrolled in summer classes will head back to the dormitories after a three-hour training session to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning they will return to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 a.m.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said, "These guys are going to have a meat grinder for the next three days."
The fact that the National Student Athletic Association canceled workouts twice a day, which was designed to reduce the workload for players, actually lengthened their workday - at least until after the exams on Friday.
That's why the start of the first three training sessions of the UCLA team was scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to fit into an already tight schedule of players.
A side effect of not having two workouts a day has been more days with one workout, and the Bruins are moving the start of camp by nearly a week compared to last year and holding summer school workouts for the first time in Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to conduct 18 training sessions until August 20, before starting formal preparations for the first game of the season against the University of Texas team in September.
Mora said he supports a rule change by the National Student Athletic Association, even though he has another point in the players' tight schedule.
"In three or four days we give them this huge load, it's a serious test," Mora said.
'And they just overcame it, they work, they're great guys.
I think when we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great."
When camp ends, UCLA will make workouts closed; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct sight from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs that overcame the safety net behind the gate.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are available during the season, there may be a problem.
"We will have security," Mora said.
"This is a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger by suggesting that someone can rent a room, sit there and record the training on video.
If you have a video of the workout, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and security in parking number 8.
We're going to do everything we can with what we have.
I'm not going to worry too much about that.
We have a plan."
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg have been discharged from hospitals
All those injured in the terrorist attack in the St. Petersburg metro in April have been discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of Deputy Governor Anna Mityanina.
As of the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, TV Center reports.
Recall, the explosion in the St. Petersburg metro occurred on April 3 this year.
The bomb was detonated by suicide bomber Akbarzhon Dzhalilov.
Fifteen people were killed in the attack, as well as the perpetrator himself.
Eleven people, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, have been arrested in the criminal case.
Recall, on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended the St. Petersburg Metro to review the plan of measures to ensure transport security, in particular, increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook steps up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook will be more likely to send hoax-suspicious texts to independent experts and show their conclusions under original posts, the world's largest social network, which is trying to combat so-called fake news, said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company said it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible hoaxes, send them to the test, and possibly show fact-checking results under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false messages ahead of the presidential election in May, and in Germany, before the September elections, they announced support for a plan to fine social media if they did not promptly remove hate posts.
In a separate statement in German on Thursday, Facebook announced testing of a new fact-checking algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which posts are challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and share," Sarah Sue, Facebook's news feed manager, wrote in the block.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the "linked articles" feature and work on other changes to the news feed to address the problem of fake news.
Create a comic novel: One castle in English history
In the recent past, the tiny Castle of Scotney was filmed in the music video "Squeeze" and in the 70s and 80s served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the River Beul Valley in Kent, he oversaw the tumultuous history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a smoky hair and a penchant for historical documents, to a novel-comic.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says enthusiastically.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
"Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Eurardian era and tells the story of the families who lived in Scotney; Each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Bryony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book, which is based on archival data: in 2014 he wrote "Dead Man's Teeth and Other Stories" - a collection of documents from the British Library; this project suddenly touched him to the core.
"I could have been touched by a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites," he says.
"It's his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those days a fire was lit for lighting.
And 300 years from now, you feel like you're there, too.
Oh, how much I love archives!"
For a man gripped by such a passion for old papers, getting support from the National Trust and the English Art Council and living in a castle for four months ("Honestly, I'm a little stoned there") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days studying the "new" Victorian castle, going through the archives and examining the estate's many treasures and antiques - such as hyena heads on the walls or bottles that had been in the moat for centuries.
He walked through the park and through the ruins of the old castle, talking to foresters, gardeners and sometimes artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
Then at night he "drinked whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scotney Castle is not well understood, because the National Trust only gained full access to it in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the staff were just beginning to deal with the archive, which he describes as "what aristocrats have been dumped in the attic for centuries."
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You think land disputes are boring," Rhodes says, "but two families fought for this birch tree.
That's what happens, guys!"
In some of the collection's stories, the castle becomes the starting point for broader explorations in English history: for example, in "The Worker," the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
"There is evidence of a riot that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called The Knight Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
"The peasant uprising started in these places, and I thought that the revolt was a good beginning.
Maybe they were related?"
Other plots are strongly related to the history of the castle - for example, "The Priest", which tells the story of a Jesuit priest, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "The Smuggler," about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by stuffing the coffin with stones (this was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
Darrells is Rhodes' favorite family of all that the Scotsmen inhabited: "The gentlemen seem to have been a perfect rogue, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy older women - I imagine them as a group of nice guys who can look after heiress of big fortunes."
After finishing his work at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elyammyaki - the place where in the early 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it was again overgrown with forest.
But Scotney remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt something like this: hell, I have to go back to real life."
Fifteen largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and Opening FC, seven more credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the organizations that have left the ARB will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just an option - all the banks, which announced the break with the ARB, are negotiating with another public organization uniting credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia", headed by a well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, by the way, at the end of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma committee and deputy on the number of drafted bills.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was initiated during a discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, suggesting a new classification of banks depending on the size of the share capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, president of the ARB, said that, in the opinion of the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which thus try to limit the opportunities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims there was also criticism against the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, is not always justified in revoking licenses from some banks, which, however, was opposed by the representative of the Central Bank: many heads of fined banks, in particular, Vneshprombank, were members of the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, stating their disagreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare for joining the association "Russia", noting that "the effectiveness of the ARB's work will be low, and constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually conducted."
Investors will be better off
How will it end?
We will answer immediately the main question, which arises at the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sector or next to it: depositors are not threatened, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Anatoly Aksakov, known for his meticulousness in everything concerning the interests of banks and their clients, is headed by "Russia" and is highly regarded by the Central Bank: almost all the central bank's management is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through the expert assessments of "regionals".
In terms of personnel and organizational terms, it is obvious that there will also be no particular upheaval.
Undoubtedly, the ARB finds itself in a difficult financial and managerial situation after it loses such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, in this oldest - established in 1991 - an organization that advocates the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the field of monetary circulation in general.
It cannot be said that the association "Russia" with open arms are ready to accept new members on any terms, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe they will want too much"), who on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "literally the next day representatives of the banks leaving the ARB asked me to consider the possibility to increase the potential of our association "Russia".
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Council of the Association, as well as pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Now the negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the international banking forum, is being prepared.
That's where we'll decide.
Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that he "doesn't hold for the chair", called Georgi Luntovsky, the new head of the updated association "Russia" georgi Luntovsky, who is leaving the post of deputy chairman of the Central Bank in September, highly describing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently vacationing in Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association "Russia" where he is scheduled to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress of "Russia."
Entry of petrol-powered cars to major Russian cities will not be restricted
Deputy head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with gasoline engine into major cities of Russia will not be restricted.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually raise the environmental class.
And there the concept immediately switch to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for that.
The question is: from what year?
It's a phrase at the level of slogans - let's ban it.
Where and when?
tomorrow?
Are we going to close the whole town?
"In 20 years- I don't know, maybe it will happen," Prime quotes the minister as saying.
Earlier, Izvestia newspaper reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was tasked with studying proposals on possible options for state support for electric transport, presented to the government by the director general of Kamaz, Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, - the use of cars with DVS in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for obtaining a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump said that a new U.S. immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will be changed.
The plan calls for reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in two houses of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing the way the U.S. gives green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who speak English, have the money resources that allow them to support themselves, and have skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said, according to US media.
The advent of sex robots is real, and that should worry us
Before we could think that 2017 could not get worse, a new report on technological successes in the production of sex robots has come out.
Yes.
Sex robots are in the spotlight right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the eye color of robots, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about it, but firms are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and we'll see a lot more of them soon," Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts into robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas, which are controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "tune" their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality" compared to which Stepford's Wife would seem very progressive, worries even more.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to customize in robots qualities that they find attractive - for example, shyness.
There are still Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by "True Companion" that come with an already programmed personality - for example, "Cold Farrah" gives the impression of being shy, while "Wild Wendy" has a "bold" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits perfectly with yours," the True Companion website enthusiastically reports.
So she loves what you love, doesn't like what you don't like, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may "be in the mood"!"
In the appearance of sex robots, much is troubling - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the most disturbing image of a woman, an association with rape, is caused by the mastery of Cold (read: resisting) Farah.
On the website "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) maybe a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" the website says.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a deviation from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with submission as an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they still remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not bad or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots came at a time when women's rights around the world were under threat, when the White House has a president who boasts about molesting women.
The worst thing about the TV series "The Handmaid's Tale" - not graphic images, twisted bodies and squeezed eyes, namely, how this vision seems realistic.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem so big now.
The aim of the sex robot industry is to achieve such physical similarity to real women (only with the proportions of stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to seem like people to the touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is their "characters" robots do not look like real women.
They cannot break up with their partners or leave them.
They have neither their own life nor biography - nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, - maids.
Los Angeles-born Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who has been playing for Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
Andrey Lebedev, general manager of the Blue-Yellows, said this in an interview with BeBasket.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately he won't come for family reasons.
We will go to Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we do not want to take someone we do not know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
Let me remind you: with jet's direct participation, the National Team of Ukraine took a record sixth place at Eurobasket 2013 and for the first time got to the World Basketball Championship, where the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the native of the United States scored an average of 15.4 points per game, made 3 rebounds and gave 5 assists.
Jeter has stopped playing for the Ukrainian national team since the resignation of the head coach of our national team American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
The men's Eurobasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will play its matches of the group tournament on the Promised Land.
Evgeny Murzin's team will have five matches in Group B: against Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two control matches, in which they lost to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
Pretending to be Mitt Romney seems very reasonable
In the age of Trump, the common ground was the fact that the political debates that polarized the American electorate had micro-broken some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers have been full of columns on how to deal with horrific relatives voting for Trump.
I think we're all tense, we're going to burst.
Less is said about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet from Chicago who's been on knives with Republicans in her family for a long time, came to visit me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting in the fight against a common enemy can have a strong effect.
Under Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother with whom she has been arguing about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely found themselves on the same side.
At dinner it is undoubtedly good; but I can't help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed strength into the left flank, but the distorting effect of his rule could shift us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop being struck by his antics.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans, who, against his standards, will suddenly seem to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself missing Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness today - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looks like) - compared to Trump and both seem very little evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican nominee will just have to be in his mind to see him as a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids on a merry-go-round in Central Park - the biggest merry-go-round in the New York Parks Department farm and the best way in town to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
Horses are menacing and huge, the pictures of fiberglass on the central drum - grimacing clowns and animals, which, bent, looking at their backs in horror - are extremely ominous, and the ringing music, strangely enough, leads to delight.
So many famous things in this city disappoint: the views from skyscrapers are outdated, the silhouettes of buildings are too busy to cause trepidation, and the reality of the city does not keep up with the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still going through the day when I found out that Suisse Cottage is not really a Swiss chalet (the themed pub "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" doesn't count), but a large roundabout in North London.
A merry-go-round in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place in which a child of two years, a child of eleven years and two women in their forties can have a great time.
If I could put a carousel score, I'd put a fiver, but luckily no one asked me to.
And in the department store this week I was asked before holding a card on the terminal, to evaluate my "experience" of shopping on a scale of one to five stars.
In a coffee shop on the corner of my street all the same plus the option to accompany the estimate with a tip of 15 percent - it's for order at the counter.
As a result, not only does the interaction be slowed down by the neutral interaction, but also that it is necessary to bring a personal attitude to a situation that does not involve it.
The poor saleswoman in the department store smiled confusedly as I tiredly assessed my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pains
Pistorius leaves prison because of a visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which the prison authorities allege he suffered as a result of a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder after an appeal by prosecutors for the original sentence for manslaughter.
He killed Steinkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the bathroom door of his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he mistook his girlfriend for a night thief hiding in his toilet.
The prosecutor's office said it would lodge another protest, this time against Pretorius's six-year term, which she said was too soft.
The Attorney-General's Office has said it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal will be heard this year.
Pretorius's term could be extended by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect in beating of NTV journalist elected subscription not to leave
The capital's law enforcement officers have chosen a measure of restraint in the form of a subscription not to leave for the man who attacked NTV journalist Nikita Razvozhaev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Russian Interior Ministry Irina Volk.
"As part of the investigation of the criminal case initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Battering") against a 32-year-old man who hit the face of a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation named Gorky, the suspect was elected a measure of restraint in the form of a subscription not to leave and proper behavior," Volk said.
The interior ministry spokeswoman added that an administrative protocol had been drawn up against the suspect for disobedience to the police.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast to the Day of the Airborne, a drunken man approached the reporter and punched him in the face.
As it turned out later, the bully has nothing to do with the Airborne Forces.
According to Razvozhaev himself, paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian citizens detained in Greece for illegal camping
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people who set up tents in the wrong place, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained in Sitynia.
They were released on the same day while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the BBC that Bulgarian citizens were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and have already imposed serious fines on anyone caught parking in an unengrounded location.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court can impose a fine.
Russian Foreign Ministry accuses US vice president of Cold War rhetoric
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence were criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
"It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly sliding deeper into the primitive ideological stamps of the Cold War, which are completely detached from reality," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
This is how the Foreign Ministry reacted to Pence's words about the "Russian threat" and attempts to forcibly redraw the borders he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "either with the West or with Russia" and the non-obviousness of the thesis about the supposedly non-alternative accession of the whole of South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to alienate Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We call on our American colleagues to stop slandering Russia and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Paramedic injured in accident with ambulance in Moscow suburbs
The accident occurred in the suburbs of Stupino, as a result of a collision between a foreign car and an ambulance, a paramedic was injured.
Today at about 08:10 Moscow time there was a collision of a Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in the city of Stupino in the Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance overturned," the press service of the Interior Ministry's Moscow Region police department told TASS.
Law enforcement officers are working at the scene of the accident, the circumstances of the incident are being investigated.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son at a construction site, wrapped in a plastic bag.
On the evening of August 3, the Separation Police Department received a report from a local resident that he had found a package with an infant in an unfinished private house.
"Law enforcement officers and doctors went to the scene and promptly took the child to a medical facility," the Odessa head of the National Police said.
Medics determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical cord.
A 36-year-old local woman has been identified as a woman who gave birth in the course of the first operational and investigative measures.
It has also been established that the woman has three other young children.
As noted in the chapter, the family had not previously come to the attention of law enforcement officers and was not on special register.
The police are currently investigating the circumstances and reasons that forced the woman to do so, after which a procedural decision will be made.
Now the baby is under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev a 21-year-old woman threw her premature baby in a garbage can.
Gregory Leps: "I'm eager to fight, although 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage Grigory Leps will celebrate his 55th birthday next Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer talked to the Izvestia columnist.
I remember your half-time.
A special marquee in Luzhniki, Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You must have been pretending to spend your next five years.
Have the plans come true?
If we talk about the profession, it was a good period.
I worked hard, toured the whole country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He has released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not the same now as, say, 20 years ago.
Biological clocks do not cheat.
Singing the way I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
Nevertheless, I'm eager to fight, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think, go to a different level.
With them you and a new album record, the first in three years.
Yes, work is underway on it now.
Actually, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we're going to send it to L.A. for a mix.5 million.
It is called "What are you so serious?" based on the song of the same name, which was written together with Timati.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put it anywhere yet.
We'll do it later, when we'll shoot the clip for it.
And we will present the album in November - to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
Your new record was a nice american drummer, Chris Coleman.
Do you seem to want to bring him to your touring line-up?
In my opinion, Coleman today is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world.
He came to my studio, recorded his parts.
I invited him to join my band, and Jeremy Coulson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects. - "Izvestia") offered.
But for long work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It was about royalties from 35 thousand to 45 thousand per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I will find worthy musicians.
And I found a great drummer Max Malyshev.
In general, it is better to feed their own (smiles).
Sometimes I want to find fault with one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fyodor Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
Western music magazines write about it, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Vai, listening to his play, said that "a new generation of guitarists has come, with a different performing technique."
Your album comes down to Los Angeles, American musicians are collaborating with you, but you still can't come to the U.S.?
Are you trying to lift this ban?
Now, frankly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers who are dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I really sincerely wish I could get to America.
I've said many times that I'm studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that kind of school experience.
For 70 years our artists of popular music have not been given the tasks that American musicians have always solved.
They wanted to sound as high-quality as possible.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now for some reason the UK has refused my entry for ten years.
But I will still apply for a visa every year to the British Embassy, so that I will be allowed to go there again and most importantly - to work there.
The rest of Europe is sympathetic to me.
And in August you are planning a concert in Monaco, not custom-made, but a poster, right?
Yes, there is a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo, and I've performed there once.
Now we have been invited again, and as far as I know, all tickets for the concert have already been sold out.
Will you go to the "Lyma Vaikula' Randeva, which starts on July 20 in Jurmala?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lima is a wonderful singer and a gorgeous woman who knows how to present herself and beautiful vocals, and even whispers.
After touring and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you once again want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third one come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done in a completely different way.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky in about the same pitch as he did himself.
Just the voice and the guitar.
No other arrangement.
Our famous musician Timur Vedernikov will accompany me.
I will try to involve Alexander Rosenbaum as a part of the album.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so we'll see how it goes.
You and Boris Grebenshchikov's songs gradually introduced into your repertoire.
Why don't you write down an album of his things?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I crossed paths with him several times and asked: can I sing this or that song?
He said, "Grigory, I write songs to make them sing."
Please try, sing.
Probably, it is interesting to record such an album.
I don't have such a task yet, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't object, I may do such a project.
If you don't focus entirely on the affairs of your production center.
I guess until you realize his potential, haven't you signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers that I would have dreamed of having under my wing, but they are independent, accomplished people.
Do you mean Sergey Lazarev?
Seryozha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in "The Voice."
We made a contract with him and we are working.
In our pop music such singers are rare.
It would be a shame if he did not reach the heights he deserved.
I'm trying to get his repertoire, I'm shooting clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, pay poets, sometimes their tracks get into the rotations of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On the way out, they will get a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I will be pleased if one of them achieves commercial success and pays me the interest that we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cut off the oxygen to anyone.
Let everyone work, make their way, prove, as I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered to do a tour of Ukraine and guarantee entry to the country, will you go?
I'm still invited there.
Most of these are private events.
And as for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, by his own conviction flew to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that it is necessary to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I will fly.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that we have such a situation with Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people and should be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
And before that I gave 40-50 concerts in Ukraine for a year.
We met like nowhere else.
A very grateful audience.
And with several Ukrainian artists cooperated: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik ...
There are a lot of gifted people in Ukraine, and it is sincerely a pity that now they can not fully splash out their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would love to invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as Slava Vakarchuk, and did a concert with him.
But I think at the moment it is unlikely...
Andrey Otlopkov was transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known to "Y", the technical director of the Cosmodrome Oriental Andrey Otlopkov started work at the State Space Research and Production Center (GKNPC) named Hrunichev.
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Oriental Cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the Center for the Exploitation of Ground and Space Infrastructure (CENKI) was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow Philae, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Oklopkov will not have a replacement: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the functionality is scattered on the CENSKI units.
The fact that the technical director of the Eastern and deputy director general of CENKI for technological development Andrei Otlopkov moved to work in the Hrunichev SCNC was told by the top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
"He has been working in his new post for several weeks," - the interlocutors of "Y" in the industry said.
CENKI could not be reached for comment on Thursday, and Mr. Otlopkov himself was unavailable for comment.
However, the information was officially confirmed by the SCNC.
He made a decision to move to the position of director of production coordination, - said the company. - Andrey Otlopkov set a task to provide a launch minimum for the first launch at the Orient Cosmodrome fully fulfilled.
Mr. Otlopkov joined CENCI in 2013, having served in the space forces, particularly in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk- at the "northern" cosmodrome, he served as the first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Otlopkov became a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly from his filing regional merchants received state orders for kickbacks, but did not fulfill the commitments made to clean up the separate parts of launch vehicles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Comey.
He was found not guilty by a jury in 2012.
The responsibilities assigned to him in CENCY for technological development extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of the cosmodrome in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, the head of the Federal Space Agency, said in an interview with "Yu" that the situation in the East "was critical already in October 2013".
The fact is that a strategic mistake was made in the planning: the completion of construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were planned at the same time - the end of 2015.
To carry out the launch before the end of the year, they decided to complete the construction six months earlier and the deadline was shifted from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process had to go to the trick: CENKI specialists began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment at unfinished facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrey Otlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and still the transfer (instead of December 2015," the Soyuz left only on April 28, 2016), this idea paid off, says the source of "Y" at the cosmodrome: "Otherwise, we would not have carried out a single launch from the East, and would have been engaged in construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Otlopkov his "space Susanin", but it was he who almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction.
I remember Mr. Otlopkov and directness: for example, in an interview with "Y" he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Special Construction) of the status of the sole executor in the East and to work directly with subcontractors: "Why should we put all our eggs in one basket of the Special Forces?"
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has assumed the duties of general contractor to complete construction and installation work at the launch and technical complex by the planned fourth quarter of the start-ups.
According to Yu, the reason for Mr. Otlopkov's transition to a new job was disagreements with the CENKI management on how to complete the construction of facilities and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as methods of working with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be better for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
A government official, for his part, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, it will not be easy to find an equivalent replacement."
According to Yu, this will not be necessary: the position of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be scattered on the CENSKI units.
Music schools will have a program of teaching two specialties
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to Sviatoslav Golubenko, deputy director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture, it is possible to re-read out the repetitive disciplines to students, and the issue of paying for the rest of the classes in the second specialty can be solved with the help of special grants, RIA Novosti reports.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's "Nedet Talk" with pupils of the children's center "Sirius" student Maria Andreeva said that she had to pay for repetitive subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she is studying violin and piano and has awards contests in both directions.
The head of state recognized her question as very relevant and promised to help.
17-year-old Russian arrested on a wall on a skyscraper in Mexico
In Mexico, detained 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who climbed on the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, reports the portal El Universal.
The incident took place in the capital of Mexico City.
With the help of two unidentified men, the young man climbed over a three-meter fence into the property of Nestle's office buildings and climbed one of his towers on his own.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
They detained a young man on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security lowered him to the ground in a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
They find out whether the young man is legally in the country.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man climbing a high-rise has become popular on the web.
Users called the young man a "Spider-Man."
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help ease HCC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies suggest otherwise: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
It is an incurable disease that affects an estimated 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leading to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid of the protein tryptophan promotes the production of immune cells that increase gut tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells in the gut make sure that harmful microbes coming from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance while protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much disturbed in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that mice with a specific bacterium in the gut appear to increase cell tolerance.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of protein - to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan was contained in mice' nutrition, the more of these immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation of the environment in the gut.
Postdoc Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying a type of tolerant immune cells, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, and the other group, which belonged to the same line, but was kept separately, they did not have.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the gut microbiomes of mice - communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
Dna from the mice's gut cells was sequenced, and six types of bacteria were found present in mice with immune cells but absent in mice without them.
Mice grown in a sterile environment, did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, received L. reuteri, and immune cells they appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of fluid - without bacteria - to undived immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of the processing of tryptophan, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells also halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in genes associated with tryptophan have been found in people suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
She says: "Perhaps we need to strengthen the development of these cells, because inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an expansion of their population."
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United have hired a "genius" in the person of Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have hired a "genius" in the person of Nemanja Matic, according to Jose Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, who bought a 40 million pound deal from Chelsea, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in United's last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and impressed as a midfielder, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke ahead whenever they pleased.
However, as Matic did not take part in Chelsea's pre-season tour of Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game and lasted only 45 minutes, which Mourinho said required a pre-season overhaul.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him prepare sooner rather than later."
Like Matic, his fellow new players Victor Lindelef and Romelu Lukaku started the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to form his main line-up by the start of next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but pointed out that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire in the first place.
"I am grateful to the club for having got three out of four," he added.
"I'll be even more happy if they get me four out of four, but they've done a great job for me."
Former leaders of The Social Democrats of Lithuania persuade them to stay in the ruling coalition
Former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former Prime Ministers Algirdas Butkevicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former Speaker of the Sejm from the Social Democrats Cheslovas Yurshenas appealed to the party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the "Parliamentary newspaper", because of friction with partners - the Union of Peasants and Greens - in the Social Democratic Party initiated a discussion on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here three senior experienced comrades addressed to the party members with an open letter, which, in particular, says: "It is clear the disappointment of the party comrades with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the "peasants" has created for us, albeit not very easy, but still conditions for the further implementation of the goals of social justice, which on our initiative are provided in the program of the government and to maintain the political dominance of the centre-left over right-wing parties."
According to former party leaders, in the debate so far "emotional expression of opinion without concrete arguments has prevailed."
The authors of the letter fear that their party's ill-considered actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Disabled Anton Mamayev was fined
The Moscow City Court commuted the sentence of wheelchair user Anton Mamayev from four and a half years in prison to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
Earlier, the convict was released from the detention center by the decision of the Timiryazev court.
At the same time, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, as he organized the robbery and kidnapping of a scooter from a former special forces soldier.
The Moscow City Court reduced the sentence of Anton Mamayev to 200,000 rubles of fine by its decision.
"Mamayev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms a part of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility," - explained "Y" moscow city Court spokeswoman Ulyana Solopova.
In this case, the court took into account Mamayev's state of health, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to impose punishment below the lower limit.
As for Mamayev's assistant Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would be the basis for changing the category of gravity of the crime and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamayev himself said that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I am disappointed with the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse, intending to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrei Orlov did not rule out appealing the verdict to the court of cassation of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights," he told RIA Novosti.
Recall, 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamayev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in the criminal case last fall.
Disabled claims that he bought a scooter from friends for 160,000 rubles to sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, including a former special forces soldier, said that the disabled man and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov took away their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazev District Court in Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in prison, and Anton Mamayev to four and a half years in prison with serving his sentence in a general regime colony (according to Article 2, 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobilized disabled person was placed in the pre-trial detention center, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General's Office, the Commissioner for Human Rights under President Tatyana Moskalkova joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamayev was released from the detention center by the decision of the same Timiryazev court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in the Moscow City Court.
ONF will prepare a report on the environment to the President
The final "Forum of Action" of the All-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told Izvestia and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexey Anisimov.
According to him, after the forum, the "front-runners" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of the domestic ecology, as well as to propose a strategy to solve them.
Izvestia's interlocutors in the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain "deep analysis" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of the ONF will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it adjusts to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally attends key events of the ONF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final will be a conference in the capital of buryatia Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been expressed and will be expressed at these events, we will form systemic proposals to solve environmental problems, - the interlocutor in the ONF told Izvestia.
Olga Timofeeva, co-chair of the Movement's Central Staff, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the "front-line" will report to the head of state on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the ONF Action Forum are likely to be combined.
During the year we have overgrown a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report, which we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "front-line" will report on the work on priority projects of the ONF, - Olga Timofeeva told Izvestia.
According to her, Sergey Ivanov, the special representative of the head of state on environmental, environmental and transport issues, will also be invited to the forum.
Previously, he had already participated in the work of the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms to work for years to come.
That these issues do not fall out of the agenda, - Olga Timofeeva added.
Andrey Kolyadin, head of the regional policy laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), said that by raising environmental issues, the ONF is acting in line with the presidential agenda.
Many of the things they offered as experts at various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the president, - Andrey Kolyadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be excluded today, which could give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the ONF, regions will be able to lobby not only for the solution of their environmental problems, but also with the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The topicality of environmental issues was demonstrated by a "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the landfill in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port city of Nakhodka (already drafted a bill to ban the open transfer of coal in populated areas, one of the authors - Olga Timofeeva).
Environmental experts believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the issue is further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, - says leonid Bochin, head of the charitable foundation "Ecology for All".
Sergey Tsyplenkov, a member of the HRC and head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, told Izvestia that a responsible approach of society and business is needed to successfully solve environmental problems, and legislative efforts alone are not enough.
As soon as the society and business realize that the solution of environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - Sergey Tsyplenkov said.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violation of environmental legislation is an economically profitable solution for business.
British inventor implanted a microchip to get into the house and the car by the wave of his hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so he could open the door of his house, enter the office and even start a car with a simple wave of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and forefait and now, through his firm, BioTech, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal In Winchester, to ensure that the implantation procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to the microchip implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company is also replacing locks in homes and cars with a chip-compatible one at a cost of 300 pounds per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his BMW 4 car, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
Props for the White House costing taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to military records provided to TIME magazine, the White House's decision last month to bring a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event on U.S. industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the "Marine One" when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of a July 17 White House event that showcased U.S. construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and top White House officials have surveyed technology products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was on display next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
According to the First Squadron of Marine Helicopters (HMX-1), the department responsible for helicopter control, the White House Military Administration ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO," just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an "unusual" event.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because this is an unusual, high-profile event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his chief, the First Deputy Chief of Aviation for the Marine Corps, ahead of the event.
The letter stated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 to attend the 3 p.m. event and would remain there until the lawn was vacated between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to return to flight in accordance with the working hours restrictions.
The first crew escorted the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel remained next to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the recordings obtained by TIME magazine whether a second crew was required in the end.
Hatch's law prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event contradicts this ruling.
"Among other things, we asked if this was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told not," the commander wrote.
"It looks like you have nowhere to go," the deputy chief replied.
The "Made in America" event was declared by the White House as an official event, and Hatch's law did not apply to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the president made efforts to advance health care reform, then in the Senate, and touted attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as "Marine One" and "Air Force One" for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to request them only in the interests of photo opportunities is unusual.
Trump was already the subject of debate in February when the president drove through the background during his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was inundated with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the president's plane.
"The White House is thrilled with the "Made in America" screening, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington metropolitan area and on the South Lawn to train the Transportation of the President of the United States to the White House with precision to an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 training camps outside the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight performed for the "Made in America" event was counted by the crew in the required training flights for a month.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 extra hours that day as part of "non-presidential support missions."
According to the White House, taxpayers did not bear the cost of any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesperson said that the company did not participate in the demonstration of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep a budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Defense Department's hourly rate for fiscal year 2017, the Defense Department's reimbursement rate for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit's records stated that the airtime of the aircraft was 30 minutes each way from its airfield at the Marine Corps' Cuantico Air Base in Virginia.
The White House argues that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than this rate.
"It's completely wrong to calculate the cost to taxpayers based on the approximate reimbursement rate," Walters said.
"These approximate rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 study by RAND Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and expenses specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to demonstrate this week things that are done in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I assume, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose workplace depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to create.
So, of course, it is absolutely appropriate to pay attention to it."
It was unclear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter while inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he definitely sat in the driver's seat in the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three."
Moscow to allocate grants for resuscitation departments of city hospitals
Each year, "Saving Lives" grants will be allocated to intensive care units of the capital's medical clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed a thank-you letter to the orthopaedic trauma doctor Victor Protsko, under whose direction the complicated operation was carried out to reconstruct the teenager's foot.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to grant grants to intensive care units and intensive care units of city clinics every year.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is one of the largest in Moscow today.
In recent years, the clinic has received new state-of-the-art equipment, allowing its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomen village hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to the intensive care unit and the hospital, there are day departments.
The hospital employs 2,800 people.
The total area, occupying medical clinics, is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical establishment became a participant in a pilot project for the organization of short-stay hospitals (UPC).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the course of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce the period of rehabilitation of patients.
After the operation in the hospital, they spend only a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients were provided with inpatient medical care at the Yudin Clinical Hospital.
The clinic's medical staff performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of difficulty.
NBU reported the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
This was announced on Friday, August 4, TASS reports, citing a representative of the NBU press service.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Viktor Prokopeni to agree an indirect (via Paritybank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank shares was withdrawn.

On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew an application to buy a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine denied Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov the acquisition of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents to check for their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian law.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian "daughter" to the norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the "daughters" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
During the year they are forbidden to withdraw capital from the country in favor of the parent organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can only be representative when all members of society, including women, participate in them, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Choices can only be fully representative when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial council elections and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban threaten to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year's elections, power is moving peacefully from one democratically elected government to another for the first time.
Haysom said that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

Venice tightens fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities have tightened fines for bathing in canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walking around the city in a swimsuit or with a naked torso will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be demanded from those who will arrange a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle in pedestrian areas, TASS reports referring to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide for a fine for inscriptions on monuments 400 euros and for garbage 25 euros.

The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to The Venice Tourism Adviser Paola Mar, information about the fines will be passed to the embassies of the offending countries in order to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she said.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the flow of tourists.
Venice already has a successful limit on the number of tourists visiting the city center.
Instead of 100,000 people wanting to watch the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 guests were allowed to attend.
In addition, a moratorium has been imposed on the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.

SF relieved Ozerov from the post of head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the chairman of the defense and security committee Viktor Ozerov and dismissed him from this post.
He remains a senator from Khabarovsk region.
A statement asking for his dismissal of Ozerov wrote last week.
He explained his decision by the necessity of rotation and his desire to "change the rhythm of life."
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not immediate.

Electricity is getting cheaper for both residents and producers of Buryatia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for consumers of electric energy are beginning to bear fruit.
From September 1, the cost of electricity in low voltage for industrial recipients decreases by 25%.
The Federal Antitrust Service of the country in accordance with the Russian Government's Decree "On amending the Rules of the Wholesale Electricity And Power Market and in the consolidated forecast balance of production and supply of electric energy (power) within the Framework of the United Energy System of Russia under the subjects of the Russian Federation" (from 17.07.2017 No. 842) has established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat producers decreases by a quarter, which will make life much easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For decades, the leaders of the republic beat the thresholds of Moscow's offices in vain attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydroelectric power plants on Angara, flowing from Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryatia.
And only this year began to move.
In March, tariffs on electric energy for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles/kWh to 3.93 rubles/kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the list of territories of the price zones of the wholesale market, for which the features of the wholesale and retail markets are established, it is the turn of industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays 1.01 rubles per kilowatt hour.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date of new tariff moves in the direction of downwards for Buryatia.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) is concerned about investment at McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union is demanding assurances from the managers of biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term production commitment at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has been silent on the future of investment at the Toloro facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, cookies Hobnobs and Rich Tea, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, says it has invested more than 5 million pounds in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that in case of any changes in the work of the facility, employees and representatives of the union "will know about them first."
In a letter to the head of the company's facility, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded that McVitie's response to concerns that funding would not be used to upgrade production lines.
Senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "Members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the chief executive of the business and investment plan for the future of Tolcross."
Families have worked here for generations and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in Greater Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living wage and chronic production decline, Glasgow's East End desperately needs the prosperity of manufacturing at McVitie's factory.
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The head of the Toltros facility only received a letter yesterday from the Scottish branch of GMB and the company will respond immediately as we value our ongoing cooperation with staff and union representatives."
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tolcross, where we openly discussed a number of issues.
We talked to our employees about the fact that, as all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions - and this applies to all our facilities and activities - to remain competitive.
"In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tolkoro facility, especially in production lines and improved performance."

Putin says authorities won't give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the cabinet should be involved in the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (BNHC), but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, as well as Rosneft.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve the contradictions.
The head of state drew attention to the note that the relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District said that the lack of agreement with Gazprom on gas for NNHC jeopardizes the implementation of the project.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
Gazprom offers to find gas resources from The Rosneft perimeter, but we do not have such resources," Sechin added.
Rosneft asked to be allowed to use gas from Gazprom's Kirin field located on the Sakhalin shelf for the Eastern Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on the issue were continuing, and "there are no sharp corners there."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga player may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his buy-out, but did they warn Barcelona of setting a world record three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when the Ligue 1 club was poised to break the world record for the cost of a move, more than double the previous mark associated with Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
When the transfer is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offer him a salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week net.
Barcelona are known to be furious at the way the offer was made and how Neymar broke his contract, despite the fact that, according to a source close to the Catalan club's management, the club have always done their best for the player since his move from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world not warned of such a possibility three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the employment of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a severe warning to any club that would like to lure one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll play against them, we'll make offers to their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will face consequences."
Barcelona appeared to have crossed this line when the Spanish club expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG have made it clear that they will not let the Italian player go on any terms, and now it is likely that Barcelona feel the consequences of their offer in the form of the loss of one of their most valuable players, Neymar.
