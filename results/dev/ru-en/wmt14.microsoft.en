Germany first in Europe introduces "indefinite sex" when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow "indefinite" children born with hermaphrodites to be registered as children born to hermaphrodites.
The child's parents will have the right to leave the "sex" on the birth certificate unfilled for a while.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male), parents can write "X" (indefinite) for a while.
This decision is aimed at not encouraging parents to hurry with the operation to "clarify" the sex.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born hermaphrodite.
Anger over Bali terror attack organisers' verdict
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict handed down by the last of the conspirators, who was tried and said Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in creating the explosive devices used in the attack.
He could be released within 15 years if he was granted parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a spate of church bombings across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have demanded a life sentence, though they could insist that a man dubbed a "subversive" for his reputation as a bomb maker should be sentenced to death.
The decision compounded the painful memories of Perth mother June Cortines, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terror attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost a decade ago.
Barely holding back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
"I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
He should be brought before the firing squad," Ms Cortines told AAP.
"I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters."
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was detonated in a van parked outside just after 11pm on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where a suicide bomber detonated a backpack packed with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times, being connected to the life support system.
Mr Hughes said Patek should share the fate of three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the massacre- Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds is not that much.
Patek is the latest member of the Bali terror attack to stand trial.
He had been in hiding for nearly a decade, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed former al-qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence evidence showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish ties between the terrorist groups of Southeast Asia and Al-Kaida.
"He didn't give up," Ms. Cortines said.
Until recently, he had no regrets about how much grief he had caused other people.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the terror attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," Ms. Cortines said.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
Medvedev expects SSJ-100 aircraft to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects superjet 100 aircraft to be delivered to Europe once anchored in Latin America and Asia.
"We expect that in total we will receive such agreements for more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type," Interfax quotes Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev as saying at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with his French counterparts, as it is a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft strengthens in the Markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that one day it will be delivered to France," the Russian prime minister said.
The SSJ-100 is a aircraft built by Sukhoi Civil Aircraft in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is designed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment of 100 passenger seats.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Habibulin stressed that he understands that he has to play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the Hawks' last two games, Habibulin first missed six pucks against Tampa Bay and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I have not managed to do that, - CSNChicago quotes Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, probably, it is necessary to approach them as games, and try to achieve a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel quite decent.
But for some reason, after a few goals, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
Goalkeepers - I don't think I'm the only one - always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss as many pucks.
It's great that my teammates support, but in principle everything is simple: I have to play better.
Two games is not the whole season, but I wanted to play them much better.
But what happened happened.
I have to put that aside.
I'm just going to try to play better for the next match.
The energy industry of Dnipropetrovsk has started a unique program to save... nests of storks
In the old days, to bring to the court of storks, the villagers on a high pole installed a wheel from the cart, and a heavy nest was well kept on it.
Such special supports have not been put for a long time, so storks have chosen poles of power lines - intertwined branches are based on wires, so the aistic house is reliable.
Grandmother Anya, near whose house in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district for twenty years lives the eastern family, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put on top of new twigs, and the bottom layer has already sat between the wires, is about to collapse.
Of course, I feel sorry for the family of storks, who every year nested at the yard, bred and fed over the summer three or four chicks, but without light do not want to remain.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm lands, Grandma Anya called the Tsarichansky RES, which owns the support.
I didn't expect to react so quickly.
When our specialists came to Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest is still holding, - said Sergei Berezovsky, technical director of DTEK Dniproblanergo.
On the wires, which were, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150 - 200 kilograms, began corrosion.
At any moment the birds could have died from electric discharge.
And the locals risked being left without light because of the damage to the wires.
Therefore, linear installers have started an operation to save the nest, and not for the first time in our practice.
Ornithologists from the Dnipropetrovsk National University helped, who developed a scheme to move the nest.
They also conducted trainings for the employees of the district networks.
The well-known Dnipropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised energy engineers at all stages of nest reconstruction.
To begin with, it was estimated that more than 50 "apartments" are in a state of emergency in the region.
Special metal platforms resembling a funnel were welded for their reconstruction.
The base was woven with willy branches, and then moved there the old nest.
According to connoisseurs, it is enough to lay the old branches as a basis for the birds to know the nest and return to it.
Even then the storks will finish their own home.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka in the Novomoskovsky district.
Next to the electric pole put a new reinforced concrete pole and placed on it a platform with an old, already inhabited nest.
The whole operation cost the energy industry nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day the same housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district on the backyard of Ani's grandmother.
Here the platform was fixed in the same place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are sure that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has undergone an overhaul.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four more nests in the Pokrovsk and Tsarichan districts of Dnipropetrovsk.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others ruthlessly kill them.
The other day the whole region flew around the sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of the hunt for pheasants, poachers for fun shot the swan family, living on a local pond.
Noble birds were not afraid of people - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers, hearing gunshots, ran to the pond, four handsome swans were already lying on the water dead.
Now the officers of the Apostolovsky district police department are investigating who shot the birds listed in the Red Book.
Stuck in Chita American Boeing prepares for departure
The U.S. aircraft, which conducted observation flights over Russian territory under the Open Skies Treaty and made an unscheduled landing in Chita on Friday, November 1, at 8:30 Moscow time, will leave the city's air harbor.
Airport management allowed the flight to take off, receiving money for fuel.
According to the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan Ude.
According to other reports, he will go to the United States.
The plane, which was flying to Ulan Ude, reportedly landed in the region due to fog.
He was not allowed to leave Chita airport because of unpaid bills.
There are 30 people on board, including the crew, and they spent two nights at the airport, ITAR-TASS reported.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, according to the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, people on board the aircraft are not allowed to go outside the airport of Chita, they can pass border control only at two airports in Russia - in Kubinka and in Ulan Ude.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992 and involves 34 states.
Observation flights are made over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, European countries.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, to facilitate the monitoring of arms control agreements, to enhance crisis prevention and crisis management capabilities within the OSCE and other international organizations.
Vitaly Mutko: Water cannons?
I think we're back 15 years ago.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the riots in the stands during the match of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I am a supporter of the fact that the organizers of sporting events are responsible for all this: clubs, league, RFU.
But we see that they have taken a great stand.
They expect someone to come from the outside and clean up.
This is a very good position, but not quite right.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards, and not let things go.
We have now developed a special government regulation on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will deal with this problem.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
The state, they say, let's get the law fast.
It feels like the Bayern fans came to Yaroslavl and arranged it all.
And we're bystanders.
In general, it is terrible to see the podium being watered from the firespot.
And this is in a country that is preparing for the World Cup.
"I have a feeling that we are back 10-15 years ago," Mutko said.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who alerted ringleader of criminal gang to police investigation jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to crime boss Neil Scarborough
Lawyer feared his secret drug addiction would be uncovered
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told a drug lord about a major police investigation because he feared exposing his secret drug addiction has been jailed for three years.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave criminal authority Neil Scarborough classified information about an investigation into his drug trafficking activities after he was threatened by his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash and dubbed "cool lawyer among the offenders," was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to spy on Scarborough, whom he had previously represented in a drug trial.
Officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarborough had left three bags of cocaine outside the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a law association dinner with colleagues.
The inquest heard that Ditta "regularly used" the Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two men on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into the activities of a criminal heroin and cocaine trafficking organisation in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine in a series of raids, amounting to £1.5 million, as well as more than £200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to criminals out of fear that his cocaine addiction would be uncovered.
Today at Liverpool Crown Court, Ditt, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was shamed after pleading guilty to two counts of intentional obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted possession of cocaine at an earlier court hearing.
The lawyer's revelation came after police investigating Scarborough revealed that he had spoken to Ditt regularly by phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found him walking up to Ditt's home in Blackburn and placing the 60 per cent purity drugs in a black golf glove under the lawyer's bins.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough repeatedly called up WithItt, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers' Ewood Park football stadium.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine conversations took place between them.
The court heard that Ditta "regularly used" cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted their communication was a "lawyer's secret."
During his detention, Ditt took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and a hair sample was also taken from him.
When questioned by the police, he said that along with the workplace, he had a home office and clients came to his house for legal reasons.
However, the court heard that after the important arrests, he called the largest participants in drug trafficking, a number of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell them what detectives knew about them.
In the indictment, Anne White said, "If anyone knows that the law should not be broken, it is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditt is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he had entered into too close a relationship with certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly prove legitimate because he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the usual lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditt did not honor his profession, but shamed her.
He became too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and allowed to doubt his disinterest.
Ditta pleaded not guilty and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, of which I am not, and I would like to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done so immediately."
But after the hearing, senior officer Lee Halstead, of Lancashire Police, said: "Mr Ditta went from being a criminal lawyer to a criminal as soon as he started buying drugs from organised crime."
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the purposes of the main members of the criminal gangs, who entrusted him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditt betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind his profession.
The investigation into Mr Ditt led the Lancashire Specially Dangerous Organised Crime Unit, which has already succeeded him in three counts of cocaine possession and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire to ensure fair punishment for offenders.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
A further 35 people involved in the fraud were sentenced to 153 years in total for drug offences.
On his website, Ditt organized a question-and-answer conversation in which he says that his dream job is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the perfect companion for him at dinner - Muhammad Ali, and motivation in work - inequality.
Jet manufacturers feud over seat width when big orders at stake
A bitter dispute has erupted between major aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at this month's Dubai Aviation Show.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-haul flights to economy class passengers whose interests are not always the focus of airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the approval of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy-class cabins, but its main U.S. competitor Boeing says it should be up to airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in sales of increasingly large versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, with potentially record-breaking orders expected at the November 17-21 event.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft - especially whether 9 or 10 people are sitting in a row - is central to the statements about the economic effectiveness of the new "mini-airbus" projects.
Boeing says its revamped 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on seats in economy class of more than 17 inches wide, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says the rival version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class on 18-inch-wide seats, 9 in a row.
The giants of the aircraft industry often exchange blows on technical issues through advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is addressing the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what a new advertising war could be like by showing financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant huddled together, titled "Would you agree to that?"
"Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats narrower than regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
With the change in diet, people are gaining weight, but the aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set standards for modern long-haul travel, and the century-old weight of the average American male aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist girth of the average 21st century American male is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of seats of the 1950s, when the average waist girth of those recently called "reactive public" was already.
Airbus says it has commissioned a study showing that an extra inch of seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus's seat size figures and says manufacturers should not interfere with decisions about how airlines balance fares and amenities.
According to her, studies show that the convenience of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
"It really comes down to giving airlines the choice and the ability to do what they think they need to do to succeed," said Boeing cabin specialist Kent Craver.
They don't want us to decide for them what will make them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase space on the sides, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is the race for orders for planes valued at at least $700 billion at catalytic prices in the coming decades - enough to change the ratio of U.S. to European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, seating is exactly what fuels the rivalry in the battle between the newest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 percent increase in profitability per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's stated characteristics are based in part on the comparison of the 10-seat 777X series with the original 9-seat layout of the 777 design solution.
The winnings in unit cost are reduced when compared to the 10-seater layout currently in use.
"The reason Boeing is doing this is to cram more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our development," said Kevin Keniston, Airbus's head of passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with full 10-seater rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a tight seating that can go hand in hand with lower fares.
"Eighteen-inch seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus's offer is driven by the threat posed by the 777 model," said salon interior designer Mary Kirby, founder and editor of runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-travelling jet sellers even carry roulette to check competing layouts.
Touting comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense layout of cabin for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10-seater rows, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional cabin modifications, offering more seats at the aisle on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to "take off", but may divert attention from the wave of sales of the 777X model.
Oleynikov: a third of rural settlements in the suburbs are completely subsidized
Deputy Governor of the Moscow region Yuri Oleynikov said that almost a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region are completely subsidized
A total of 187 settlements out of 288 receive grants from the region's budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 - 100% subsidized.
About 25 billion rubles are sent from the regional budget within the framework of the budget," Oleynikov said.
The vice-governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mytisch, Odintsovo and Pushkino - have budget revenues of more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
Revenues of rural settlements in many areas are less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough."
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements in the suburbs is more than 70%, "at the same time there is a decrease in the quality of services," Oleynikov said.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of municipal entities in the suburbs to think about which settlements need to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or a change in the system of administrative management by the end of November.
These proposals will be worked out by the end of January.
Earlier, the governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in the suburbs it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in the Mozhai, Kashir, Sunnygorsk, Kolomen districts, Luberts and Kotelniks there is a request for consolidation of municipalities.
Discussions on the issue in cities and areas of the region will begin in November.
Igor Brynzalov, the chairman of the Mosobldum, also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of Moscow are planning to unite in the framework of the upcoming adm.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in the suburbs, less than a third have an "acceptable" financial base, and 100 - subsidized.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow as powerful people clash
Under a top-down statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to chant slogans about peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want the return of peace; we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, chief executive of the investment company.
Fearing for her country's future, she swapped the business suit for a T-shirt emblazoned with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the most violent skirmishes since the truce was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the apartheid-era South African government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 armistice, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to slide back into full-blown conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy because the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the Northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US.
Frelimo's ruling party, a leading political force since 1975, and renamo party blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo's party claims the government has been the instigator of recent clashes, attacking its members in Sofala province, the traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
Attacks on former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, a spokesman for Renamo, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating the clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Gebuza tried to allay fears of instability.
Gebuza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama felt like a "loser" who wanted to use "everything left of his forces to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears grew after reports that Mazanga had announced Renamo's rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he was referring to frelimo's non-compliance with the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but in all seriousness," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which have been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
"These are two powerful people (Gebuza and Dhlakama) who have faced their foreheads," said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo's party, which is trying to push for electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott municipal elections scheduled for Nov.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to secure concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), founded by former Renamo member, is expected to improve its performance in this election.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who is due to step down next year when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is not clear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on a key north-south highway.
Most of the skirmishes took place in Sofala province, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beira, a port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railway tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo's party wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased dissatisfaction with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and the recent increase in kidnappings, said Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and they have to find a solution to these problems," he says.
Omar Sultouan, a participant in the demonstration, said people just wanted stability.
"Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want a resumption of peace, they want free access to roads," he said.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Australian airline passengers will be required to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the US to relax the rules on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, provided they remain in "Flight Mode."
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision, which required US airlines to do a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but said they had no plans to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
"The Civil Aviation Safety Authority does not currently have specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it said.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at all times, and passengers to comply with safety rules reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on board, was not opposed to the changes but said it would follow the regulator's instructions.
"We would welcome the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's consideration of allowing the use of electronic devices because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the on-board wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft," the spokesman said.
It said it would abide by the current rules.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not plan to change them any time soon," she said.
The FAA's ruling applies to U.S. airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly look closely at the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the order will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio-phones from mobile devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage regulations and instructions for passengers.
"Once the airline checks and confirms its fleet's interference, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group's recommendation, heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper hold during take-off and landing.
Obama retracts his words on health care
Amid a storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday backtracked on his oft-repeated, unequivocal promise that "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it."
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people receive notifications to stop providing services from their providers, Republicans in recent days have criticized the president for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama tweaked his initial public promise.
"Most people with health insurance that works can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called a "news revival" about the shutdown, Obama urged the notifications of Americans to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to get better, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
"You get better terms," he said.
The administration said it should come as no surprise that 5% of people who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me say directly to these Americans: You deserve better," Sibelius said in a speech before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online sales site has been "appallingly bad" since October.
"I'm as upset and angry as everyone else," she said.
"I really want to regain your trust."
An exasperated Sibelius dropped the phrase, which was caught by a microphone held behind her by an aide at yesterday's House hearing after a heated debate with Rep. Billy Long, Republican of Missouri, about whether she was required to join Obama's health care program.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to explain why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily abandoned government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov it now imposes on millions of Americans.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be dealt with fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian law.
France can be sure that the case will be dealt with in compliance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee the following of the laws," Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisan, as well as other activists, are charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against the detained citizen," RIA Novosti quoted Mr. Ero as saying.
"Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to break the laws," Dmitry Medvedev said.
According to him, the activities of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy extraction, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were "like a powder keg" and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, RIA Novosti reports.
Semyon Varlamov's girlfriend says hockey player suffers from alcoholism
The girlfriend of hockey player Semyon Varlamov Evgenia Wawrinka said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," the woman said.
It should be reminded that Wawrinka has filed a lawsuit for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian national team Semyon Varlamov, who is also a member of the club "Colorado".
According to her, the hockey player dragged her by the hair and also beat her - after the attack her arms, chest, abdomen and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself went to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, detailing what happened.
He was arrested but later released on $5,000 bail.
The court did not restrict the athlete in travel around the country, but forbade to approach Wawrinka.
He also faces up to six years in prison for domestic violence.
Blizzard free-releases 19-year-old platformer
Blizzard Studios released its 1994 Platformer Blackthorne for free on PC.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game became available in Battle.net in the classic Games section of Blizzard.
However, some gamers note that currently only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it.
The game is also not available for Russian users.
According to media reports, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC, outwardly does not differ from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platformer, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
Its events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
Once the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight Sarlak's henchmen and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its renaming to Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon Synapse.
Blackthorne was publisher of Interplay.
Coulson used phone hacking to check confidential message
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to corroborate false information about the novel by Charles Clarke, who was then Home Secretary.
Prosecutor and crown barrister Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey that in May 2005 News of the World received the false news that Clarke was meeting with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulcair to hack Into Polby's voicemail and was waiting outside her home to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left voicemails, the court heard.
"The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand outside someone's house, hoping to catch someone by surprise, he is a person who likes to offer stories to people to see what they say," Mr. Edis said.
He said News of the World used three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
Rumours of Clarke's affair first caught the attention of News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms Polby was told: "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
The voicemail tape, received from her phone at least three times, was seized from Mulqueira's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found recordings on the private detective's computer in which Miss Polby and her sister were listed as "Projects."
During her time under surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis said.
Mean course, former chief reporter Neville Thurbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Ms. Polby's movements.
Leaving her voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and which I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr Edis said Coulson's involvement in the story was in the same way as with other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
Jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson had engaged in a confrontation with Mr Blunkett over an affair with a married woman while he was dating co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny colluding with other people to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcair, Thurbeck and Weatherup admitted to hacking into phones.
There is no "Brother's Circle" group in the bases of the Interior Ministry, to which Leps was included in the United States
The databases of the Russian security forces of the "Brother's Circle" group, to which Washington has named the singer Gregory Leps, are not included.
As interfax noted in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after the media reported on the inclusion of the U.S. Treasury Department Gregory Leps in the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate "Brother's Circle", all databases were checked, but such a group was not found.
The dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia" which supposedly operates abroad, according to the law enforcement agencies.
"Even in the very name - 'Brother's Circle', there is an element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret lodge.
"All this is very similar to a PR campaign," the source said.
On October 31, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it had placed Artur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lialin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov on their checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate "Brother's Circle".
The individuals on the list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Gregory Leps "serves as a courier to deliver money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev."
The production center Gregory Leps refused to comment on the U.S. accusations against the singer, calling them "nonsense."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama classified the Brotherhood syndicate as a "substantial transnational organized crime group" and instructed the Treasury Department to "undermine and prevent their global criminal operations."
Blacklisting a person on the U.S. Treasury Department's blacklisting entails blocking his assets in the U.S. and banning people living in the United States from doing business with him.
Scientists have shed light on how the movements of a dog's tail are related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that satisfied dogs wag their tails to the right side (from the dog's point of view), while alarmed dogs wave their tail predominantly to the left side.
But now scientists say that other members of the canine family may notice these subtle differences in tail wagging and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Wallortigara, a neuroscientist at Trent University, says: "It is well known that in humans the left and right sides of the brain are different in shaping the stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we tried to look at it in other species.
He added that just like humans, dogs have the right side of the brain controlling the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the versatile tail-twisting of other dogs, researchers watched the animals as they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
We'll probably find out soon why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other way.
Professor Wallortigara said: "We showed dogs videos of dogs - either naturalistic versions or silhouettes - to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more left or right."
When the animals saw that otherwise the non-expressing dog was moving the tail to the right (in terms of the dog's wagging tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was leaning mostly to the left (again in terms of the dog's wagging tail), their heartbeat increased and they looked alarmed.
Professor Wallortigara said he did not think the dogs intentionally communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should worry about and which ones they shouldn't.
He notes: "If there are several encounters with other dogs and often the waging of their tail to one side is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say these results could give owners, veterinarians and trainers a better understanding of their animal's emotions.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting research fellow at the University of Bristol Veterinary School, said this was not the first study to test whether the left and right sides mattered to dogs.
Last year, a team of scientists at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads left when looking at an aggressive dog, and right when looking at a happy dog.
And in another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail was wagging to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming alarmed - the opposite of the behaviour towards the Italian study."
He said the differences could be because dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in films or robot dogs as dogs.
It might be useful to study how dogs respond to real dogs, he explained.
"While there is ample evidence for different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we will probably soon see why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives to determine what changes the creators of the UK's welfare and jobs want to see in relations with the EU.
To that end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide slice of business in the UK by size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are now looking for export opportunities outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and difficult process of reforming the EU's tangled institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust to product laws, most business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives saying that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweighed the benefits of being in Europe's trade zone, even 40 percent of large businesses, traditionally the most pro-European, agreed.
The latest and most revealing survey of business leaders has revealed that a clear majority wants the UK to pursue a course towards treaty change and on a trade-based relationship with the EU, not politics.
This result, which has been seen among businesses of all sizes and major business groups, shows that businesses are pushing for a "meaningful change" that will bring the powers back to the UK.
The stakes are high - achieving treaty changes and better terms for the UK will provide a 16 per cent shift in the vote to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's MEMBERSHIP of the EU.
It also shows that the business expects the revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
Better conditions for British business are possible and increasingly needed as the eurozone embarks on a closer economic and financial pool.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and our survey shows that for business this means a greater focus on trade and fundamental changes in the regulatory environment in Brussels.
Politician in Turkey went on hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began building a separation wall near the town of Nusaybin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish PMD party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish town of Nusaybin, Aisha Gekhan, on the border with Syria, has gone on hunger strike to protest against the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA Novosti reported in the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMD) on Friday.
Police repeatedly dispersed the protests.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammer Guler initially denied the construction, then said that the wall is being built to ensure border security.
"The mayor of Nusaybin, Aisha Gekhan, a member of the PMD, went on hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," the party's press service said.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds crossed the border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhumane situation that the Kurds will never agree with," Aisha Gekhan was quoted as saying by the party.
According to the press service, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is planned in Nusaybin on November 7.
This morning in the Sarat district, the driver of the car "Peugeot" drove into the oncoming lane on the 115 km of the Odessa-Reni highway, and collided with a bus with six people.
This is reported by the press service of the Department of Emergency Situations in the Odessa region.
The 31-year-old driver of the Peugeot was killed in the incident.
A 55-year-old female passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver were injured when his leg was pinned.
Medics gave the woman first aid on the spot, she refused to be hospitalized.
Ambulance officers also examined all other passengers.
Rescuers used a crane to lift the bus and free the bus driver, whose leg was trapped in the bus door.
In Siberia, do not be a vegan: greenhouse tomato will not replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, RIA Novosti correspondent found out.
People who have completely given up animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they can not endure the winter without losses for health, and no greenhouse tomatoes do not compensate them, according to the Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors interviewed on the eve of vegan Day.
Drink oil litres
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists believe that in Novosibirsk and other Siberian cities to adhere to such strict standards in nutrition, at least, is not useful for health.
Complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for plant.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the diet," - the nutritionist Marina Bogay is sure.
She cites the example of fish containing essential omega-3 fatty acids.
The richest vegetable oil - flaxseed.
"To consume it in the quantities necessary for a person, you need to drink liters!" - says the nutritionist.
Doctors believe that Siberians should pay special attention to the diet in winter.
This season vegetarianism is especially questioned.
In the conditions of our realities, there are high demands on food.
In order not to freeze, you need an increased calorie.
"If a person limits himself to animal products, respectively, he does not get this calorie," the expert says.
Dietitian Olga Pozniak agrees.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not an option.
It is better for a person to eat mainly foods that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is set up for the best absorption and digestion of these products.
And in winter, people want not to eat a cucumber, but a hot soup or something more sobbled," the doctor explains his position.
According to her, from what can eat vegans, really useful various cereals, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples, remaining in the winter, frozen berries.
But this, unequivocally, is not enough for a full diet.
According to gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians have enough vitamins in their bodies only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our tough natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and in May the snow lies, is impractical.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, first of all, fat," the medic says.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
And adhering to vegetarianism, we give them inferior.
Pregnant women also need an increased protein content, vitamins and trace elements on the menu.
"Vegans don't get them," Bogay said.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything "to play the toys he wants."
He has already formed organism, skeleton, organs.
And children still have to eat fully.
If the parents deprive him of some trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones tomorrow will not be restored," she says.
All the medical specialists interviewed agree on the low quality of winter-grown greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses, contains less micronutrients, than (grown) in the open ground.
"The quality of the products is not the same," says Bogay.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest more crops is detrimental to quality.
"Apples don't turn brown on the cut, cucumbers turn yellow and mould, tomatoes are tasteless and non-aromatized," the medic cites examples, adding that they are most likely stuffed with excess fertilizer.
And become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fiber.
Vera Petruk, Ph.D., Ph.D., disagrees with this.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all norms and requirements in greenhouses it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If they try to drive more from a square meter, then, of course, and water will be more often, and overfeed plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there are too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened," she explains, adding that the issue of quality, first of all, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.
Russia out of the fight for pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of major cities have been observed in most megacities of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was either about their remodeling and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
The example of Singapore, where the growth of private cars has been strictly quotas, and the right to purchase them is bought at auctions, is widely known.
Its price can be two to three times higher than the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry into the city centre.
In Germany, for example, Hamburg and Stuttgart introduce so-called green zones, which are allowed to enter only cars with a certain eco-class, which also uses high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric cars).
Beijing's Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a "five-year clean air plan" in 2012 with a total value of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
According to Li Kunsheng, Director of the Transport Pollution Control Division of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, the main goal of the five-year period is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increase the number of private cars to the level of not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), and increase the use of fuel per vehicle by no more than 5%.
According to the agency, vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program - limiting the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the city's measures of the "green five-year" include an accelerated transition to European fuel standards compared to the rest of the country, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and labeling of cars and fuel, a restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, a ban on the use of outdated vehicles (in addition, the creation of incentive financial programs to replace old cars with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric vehicles (including society) development of public transport (including high-speed).
Beijing's automotive innovations also include a ban on all private cars from driving within the fifth transport ring (there are six in the Chinese capital) one day a week (the relevant information is contained in the vehicle's license plate), as well as issuing registration plates for cars based on the lottery (e.g., in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number of private cars in Beijing). 2010).
According to the current state program "Environmental Protection for 2012-2020," the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, in 2011 "mobile sources" accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In Russia, just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy at the HSE, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel are notoriously unpopular, they can be accepted by society only if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of weakly sensitive to any regulatory impact - service and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is at least 200,000 (about 5% of the total fleet of Moscow).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential development, the area of the road surface and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of the researchers: the city center is provided with roads half the required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking, but car storage facilities, not to expand, but to reduce the roadway (so that the streets become more friendly to pedestrians), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the boundaries of the protected area of the historical center (a common area of about 3,212 hectares, covering a number of central areas of the city).
The increase in the price of fuel will lead to a tax maneuver, which provides for an increase in the tax on extraction of minerals (NDPI) on oil at the same time as the reduction of export duties and the increase in excise taxes.
According to experts, these measures can bring to the budget an additional 619.3 billion rubles.
Ride through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwell provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwell and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country - only one in 5,000 people
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwell is one of CNN's top 10 characters in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to become CNN Hero of the Year.
This man will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwell saw his father return to life and fall unconscious again, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, Cameroon's capital.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but the infection spread to his brain and caused a hematoma, which reminded him of himself for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwell.
If we had the money, we'd take him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwell accompanied his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals for years, receiving any treatment they could receive.
"It's not easy," Bwell said.
"You can leave home at 5am, run to the hospital to be the first, but you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation hasn't changed much since Bwell's father passed away in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health spending there is private.
"Their only problem is poverty," Bwell said.
"And because of poverty, they can't enjoy their lives."
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, Bwell was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwell and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
He also founded asCOVIME, a non-profit organization that organizes weekend trips to the countryside to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others are crammed into vans, tied to rooftops with medical supplies and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need.
They are not always lucky.
More than once they had to push cars through rivers and mud.
But when they come, they are greeted like real heroes: it is a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms that the locals can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is really an occasion for celebration, and Bwell with his broad smile and boundless energy is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
"We welcome 500 people on every trip," Bwell said.
They come from all over the area within a 60 kilometer radius of the village and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - documents needed for school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school building, municipality or in a house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative zone to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to light the operating and sanitary treatment equipment, Bwell and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
This is an unbearable pace, but the determination of the brigade usually helps to support the village musicians.
"They beat the drums all night so we could stay awake and keep working," Bwell said.
On Sunday, the brigade members head back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and international medical students, has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year and they know that their help can make a huge difference to those they help.
One person explained that the free hernia surgery he had received would allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family," the man said.
In addition to these weekend clinical appointments and hospital work, Bwell's surgeon also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaounde.
It is this second job, he said, that provides 60% of the funding for his nonprofit organization; the rest are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Kathy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer with the Bwell group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that he can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses like O'Malley coming from the U.S. and Europe to join Bwell in his tasks, this is an opportunity for practice they would never have received at home.
"We were able to assist in surgeries where we helped remove blood stains or hold tools for Dr. Bwell," O'Malley said.
As a sophomore, you would never get that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But upon arrival in Yaounde, their food, transport and training are paid for by Bwell.
"He's a hero, no doubt about it," O'Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, almost constant workload is not an ordeal.
Helping others live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to your father is what brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," Bwell said.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Visit asCOVIME and see how you can help.
A new name - "Brother's Circle" - has finally been fixed for the "Russian mafia" in the United States
This week, the blacklist of the "Russian mafia" in America was added to new names and four companies.
The U.S. Treasury Department has introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli to the Fraternal Circle.
One of the Russians was the famous singer Gregory Leps, whom the U.S. is suspected of transporting money for members of the group.
In total, there are 22 people on the U.S. blacklist who are affiliated with the Brotherhood and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts have expressed doubts that such an organization actually exists.
"The 'Brother's Circle' statement is more like an attempt to bring together disparate criminal groups," Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and a professor at the University of New York, said earlier.
In his opinion, "Brother's Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia."
"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement or anywhere else who confirms the existence of such a criminal organization," the American Center for Corruption and Organized Crime Research quoted Mr. Galeotti as saying.
Liz Shelley, a professor at George Mason University, agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
"If they work together, it's more like a criminal network, but not an organization," the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime quotes her as saying.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that "Brother's Circle" unites more close-ups of Russian kingpin Aslan Usoyan, known as Ded Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Kalashov, who joined the list in 2012, were closely related to Ded Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoyev, was Ded Hassan's nephew.
Nevertheless, Mr. Galeotti notes that some individuals have nothing to do with Usoyan.
In his view, they were all united by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Grigory Leps - a favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin - in the "Brother's Circle" attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect that we will receive more detailed information from our American colleagues," said Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the head of state.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
Tony Blair has said he will seize the chance to return as UK prime minister but admits a return is unlikely.
In an interview marking the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic politics in an interview marking the fifth anniversary of his resignation.
Since retiring in June 2007, after a decade as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the four Middle East peacekeepers.
Asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it's unlikely to happen, so ..."
AC Milan head coach Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret over the draw in the 10th round match of the Italian league with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start are caused by a series of injuries of leading players.
I am very sorry that we failed to win, - Tmw quotes Allegri.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half we didn't allow Lazio anything.
In the second Romans added, but in general I can not say that we lost concentration.
We had to win.
Last season we fulfilled the task of getting into the Champions League.
Now we are behind schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries of key players.
Rami and Honda?
These are very good players, with character.
However, our squad is still good.
Take a look at Kaka, who held the meeting at a high level.
British police give Assange extradition notice
British police today handed over a notice of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and sought asylum.
Scotland Yard said they had handed the 40-year-old Australian an "official request to surrender" with a request to report to the police station, adding that he would be subject to further arrest if the requirement was not met.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on sex crimes charges after he exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June, seeking political asylum from the South American country.
Scotland Yard "handed a 40-year-old man a formal request to surrender, which obliges him to come to the police station on the day and time of our choice," the spokesman said.
He continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the police notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the US to face possible espionage charges after more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables were posted on the secretive WikiLeaks website.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Yeltysheva" translated into French.
Recall, it was his novel was the finalist of four awards: "Clear glade," "Russian Booker," "National Bestseller" and "The Big Book."
And last year the writer for this book was awarded the prize of the government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is the undoubted leader in the generation of current thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prose writers.
Almost every publication of his rigid, built on the modern life material of stories and stories causes heated debate among critics of different directions.
It can be argued that the articles collected on Senchin's prose and journalism, reviews of his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial contemporary writers," according to critic Sergei Chuprinin, the speech is mostly about what its participants understand by the word "literature", how they see the present and future not only of our literature, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow to include most articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are usually given in abbreviations in the sections "Abzas..."
Snowden may be interrogated in Russia
Former US intelligence official Edward Snowden is likely not to travel outside Russia to testify in wiretapping cases of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
A source familiar with the situation told Interfax on Friday that the American can answer questions from representatives of the German Prosecutor General's Office in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status and can be extradited to Washington by U.S. allies," the source said.
"At the same time, in principle, the German Prosecutor General's Office could send representatives to Russia or pass written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that the issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, the deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele said that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of wiretapping by the American intelligence services of the German Chancellor' negotiations.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in Germany.
The ex-CIA officer made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the U.S. NSA has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival," Strebele told Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement of the Source of Interfax, said that his client can cooperate with German investigators, but when and how - will decide for himself.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he disclosed information about secret operations of U.S. intelligence agencies on internet surveillance.
Snowden was transiting through Moscow, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport was revoked by U.S. authorities, who brought serious charges against him in absentia, and remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until early August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a year and left Sheremetyevo on the same day.
Yesterday, the lawyer of the American Anatoly Kucherena said that his client got a job in a "large Russian company."
The NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel was reported by german media last week.
According to journalists, the Americans began to listen to the Chancellor's telephone conversations back in 2002.
The security station was allegedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
German authorities said after the publication of this information that the surveillance of Merkel violates German laws and sovereignty.
Land Rover racing series announced
Inside are racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an internal communication system.
In addition, you can get upgraded brakes, a package of services that provides access to bowler works mechanics, logistics support and car storage between activities.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rally participants in bowler have changed."
Some are not experienced riders, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, as well as prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of rally-raid.
We were very happy to develop the Defender Challenge car - it will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to participate in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Children should study myths and legends as "lifestyle models," the author says.
Tales of the Torah could show that "brute force cannot defeat a refined cunning", and legends about King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to teach in schools," Crossley-Holland advocates "careful selection" of age-appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have advocated the introduction of them into the curriculum for twenty years.
He added that the "excessive moralizing" of authors and teachers "discourages interest" in children, and the main ideas are "sublimated" into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and also wrote "A Collection of Norwegian Myths" for Penguin and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have intentions, of course, but you better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult adult author and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there should be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And this should be sublimated; disclosed through history rather than clearly articulated.
The old principle: show, not tell.
Goldman Sachs warns of risks to Russian economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of growing risks to the main driver of Russia's fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is completely conditioned by consumption, which almost does not slow down," said Clemens Graf, chief economist of Goldman Sachs for Russia, presenting yesterday the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
Now nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
With an inflation rate of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so most likely, they will deal with optimization of personnel costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, - explained Mr. Graf.
Companies have faced a decline in profitability.
If it does not grow, it could lead to layoffs and higher unemployment.
Russian business cannot not raise salaries, commented Vladimir Pantyushin, chief economist at Barclays Capital for Russia and CIS.
Unemployment is near historic lows, competition for workers is high.
In order to lure employees from outside or to keep the current ones, employers have to raise salaries.
Consumption in Russia is supported by a very rapid growth in consumer credit.
According to Mr. Graf, because of the extremely high rates on consumer loans, this type of lending does not have a multiplier effect on the country's economy.
"We have not seen any benefits for the economy from the growth of consumer credit, the money does not diverge on the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem is another - Goldman Sachs expects an increase in arrears on unsecured loans.
They are taken mainly by poor people who have nothing to provide.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are often not returned," Mr. Grafe said.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia - a possible crisis of non-payment on unsecured loans.
Vasily Solodkov, director of the HSE Banking Institute, is already seeing signs of an impending banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to cheap resources, as state banks have, were forced to attract the funds of the population at high interest rates.
In response, state banks took to the war and began to reduce credit rates, - the economist continues.
Small credit organizations cannot issue loans at the same interest rates, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If state banks do not refuse dumping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The economist considers the deprivation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks a harbinger of mass collapse.
"The state banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis," the head of the institute warns.
But the growth of consumption will slow down without the crisis of non-payments, according to the investment bank - because of the refusal to index salaries of civil servants and military, laid down in the current version of the draft budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, by a decrease in inflation).
But only partially: if the investment does not grow (and there are no prerequisites for this yet - see reference), consumption growth will still slow down, according to Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantyushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for implementing pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still the fall in the price of oil," he says.
According to his estimation, the Russian economy will begin to shrink at the cost of oil below $90/barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has decreased, and banks began to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to inflation targeting," Clemens Grafet said.
The interest policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, affects only the rates of interbank lending.
"For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hopes," Clemens Graf said.
The money received at the central bank's auctions is used by banks not to lend to the economy, but to manage their liquidity
As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate changes immediately, it means that the funds are trying to go on speculation against the ruble.
"Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work," said Mr. Graf, who reminded that the state plans to let the ruble into "free float" by the end of 2015.
But we will either have to do it earlier or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he believes.
According to his estimation, the ruble exchange rate is now artificially inflated by 10%.
The ruble has only one road - to weaken - the expert concludes.
But if the Central Bank casts in financiers even a shadow of doubt that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it can bring down the ruble much more strongly.
Snowden agrees to testify about Merkel's wiretapping
Hans-Christian Strebele, a member of the Bundestag, met with Edward Snowden.
During the conversation, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the German Prosecutor General's Office in the case of possible wiretapping of the phone of the German Chancellor by us special services.
Snowden expressed willingness to testify.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, Hans-Christian Strebele said, that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival. .
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding U.S. spyware.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. Electronic Intelligence Agency.
FAA: "Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not to call from a mobile phone)"
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not talk on mobile phones, according to a long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and device styling rules to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
"Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve the expansion of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane door closes.
They must not restart them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain gives "goodness."
Passengers should turn off their devices again when the plane is dropping for landing, and do not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference can allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most of the new airliners and other aircraft modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glaiding, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new policy is implemented safely (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option," Glaiding said.
We are frankly tired of feeling "on duty at school" when it comes to this issue.
But Internet connectivity for surfing, email exchange, text messaging or data downloads will still be banned at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
Thus, there is still no "Words with Friends" - an intelligent internet game, which actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when there was a sensational case: the actor was removed from the American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was at the gate.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be stowed in the luggage compartment as they can injure someone if they fly all over the cabin.
Calls from mobile phone in-flight will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory powers over phone calls belong to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know through the FCC that they can interfere with cell towers when the plane is in the air," Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to look into the issue recommended last month that the government allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been mounting on the FAA to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, argue that there are no security reasons for the bans.
Compliance with the restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began carrying FM radios, high-tech gadgets of the time.
The new airliners are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for several years.
Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are adapted for increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices typically emit much lower power radio signals than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal signals when flipping pages.
But signals become more powerful when devices download or send data.
Among those who sought to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was the company Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company loaded an entire airliner with its Kindle e-book reader and flew it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passenger Association said he believes interference from the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said there were only isolated reports from pilots confirming that the devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of those messages were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to require passengers to disable devices during landings on instruments in limited visibility.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers who now use a variety of technological devices.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and protection," said Roger Doe, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of trying to slander Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the Eastern Partnership countries - such a statement was made to the BNS agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
Information about this is published on the portal DELFI.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to "negotiate" Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archive, which relate to the facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the information attack is being prepared by the Department of Analysis of Public Processes of the Russian Presidential Administration's Office for Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania several times and took part in the congress of the Lithuanian People's Party.
Also involved in the operation is allegedly an employee of the department V. Smirnov.
According to the intelligence service, Smirnov, under the guise of scientific work until the end of 2012, regularly came to Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Now Smirnov is banned from entering the country.
The day before, Lithuanian President Grybauskaite announced that she was aware of the information on it.
In her opinion, the main reasons are Lithuania's successful presidency of the Council of the European Union and the country's "aspiration for energy independence"
The Lithuanian leader has previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities more than once.
She said the Kremlin was treated "not with respect."
In addition, Grybauskaite accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of making "only demands" to Lithuania.
In September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended imports of Lithuanian milk to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the products did not meet sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Then the lithuanian leader said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the country's government should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
New anti-anti-polio vaccine may deprive the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-silicon vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were encouraging.
"We very much hope that this vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern remedies," Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information to produce anti-silicon antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies track down any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine strike.
In the tests, vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And mice who weren't given the vaccine "relaxed, and this is a sign that nicotine has reached their brains," the researchers said.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they wanted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it might help them get rid of that habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.

Frontier Airlines will charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though their announcement on Wednesday stated that passengers would be able to keep the entire jar.
The new carry-on baggage fee applies to bags in the upper hold, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelers pay only once they reach the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee should force passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge for it," she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second bags in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these fees fill as much as they can in the hand luggage placed in the upper hold, which often makes these compartments often lack space.
Fees are one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new levy isn't really for money.
The fact is that frontier's most loyal customers say that finding a place in the upper hold is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the gate of the Frontier flight can be able to carry the bag for free, while the next passenger in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said the change in procedures on the Frontier website and check-in desks is designed to ensure that passengers are aware of the fee before they get to the boarding gate.
The new Frontier fee for carry-on luggage will not begin to be charged until the summer, although a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines adore them.
They argue that handling luggage costs money and passengers who need the service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most of them did not deal with the fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first pick-up fee three years ago, and another allegiant Air discounter later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage fee brings in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew a Spirit flight, and he wondered what he would find at the boarding gate when passengers face an unusual Spirit fee for hand luggage.
"The boarding process was the smoothest I've seen in my airline career," he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and a fight at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing went smoothly."
Frontier also follows Spirit against a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive soda or juice can keep the whole can and that coffee tossing will be provided free of charge.
It will still give away water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but refused seven months after passengers started complaining and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier's initiative to charge for carry-on baggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is its latest measure to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further than anyone else in this area.
In September, it began giving half the bonus miles to frequent flyer customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium number of miles to 25 percent of the trip's miles.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip from Frontier purchased from an online travel agency would have allowed for 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only choose a seat in advance if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becoming unprofitable.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flight opportunities fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to improve Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
Putin achieves impunity for his friend Assad
And now - news from the ocean, namely from Syria, where, as we learned today, Israel struck Russian-made missiles, which were reportedly intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its chemical weapons production by November 1.
This was done as part of an agreement brokered by Russia that allowed the U.S. not to conduct the military operation it came close to this summer.
Our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel, will tell us more about weapons and what it all means for the Syrian president.
Washington has said the Assad regime will be punished for it.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed in August by poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal that was arranged by Assad's friend - Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had shut down the alleged chemical weapons factories.
The longer-term and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components to them.
As we understand, it is about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad's days are numbered.
I believe Assad should go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimized and must leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and ill-armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The chemical weapons agreement is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself impressed a man willing to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the U.S. Ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of starvation, his mother is hardly relieved that he was not killed with chemical weapons.
Assad is still holding on.
And he's changing his weapon to power.
Tomic will work 240 hours for extremist video on social media
The Leninsky District Court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of mandatory work a resident of the city, who posted a video of extremist orientation on the social network, a representative of the press service of the regional court told RIA Novosti on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page on the popular social network, which is included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was opened against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as humiliation of the dignity of a person committed in public."
"The Leninsky District Court considered the case in a special order and found the man guilty of the above crime, imposing a penalty of 240 hours of mandatory work," the interlocutor of the agency said.
She added that the man had fully pleaded guilty.
Parents of intersex children may choose 'indefinite gender'
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex in children born with intermediate-type external genitals.
Newborns will no longer have to be attributed male or female gender.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to specify gender as "indefinite" or "unspecified" on their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to relieve pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions about sex-appropriate operations for newborns and to counteract discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex man, according to the BBC, said years later: "I'm not a man or a woman."
I'm going to be a patchwork with bruises and scars created by doctors.
Approximately one in two thousand children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexness, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual developmental disorders" - a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed external genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still understudied, but most experts in the U.S. say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all the available information and assign it, than to wait and monitor a child's psychological and physical development before undergoing surgery, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law "sounds like a good idea."
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children don't," he said.
You can assign the gender without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child will develop a gender identity is not very precise.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as being different from transsexual or transgender people because their condition is not related to gender but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to either male or female sex, and is typical of both at the same time or not typical of either of them.
These characteristics may occur in secondary genitals, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and physique; primary genitals, such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice crimes.
Boys with gender disabilities now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put male, female or "third sex" in their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norri Mae-Welby became the first person in the world to be recognised as "asexual," defending the right to maintain "indefinite" sexual status for life in court.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passports will use a third designation in addition to M and F-X, that is intersex.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, a prominent Catholic country, signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state, where gender is the subject of choice, and sexual activity is not, we turn two more pillars of civilization."
One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the website Baby zone that she would prefer that children be given gender at birth.
"Raising a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, named after a beautiful Greek god who had signs of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community saw gender as a sheet on which to erase everything and then draw again.
But now many are challenging the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how a child will perceive the sex assigned to him when he grows up.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called an "emergency psychiatric case,"" Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist - you called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with intermediate-type genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily changeable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that environmental cues, including social signals - the way parents raise a child - interact with a child's genes and hormones, determining whether a person considers himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as "John/Joan," his theories were called into question.
He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during the negligent circumcision, to completely neuter the child, also removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it wasn't," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors are still "applying this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these gender reassignment surgeries declared themselves "dissatisfied with the result."
That was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male XY chromosomes but in-between genitalia.
Doctors could not determine for sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live the "full life" of a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external genitals and testicles were surgically removed and he was brought up as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was prescribed vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he learned was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
Learning the truth, he again became a man, receiving injections of testosterone and removing his chest.
The surgery made him infertile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexness.
But Anne Temar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based legal association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law "encourages labeling and stigma."
"Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an "indefinite gender,"" she said.
We are afraid that he will facilitate intervention.
We think it is best to assign male or female gender and then wait.
But we haven't seen how this law works, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Temar-Mattis said her organisation supports Australian law because "it allows adults to opt for a third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender," she says.
German law implies its appropriation at birth.
It's a battle that young children shouldn't be involved in at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammologist-radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual disability and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law will "support" both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual disorder called "androgen insensitivity syndrome."
Because her androgenic receptors are not working properly, Katie developed female traits.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now 29 years old, Katie is married and undergoes residency in pediatric psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do some analysis and sort out the situation, as well as a period of time before they write "male" or "female."
In this case, you are fine - raise a child, love the child.
You have a wonderful child and you feel joy.
We don't have to hastily do an operation that's irreversible.
"It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that drives parents because they don't feel they're doing the right thing," she said.
Eventually, the child decides which gender he or she is more comfortable with, which is great.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
U.S. Secretary of State: Intelligence agencies sometimes "went too far" in data collection
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that U.S. intelligence agencies sometimes "went too far" in collecting data and wiretapping, but the politician noted that the information about the wiretapping of 70 million people appeared in the media is not true.
I assure you that innocent people were not harmed in this process, but the attempt to gather information was made.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was illegal.
I recognize this, as the president admits... and we will make sure that doesn't happen in the future," AFP quoted the secretary of state as saying.
Equestrian experts flocking to Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year prize knew the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the appearance of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before having taken his first steps, this toddler with his pet Shetland pony Toffee trot rushed through three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
The inseparable pair - of equal height - received high marks for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition, held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Radri, near Cardiff.
Appearing on public display against a backdrop of men and women in sleek bowler hats, he shifted his cap and proudly held two-year-old Toffee in a circle.
The judges praised Fenton for his unborn innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffee received the highest rating for his appearance and character.
Fenton was presented with Toffee on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been practicing with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said: 'Fenton and Toffee are a lovely duo.'
They had a lot of opponents, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second appearance with Toffee and we were all thrilled when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Ebb Vale in South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms Howells said: "The whole audience was amazed and everyone was shouting cheers and clapping."
He ran along the sand the entire length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens that he takes care of.
Judging by the way he started, he will soon be taking part in Horse of the Year - and I'm sure he'll perform well.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian exhibition said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony."
Together they are a great team.
The judges praised Fenton and Toffee for their appearance and for the way they presented themselves in the show ring.
They appreciate the coherence of the pony and breeder- Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his eye-catching outfit, he looked really good in his role.
A bus overturned in Altai.
In the Rubtsov district of the Altai region, a bus overturned.
As a result of the accident, according to the specified data, 13 people were injured, the regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations said.
Earlier, law enforcement agencies in the region reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred at about 9 a.m. local time on the road Novonikolaevka - Visnieevka, 1 kilometer from Novonikolaevka.
The bus from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka was carrying 12 passengers and the driver, all suffered injuries of varying degrees of severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven of the victims were taken to the City Hospital No.1 Rubtsovska, and two people were hospitalized in rubtsovska CRB.
Court suspends "stop-and-search" practice at New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals suspended a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-search program and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said the execution of Judge Shira Sheindlin's decision would be halted pending the outcome of an appeal filed by the city.
In August, a judge ruled that the city had violated the constitution in the way it carried out a program on street detentions and interrogations.
The city has filed an appeal against its decision and corrective action orders, including an injunction to appoint a comptroller to help the police department change its work practices and related training programs.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the parties debate on the motion to dismiss the case.
The appeals court said the judge should be recused because she violated the U.S. judges' code of conduct and did not consider the need to avoid a show of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably addressing blacks and Latinos under the stop-and-search program.
It has appointed an external comptroller to oversee major changes, which include reforms to policies, training and control, and has decided to launch a pilot programme to test body-mounted video cameras in the police stations where most arrests occur.
In August, New York decided to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were discontinued after a police check.
The debate on the city's appeal is due to take place after March 14, 2014.
The "stop and search" tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
"Stop-and-search" has been practiced for decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of them black and Latino.
In 2004, four people, all from national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the stop-and-search program at the New York Police Department say the changes will put an end to unfair practices, develop a more robust and effective police service, and may affect how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the morale of police officers rather than the crime rate, lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult police conditions due to a reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not stop the "stop-and-search" practice, which was constitutional, but was changing the way the Nypd police stopped people.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse in commodity prices after signing association with the European Union
Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will decrease significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with readers of his Facebook page.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the free trade zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And this will mean that prices should fall.
"This is about goods coming from EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
But, nevertheless, there should also be no price increase.
Therefore, the messages on billboards, which have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is a price increase, it is not quite so, or to be more precise - not so," Azarov concluded.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's health
The federal government insists a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's weakened health system will be complemented by stringent conditions that ensure the state government does not waste money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said the Commonwealth was taking "urgent action" to avert a crisis caused by the island nation's ageing population, higher levels of chronic disease and system constraints.
The decision to fund the funding for four years came after a government consultation with Tasmania's independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific challenges facing the state," Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a planned blitz campaign.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will help bridge the gap.
There is also money for clinics that receive patients without pre-recording in Hobart and Launceston to improve the quality of post-hospital care, training of medical professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health card systems in local hospitals.
"This investment will go towards the best-case 100-year-old's ideas on how best to help Tasmania's health system," Ms Plibersek said.
The minister insisted the Tasmanian government would operate in a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where it spends the extra money.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the staff provides services as efficiently and more efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million would not be decided "unless they are followed by genuine reform that will put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable footing."
Nevertheless, he praised the Government for responding to its request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to the state's critical health system," Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the State Government, these additional sample procedures largely offset recent reductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton said today's announcement was a "decision similar to that of a band-aid."
"The reason we're here is because the state Labor government has taken $430 million out of the health care system," he told ABC TV.
When the state government takes away almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests $300 million, you can't pretend it's good news.
Mr Dutton asked Ms Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The Cry of Obama's Voter Despair
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He says Obama has allowed obstructionism by Republicans to nullify laudable efforts.
Obstructionism is no excuse for problems with Obama's reformed health care system, drone attacks
The memoirs of Obama's 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
I thought that this book would inspire me in times of despondency in my second year of medicine and revive my sense of hope.
It's called "Audacity to Win," and it's a memoir about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients in the evening and go to bed, this book brings me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people and speeches could take a breath.
The election victory was impressive, and leading news programs paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents kept out all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists was supposed to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his support rate was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a rude awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism - they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I cast my first ballot, change has indeed taken place.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and varied accomplishments, from passing the Affordable Care Act to withdrawing our military from Iraq, repealing the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" rule, killing Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the choice of public health care and the closure of the Guantanamo Bay base among others.
But after countless times when I've sided with the Obama administration, defending it in front of colleagues and peers, I've run out of explanations that I can provide.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing foreign leaders to be wiretapped or drone strikes against innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain the collection of data on the privacy of Americans by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of whistleblowers who disclose government misconduct.
He cannot explain the murder of an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, without trial or non-compliance with government funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the report's findings, which say the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And lately it can't justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after signing the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I'd expect.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that leadership can contradict the political campaigns that precede it?
It is obvious that running for elected office is not a predictable agenda, as our public dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and by events such as the Newtown massacre.
Nevertheless, all of the examples I have mentioned above show that they were, to a large extent, the administration's own choice.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and crude alternative, it seemed that he was unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I believed that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressures of future elections, would live up to the hopes we have heard for so long.
However, when Obama's approval rating dipped below 45 percent this week, it became much harder to return to 2008 through the book.
It makes me yeart for the many promises that have evaporated.
This week, I read that part of a book that describes how Clinton inflicted a resounding defeat on Obama in the Pennsylvania primary election.
At a meeting to analyze the reasons for the failure, he told his staff that they should get back on track and stay true to their goals.
"I want us to get our appeal back," he said.
"We must remember who we are."
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
Egypt takes oath of office of first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi takes the oath of office, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he took the oath of office, becoming the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the monarchy was overthrown some 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office in front of 18 judges in black robes in the courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life: absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer with an American background from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years has been a banned organization that has been a target for successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police when Morsi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11am local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to greet the new president, and unlike Mubarak's presidential pomp, traffic was stopped only briefly to allow his convoy to pass on the normally busy road connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi has been derided as the uncharistic "spare wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has skyrocketed since his victory and Friday's speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists but also for all those who want to end the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wood-panelled hall where he took the oath of office.
Morsi later headed to Cairo University, where he was to give his inaugural address.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra performing the national anthem, during which he stood on the rack "humblely".
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was greeted by the slogan "Army and people with one hand", chanted by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year began, and vowed to return the powers of the president, whom his office was stripped of by a military council that took action from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take a formal oath before the court, not to Parliament, as is customary, he is fulfilling the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Schools urged to pay more attention to maths, spelling and grammar
School english literature courses will require pupils to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction dating back to 1914.
The exam will also feature "non-programme texts" to encourage more extensive reading.
The Joint English Literature and Language course will be cancelled.
From 2015, pupils will be required to take a separate final language exam, with persistent recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department for Education is due to release new curriculums in English and maths tomorrow, the first subjects to be radicalised.
It will make changes to other major items next year.
Separately, the regulatory body in the field of exams OF'AL will present a revised structure of high school final exams, with a new system of assessments and a smaller volume of coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus that we must reform our exam system to regain public confidence," insisting that school finals would be "more complex, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time in maths (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year, while in Singapore pupils study about 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to the maths schedule, coalition sources said that large-scale school maths exams, combined with an increased coefficient in the rankings table, are likely to encourage schools to provide additional education in the subject.
The curriculum will focus more on "real-life tasks," including financial mathematics.
Is football the cause of the discord?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the "Open Tribune" politicians and experts talked about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals there was also such: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because from this game - only scandals and discord.
Speaker Sergey Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that in order to reduce the "degree of tension in society" politicians and the media should be correct in their statements.
Perhaps he was referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Jirinovsky, who in one of the TV shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire, if they do not want to limit the birth rate ...
All the speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from CIS countries, and about measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which gave the discussion a welter.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulev are "a model conflict that could be predicted", but "we have too many people and authorities responsible for these questions", and seven nannies have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has been practicing for migrants for a long time, according to the public, has failed, and it is necessary to find its way.
Historian Yuri Petrov placed high hopes on a new single history textbook.
"We still need to create a manual on the history of the culture of the country's peoples, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what people live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennadiy Syuganov proposed to criminalize "calls for the dismemberment of Russia": "If the U.S. says on the radio that you should give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Shchirinovsky tried very hard "not to inflame."
As usual, he blamed journalists who bring sick and acute national problems to the public debate: "In the heat of the debate, there is little to be said!"
The leader of the United Russia faction, Vladimir Vasilyev, immediately advised journalists to conclude a "charter" and agree to conduct conversations on this topic carefully, and then the same commitments can be made by politicians.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order as a whole is established, said Mr. Vasilyev.
As an example, he cited a law that held regional and municipal authorities responsible for international peace in their territories.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share her enthusiasm about this law: there are no "clear ideas about what is the adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and limits.
It means that the actors will interpret the scope of these powers in different ways.
In addition, municipalities do not have the personnel necessary to deal with such complex issues, do not have the means, and the methodical recommendations that they could use, the center does not give them ...
The head of the Duma Committee for Nationalities, Hajimet Safaraliyev, proposed the creation of a special agency with the formidable name "Ministry of National Security" that would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 90s headed a similar agency, abolished later, opposed.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, a "minister without a portfolio" to whom one could turn, if anything.
"We walk on the edge, shells are torn side by side, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to speak together against provocations, and this work should receive decent information support," said Vsevolod Chaplin, a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church for Public Relations.
In his opinion, there should be no neutrality of the state against dangerous ideologies, including religious ones.
Here Oleg Nilov led the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, still need to look, but they are pushed on the wrong path, on the wrong road," - he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football: "The footballer is beaten by the whole crowd, the flags burn, the comrades throw stones at each other ...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There is another sport - rugby is called...
"They will not be equal in the world in this sport!" - said the right-hand man fervently.
No one will play rugby in the Caucasus! - immediately intervened Mr. Jirinovsky.
You'll offer curling to them!
It is necessary to know the national features, it is like offering the Georgian "The Cossack" ...
In Yaroslavl, the wild behavior in the stands distinguished representatives of the Moscow club - during the game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
National Security Agency's Confessions Increase Corporate Paranoia Over Government Surveillance
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
According to the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence service, his mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. Mission building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to detect the antennas of the eavesdropping devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence, reiterated in September that the U.S. does not use foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of U.S. companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But ever since Edward Snowden , the contract employee-turned-whistleblower , began publishing his treasure trove of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company executives are no longer unsure whether the director can be taken by his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency had been monitoring Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers including Google and Yahoo have raised the paranoia of corporations caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last straw was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been tapped for perhaps about a decade.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, potential targets are business leaders.
Snowden made it apparent that there was intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies.
I think it is likely that this data is used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Grun, president of BITMi, a group that represents Germany's small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now poses almost as much risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
All the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, have so far been without evidence that the United States has transferred the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked some opportunities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical.
Someone in the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"It's not an option," said Gasso Plattner, president of The German business software provider SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
All but the IT industry.
And yet the reach and technical development of U.S. espionage agencies, made famous by the Snowden revelations, came as a shock to some companies that previously thought China posed the biggest risk of surveillance.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technology, where European CEOs have become more aware that data stored in the U.S. is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. members abandoned plans to use the services of a U.S.-based cloud provider after the revelation of the U.S. data mining program Prism.
Jim Sneib, one of SAP's executive directors, said: "We see consumers asking a new question that didn't arise a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that they will physically remain in that jurisdiction."
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are merely proof of what they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore this data must be protected at all costs.
It is not surprising that economic espionage is taking place.
It always took place.
"This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy," said Kurt Bock, chief executive officer of chemical company BASF.
Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, and we are also spying on them, because it is in our national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually don't like to brag about the retaliatory measures they've taken, as it can give an advantage to the enemy.
In large companies has long been learned the idea that to take a free flash drive at the exhibition or leave the laptop unattended in a hotel room - it is, to say the least, imprudent.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of The Audi, said it's standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so they can't be used as eavesdropping devices.
Germany's Federal Constitutional Protection Service recommends that ceos consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on overseas trips because of smartphone vulnerabilities.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the global market in their particular niche.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV report warns.
The U.S. warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Report in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second row of hackers for economic intelligence, after China, according to The Washington Post.
A board member of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Scarsini, the former head of France's domestic intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: "The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
Los Angeles International Airport was evacuated due to a shooting at one of the terminals.
An unidentified man opened fire in the third terminal at 09:30 local time on Friday, November 1 (20.30 GMT).
Security evacuated the staff and passengers of the second and third terminals.
According to preliminary information, the man was firing a high-power rifle.
Several people, including a U.S. Transportation Security Administration employee, were injured.
Police returned fire and detained the attacker.
He's slightly injured.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obied
Former NSW Labor minister Joe Tripodi will be involved in the state's anti-corruption watchdog investigation.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi denies making changes to the way in which seaside properties are leased at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obied, who secretly owned stakes in three properties on public land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obied lobbied several state ministers to extend leases on Sercillard Ki, where the Obiid family owns two restaurants and cafes, without a tender after their expiration in August 2005.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obied's clandestine involvement in the property, following testimony given by Mr Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynn Ashpol, on Thursday.
During several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be put up for an open competition.
Tenants were against this and also wanted longer lease terms.
In 2009, leases on The Sergiolar Ki, which brought the Obiid family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister for Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 until November 2009, initially advocated for open competitions.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obied, who Mr Tripodi acknowledged strongly advised changes to the Government's rental policy.
The transcript of the telephone conversations provided by ICAC included conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obied, Mr. Tripodi, and Steve Dunn, a senior official who joined the Port Authority after working under Mr. Obied in the fisheries department.
"Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations a question of commercial rental policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Merits...
"No," Mr. Tripodi replied. —
I can't remember what was discussed, but definitely it wasn't that.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obied.
UN Announces New Goals to End Poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals that were set out 12 years ago to overcome poverty around the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, before the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio the previous evening.
They were included in the final version of the document, which will be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit that now is the time to "get above the national interest."
"I am pleased that UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating universal sustainable development goals, the SDGs," he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will become an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to use the powers given to me by member countries to realize our vision of sustainable development goals, which are based on the success of the MDGs.
In the utility bills voronezh will appear a new line of expenses - deductions for the overhaul of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-bedroom apartment from the new year will have to pay more from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact standard will be determined by the regional government.
But when to paint the entrance, to put in order the stairwells or even to replace the elevator - it will be up to the tenants.
Such a law was approved by the deputies of the regional council.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "In this case, too, it is necessary to restore order - to establish the order of the repair of houses, to accumulate funds not in management companies - which we often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, somewhere else, it will be the establishment of state control over the expenditure of funds that are collected by residents to repair apartment buildings."
Under the control of the state now and equity construction.
The law protecting against fraudsters is approved by the regional council in the final reading.
The document was not born out of nowhere.
In our region, 4,500 people have been affected by dishonest developers.
The problems of the majority have been solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all participants in the equity construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that in this area, too, the abuses associated with the fact that in 98 the shareholders were the same, and in the 2000s the same shareholders."
People started to make money on this to close the loophole, including the adoption of these two laws.
Under Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary residence center for foreign nationals to be deported.
The regional parliament passed such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
Problems related to illegal migrants in the region at least spare.
Thus, last year a little more than 100,000 foreigners entered the migration register.
But only one in five has issued a formal work permit.
Where the rest work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
There is no court, but it is necessary to deport them - they must be kept somewhere.
The federation made such a decision that it would equip such places at the expense of regional funds.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is defined - it's Old Olshanka Semiluk district.
Well, finally, the regional parliament gave new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families with five or more children are completely exempt from the transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but the same amount of save and large parents.
Secondly, and this is most important, those who adopt 3 or more children, from the new year will be given subsidies for housing.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30,000 per meter.
Family, for example, of 6 people - father, mother, native child and 3rd - adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the state buys housing with an area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300,000 rubles.
For the left bank or the Southwest district - quite an acceptable option.
Well, and in the district center for this amount you can buy a whole cottage.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention releases recommendations for schools regarding children's allergies
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a list of recommendations for controlling food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one in 20 children in the U.S. has food allergies.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and attendants about children's food allergies and how to help with an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep supplies of adrenaline - most often used for injections - an automatic EpiPen medical syringe - to help with potentially lethal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently amended regulations to allow schools to stock up on adrenaline with less difficulty.
The notice also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children can say " it feels like something is poking in my tongue," "it feels like I have hair on my tongue" or "tongue pinches."
Kenyan press outraged by provocative media law
"This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for question: what can prevent the Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?" the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, the parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said the new media judiciary "will always be biased because it is an extension of government" and restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's standing in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies," he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially allow the government to "take the media with a dead grip," and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "got a serious blow" and criticized the bill as "draconian."
The bill's passage is part of measures taken to beef up national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media have angered authorities by broadcasting surveillance footage of troops sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting an expensive shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimayo's reaction was to summon two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was canceled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists could be fined up to one million with an additional risk of being "excluded from the lists", i.e. to obtain a ban on obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the violator if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM radio stations."
She also said that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called "vibrant blogosphere."
Politicians understand that by silenced the media, they will be able to do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," Wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of restraint and balancing forces in public life.
"Self-provided politicians will ruin the country and return us to hunting and gathering," he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to repeal cuts made by the National Wage Commission and restore their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings a month, one of the highest in the world.
Investigators check information about child abuse in Biysk
On 29 October, the media published a report that a kindergarten teacher in the town of Biysk had locked a child in a basement for educational purposes.
Investigators are currently investigating all the circumstances and giving a legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten staff.
After accusation of bad taste Evgeny Vasilyeva spoke
Evgenia Vasilyeva, whose person has been closely watched by the media for almost a year, has never commented on numerous publications in the press both about the thefts in the Ministry of Defense and about her personally - relations with former Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and her addiction to valuable things.
However, on November 1, the defendant in the Oboronservice case broke her silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasilyeva said: "Initially, of course, the task was exactly the same: to get out of me any negative information regarding the former minister of defense."
There was blackmail for me to testify, or I'd go to jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court, we will prove our innocence.
We are 100 percent sure of the victory.
At the same time, from the interview we can conclude that, perhaps, most of all Vasilyev was touched by the words that she had no taste.
Probably referring to the statement of the official representative of the SC of the Russian Federation Vladimir Markin that the collection of paintings, which was collected by the defendant of the case "Oboronservice", found forgeries.
Among the seized property there are a number of paintings, which the hostess, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art examination appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings has established that they have no artistic value and, quite simply, are cheap forgeries," Markin said in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defense...
Then they admitted that they had not been stolen from the Ministry of Defense, and said that I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
In my opinion, it's just a mess," Vasilyeva said.
Asked if she admits her guilt in any of the 12 alleged criminal episodes, Vasilyeva said: "Of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement of the SC of the Russian Federation that Vasilyeva evades the study of the materials of the criminal case, the lawyer of the defendant said that he and his client "the investigator is not allowed to familiarize himself with the materials of the case."
What was the reason for the revelations of Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest, who has not yet communicated with the press?
Perhaps as a woman she couldn't fail to respond to an accusation of bad taste?
Or are Komsomolskaya Pravda journalists right who claimed a couple of days ago that she "fell into an even greater trance under house arrest" because of news of Anatoly Serdyukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to the family?
Victor Baranets, a well-known military columnist for KP, wrote in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?" and wrote: "Investigators do not rule out that after such a shock she can become more talkative during interrogations."
Earlier Vasilyeva took on some charges of illegal sale of real estate of the Ministry of Defense.
Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the upcoming Italian league match against Parma.
According to Football Italia, the coaching staff decided not to include him in the application for the game to save before the match of the 4th round of the Champions League group stage with Real Madrid.
Lichtsteiner, Vucinic and Pepe will also not take part in the match against Parma.
And forward Fabio Cugliarella has recovered from injury and is ready to play.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact on Scotland from the HS2 rail project.
The HS2 project envisages the opening of high-speed links with Scotland and the north of England, with the start of the First Phase in 2026
Transport Secretary Baroness Kramer said the project would "unite the UK."
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was "delighted" with the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.
The first phase will be to build a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When stage two is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from 32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in the railway's capacity and shorter journey times for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the opportunity to cross the road from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our aim at HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make the UK and its cities closer together."
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about transporting cities to each other; Across the UK 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get the best message thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "High-speed rail has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scottish economic weight to the overall argument for high-speed rail across the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the UK Government to consider options for building a high-speed rail in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburgh rail line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
U.S. cuts food allowance for poor
Food allowance for a family of four decreases by $36 a month
Since Friday, the U.S. has been cutting financial security for food stamps, known as "food stamps," as the government's program ends.
A family of four will now be allocated $36 less per month for food benefits than before, officials say.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal year 2012, the allowance per person averaged $133 per month.
U.S. food aid spending has risen to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14 percent of Americans rely on free food aid issued by "foodsteps," which have been known since they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
But Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts to the program, saying it should be aimed at helping those who need it most.
Food store owners across America worry that the cuts will reduce consumer spending.
U.S. congressmen continue to argue about how much more government funding can be cut.
Due to the new rules imposed by russian customs, hundreds of trucks have been waiting in line for almost a week at the border with Russia.
Today Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install bio toilets
Hundreds of trucks have accumulated at border points at the entrance to Russia.
This situation arose because of the change in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the queue is created by the Russian side, which did not warn about the innovations in advance.
Since October 28, Russian customs authorities have been applying additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said Deputy Chief of Eastern Customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document is used in countries that have joined the Convention on International Transportation.
Checkpoints are operating in a reinforced mode.
The correspondent of "FACTOW" visited the border and talked with truckers who were hostages of the situation.
Prices in the roadside shop-cafe at the checkpoint "Novoazovsk" are growing every day, as well as the queue of trucks.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
The Customs Terminal Novoazovsk - Vesel-Vosnesenka provides one of the most important transport destinations from southern Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, the goods are sent to the Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia.
On Sunday before midnight they were allowed to run, and then these rules were introduced, - complains trucker Alexey Golovanov (pictured), who is transiting through Russia cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment of cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance to which it is carried.
Minimum insurance - 4.5-5 thousand rubles (about 1100-1300 hryvnia).
Those who travel nearby (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to 50,000 dollars, pay about 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnia) and pass.
And the rest are stuck - because no one has such big money with them!
Imagine, if the driver carries a cargo worth only four thousand dollars, but as far as Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnia) to pay for transit!
Conditions for survival at the border - no - lament truckers, arranged to eat near their cars.
In the border shops and cafes and so always expensive, but such prices as here, we have not met anywhere!
Sellers orientated and quickly inflated them: 15 hryvnia is a loaf, seven hryvnia - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnia - a plate of soup.
And the cafeteria is alone.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the toilet.
Neither wash nor shave...
I can stay out of the car for a week, my wife made me on the road.
I'll last a week," another trucker, Viktor Katorenko, consoles himself.
Is it going to be my car's turn in a week?
How much do you have a liter of water? - we are interested in the only border shop.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
Is the bottle crystal or the water infused with silver?
We have a coffee shop, not a shop.
Take it while there's something else," the saleswoman fends off.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the plight of Ukrainian drivers drew the attention of the authorities of the region.
The leadership of the Amvrosievskaya and Novoazov district administrations have been instructed to provide all those who are standing in line on the Ukrainian-Russian border with drinking water, - said the acting chairman of the Donetsk regional administration Sergei Dergunov.
Ambulance crews are currently on duty at the checkpoints.
Biotoilets will also be installed for the convenience of people.
According to the official, the problem related to queues will be solved in the coming days.
As of October 31, 32 and 68 cars were idle at the international checkpoints of Ouspenka and Novoazovsk, respectively.
FACTS will monitor the situation.
Sony expects lower annual profit
The Japanese electronics maker, Sony Corp., ended the previous quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, to cut its profit forecast for the current fiscal year.
Sony's results for the period from July to September 2013 were more depressing than expected, due to the drop in demand for televisions, video cameras and personal computers manufactured by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which delivered the company's first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years, fell again to 9.3 billion yen in operating loss in the second quarter.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through hard times, especially because of the decline in demand for televisions.
And while competitors are eager to find a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: here the company's sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which ends in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen in operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
Analysts had expected the figure to be much higher at 221 billion yen, according to Thomson Reuters data.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In the middle of this month, the start of sales of "smart" watches from the Japanese corporation, endowed with a number of fashionable features that will get rid of the need to get out of the pocket 100 times a day to get out of the pocket of the smartphone.
After Sony lowered its full-year profit and revenue forecast, the company's shares lost more than 11 percent in Tokyo this morning, falling to 1,668 yen per share.
How much do the late celebrities earn - MK in the USA MK
Madonna, who earned $125 million, was the highest-earning celebrity in 2013.
But it was "outdiled" by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
Notable lag behind him are other passed-up celebrities, who last year "earned" several times less.
The second most "wealthy" by the departed celebrities, compiled by Forbes magazine at the end of the year was Elvis Presley - 55 million for the year, and the line below the author of comics Peanuts Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition to them, the top five included Elizabeth Taylor, the former leader (25 million) last year, and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein were also on the list.
Eser proposes to equate to extremism insult patriotic feelings
In order to legislate the protection of patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults against Russia, "Just Russia" proposes to equate insulting patriotic feelings with extremist activities and punish five years in prison for it.
According to Izvestia newspaper, such amendments to the legislation prepared by the deputy chairman of the Duma Energy Committee, Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the government for an opinion.
By patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for this country, responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, in the domestic legislation there are sanctions for the abuse of the formal signs of state power - the flag and coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be hurt and insulted by state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect to our country, in Russian law is not sufficiently worked out.
As an example, he cites the annual debate on the eve of Victory Day, when some media personalities allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - every year unfolds a real bacchanalia.
Practicing in wit and "alternative view" of history, some publicists go to the reasoning that, say, it is a pity that the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I think this is absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual bond" of the nation," Oleg Mikheev indignantly.
In addition, according to Mikheev, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and insulting patriotic feelings can be almost with impunity.
According to the people's elected official, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to write in the 282nd article of the Criminal Code the appropriate punishment.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from 100,000 to 5-year imprisonment.
The influence of jailers will increase in the new compositions of public supervisory commissions
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new compositions of public supervisory commissions (ONC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, the lobbyists of the security forces will increase their influence.
The DNC is a public organization that monitors conditions of detention.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozhaev, the unrest in the penal colony - it is through the ONC that most high-profile incidents behind bars get publicized.
There is a struggle between human rights activists and lobbyists of the security forces for control of the DNC.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the DNC, I proposed to make the selection criterion an experience of human rights work.
"He was not accepted, and the lists were formed without developing the criteria," says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Supervisory Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, an all-Russian human rights organization dealing with prison problems.
When he was a member of the State Duma from Yabloko, he drafted a law regulating the activities of the ONC.
The GOP Council is to vote on the compositions of the DNC in 43 regions of the country.
Fewer than a thousand applicants are applying for 1,800 vacant seats, while in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkariya contests have not been able to organize due to the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize a donation for vacant seats.
Moscow's ONC is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that the new line-up will have 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borshchev, there are 11 human rights defenders and 9 law enforcement officers in the current composition of the capital's commission, and in the version, which is on the vote in the OP, the ratio varies by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights activists wanted to get into the capital commission.
On the other hand, Vyacheslav Kalinin, a representative of the "Fighting Brotherhood" may be re-entered into the new squad.
He was a member of the DNC for three years, but never visited the prisoners.
Borshchev believes that the security forces, appointing their chairman of the ONC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so human rights activists do not rule out a collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their opinion, the promotion of the security forces is coordinated by Anton Tsvetkov, a member of the ONC, who heads the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of law enforcement agencies.
"I don't eat babies for breakfast," Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies that he is lobbying for the promotion of any lists and says that he is not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested oppositionists.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in what list the GOP is now voting for.
He considers borshchev's disclosure of information a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is a planned change of leadership of the Chelyabinsk DNC.
Its former leaders will be suspended because of last year's spear unrest.
The Public Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
But the Rostov-on-Don ONC can move from human rights defenders to security forces.
From the new lists "disappeared" human rights defender-chairman of the local commission, but turned out to be one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber expelled him for unethical behavior.
Borshchev considers the lists of Moscow and Rostov commissions "revenge for Kopeisk."
Nadezhda Tolokonnikova's revelations did not affect Mordovia's ONC, which is considered "forceful": only one human rights defender wanted to get into the new squad, and she did not even accept the documents for the competition.
OP council member Nikolai Svanidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list because he resents the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to other members of the council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted in favor because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
Vladislav Gryb, Deputy Secretary of the OP, who is also an employee of the FSIN Research Institute, coordinated the compilation of onC lists.
Mushroom told RBC daily that he does not think it is right to divide candidates into human rights defenders and security forces and does not agree that the chairmen of the commissions have enough powers to prevent the work of its members.
Mushroom is not taken to predict the outcome of the GOP council vote.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a modified version will be put to a vote in the coming days.
Clive Palmer claims MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on parental leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on parental leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who has an unresolved dispute over a $6 million carbon tax, made the announcement as he sought to brush off questions about whether he had a conflict.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding whether to repeal carbon taxes and mining.
But Mr Palmer argued there could only be a conflict of interest for ministers and said Mr Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the policy.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they get leave or not," Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the seat of the Sunshine Coast constituency of Fairfax by a margin of 53 votes after the recount.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the electoral counting procedure to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should the decision on this election be taken two months after we voted?
"We need to have a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have such a system so that we can come in, put our data in your computer, vote right away and get the result at 6:30 p.m. that evening?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils for markings on the ballot paper.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
Using a pencil nowadays seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is exploring the possibilities for e-voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New ealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his program included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would be "very serious" about his new job.
Public office involves serving the community.
"We are not seeking any rewards other than gratitude for history for being able to serve this district at a critical time," he said.
Lawsuits over Nortel patents against Google, Samsung and Huawei
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, whose price was interrupted at a Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed patent infringement lawsuits in U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match Internet search keywords with their respective ads, the lawsuit says, which is the backbone of Google's search business.
Representatives for Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones running on Google's Android operating system, which fiercely competes with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering as much as $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in part a factor in the deal, and Motorola's patent library was partly the determining factor.
"Despite an unsuccessful attempt to acquire patents filed at auction, Google has violated and continues to violate them," the lawsuit says.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because it argues that Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the lawsuit.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22,000 spectators, noted the police officers, who were present today at the meeting of the FTC RFU.
The ticketing program is overstated, in their opinion, about twice.
During the match of the 1/16 final of the Russian Cup with Spartak, only a thousand stewards were involved under the regulatory norm of nine thousand.
Spartak fans were entitled to 2,200 seats, or 10 percent of the stadium capacity, but, according to the agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5,000 tickets.
This data was announced by the head of the FTC Artur Grigoryants.
Bird airlifted to safety from North Sea drilling rig released back into the wild
A bird washed ashore after it was found emaciated on an oil rig in the North Sea has been released back into the wild.
The water shepherd was placed in a helicopter bound for Aberdeen last month before being taken out by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at the Alloa Rescue Centre.
Centre manager Colin Seddon said: "This water shepherd is most likely a winter migrant from northern Europe who has fallen into a strong winds over the North Sea."
It seems that the bird was exhausted and was able to find refuge on the oil rig.
He added: "She wasn't able to take off again, so we were called for help."
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Fines for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will increase many times
According to the city authorities, the increase in fines will help to restore order in Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the products they sell are often not metable by appropriate sanitary control.
This means that the health of the vologians is being put at risk.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six-fold - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, the press service of the Vologda Administration reports.
In September, 600 people were dismissed from the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk.
As the trade unions say, all the dismissed received compensation.
However, the question of reducing industrial production in the region is much more acute than the problems of workers.
Aleksey Etmanov, deputy of the regional zaksa, said at the meeting that about 600 people had been cut at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk.
According to him, this happened in September: then under the program of voluntary dismissal, which was developed together with the union of the organization, about 600 people left the plant.
Workers who decided to resign of their own free will were offered "golden parachutes" in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority left their jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people - it's a whole night shift.
I don't think that's the end of the matter.
However, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programs to support regional enterprises in difficult situation in the next two years," he explained, adding that the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and large job cuts when adopting the budget.
Ford does not refute or confirm this information.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, be sure to publish it.
Talks about the reduction of workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company's plans to lay off 600 people became known in September.
Earlier, the plant announced the suspension of production of cars.
The reason for the plant was the drop in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, in the first nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in Lenoblast decreased by 5.4%.
Production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
Dmitry Medvedev: Russia's GDP growth rate is not enough for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the growth rate of its GDP insufficient for Russia and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
We planned this year's GDP growth in the region of 3%, maybe even a little more.
Realistically it will be just under 2%.
Against the background of the recession in a number of Countries in Europe it seems not very bad, but for us it is not enough, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be a higher rate.
Now it is very important that Russian companies and Russian businesses receive normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing to do," the head of the government said.
Director of Ugra Andrei Belmach noted that it is difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so I am not ready to say how long it will take to find a new coach," Belmach quotes ITAR-TASS as saying.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are exploring all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I want not just to find some coach, but such a person who will work at our club for several years and achieve certain results with him.
Snowboarder for Olympic bill specially photographed
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The denomination of the bill is 100 rubles.
But online bloggers are already actively ironic about the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on October 30, they noticed that the image of a snowboarder from the banknote can be found in photobanks.
In particular - in the free photo store StockExchange, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian mega-review website on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in advertising of RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic banknote is made in a blue-and-blue range.
On one side there is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other - a view of the Olympic stadium and a firebird.
The author of the banknote design is Pavel Bushuyev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named Repin.
The presentation noted that several sports - skiing, freestyle and ski jumping - were considered, but in the end they chose snowboarding because it is a relatively young sport.
According to a source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the public opinion regarding the widespread dissemination of the image of a snowboarder from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But in Goznak are not too concerned about the hype around the Olympic banknote.
Natalia Nikiforova, head of the press service of Gosznak, told Izvestia that all the arguments about plagiarism are ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote will turn to the right, in the photos in the net - to the left - Nikiforova said.
The man at the photo shoot to create the bill was filmed from different points, then the final image was chosen, on it - the characteristic pose of a snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist was paid for his work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is quite positive.
Recognition of the image on the bill is a plus for its promotion, - says Alexey Popovichev, executive director of RusBrand.
To prove the 100% similarity of images on the bill and in photobanks is quite difficult, so lawsuits to challenge the intellectual property on this image is unlikely to come.
The Olympic banknote first appeared in China - for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008, a commemorative banknote of 10 yuan was issued.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Sao Paulo Fashion Week.
She is considered not just a model in her homeland, but a real star.
Despite the fact that Gisele Bundshen left her job for a while, distracted by motherhood, these days and this week she came on purpose.
The multi-month absence did not prevent her from retaining her place on the podium and on the podium.
Giselle remains the highest paid supermodel in the world.
This time she participated in the fashion show of the brand "Kolcci."
The final of Fashion Week - usually the most interesting shows.
Like the one that the stylist Lino Villaventura organized.
Marche more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of pret-a-porter luxury, the fashion designer actively works in the theater and cinema, making performances and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 firms and companies related to the textile industry and the fashion world took part in the closing fashion week in Sao Paulo.
It is one of the fastest growing industries, employing more than 2 million Brazilians and producing annual turnover of $50 billion.
Driver who was driving at 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs has been fined £1,000
A motorist has been fined a total of £1,000 for driving at speeds of up to 130mph (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When police stopped him, they found a takeaway drink between his legs.
At Colchester Magistrates' Court, Howie admitted a charge of driving without due diligence and attention.
Adding seven demerit points to his driving licence resulted in him receiving a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of £90 and an additional fee to assist victims of crime in the amount of £100.
Pensions are being increased in Belarus since November
Pensions have been increasing in Belarus since November this year, BELTA correspondent was informed in the main department of pensions of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection.
From November 1 this year, the average wages of workers in the country will be adjusted, applied in the previous recalculation of pensions, with an increase of 5.4% and a corresponding recalculation of labor pensions in accordance with the decree of October 21, 2013 No.478 "On the increase in pensions."
As a result of the recalculation, the age pension will increase by an average of 5.3% from November.
The average age pension will be Br2 million 295 thousand.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million residents of the republic.
Spending of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November this year will increase by Br274.3 billion per month.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of labour pensions in November this year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and co-payments to pensions will be recalculated in connection with the increase in the subsistence budget on average per capita.
BPM for the period from November 1, 2013 to January 31, 2014 approved by the government in the amount of Br1 million 47 thousand 530 - 2.1% higher than the one in force between August 1 and October 31.
Accordingly, the minimum labour pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and co-payments to pensions will be increased by 2.1% from November 1.
More than Br53 trillion has been pledged in Belarus for pensions in 2013, taking into account the increases.
NSA blames 'internal error' not hackers for site shutdown
The undercover National Security Agency said Friday night that shutting down their site for several hours caused a technical glitch, not hackers, as alleged online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update," the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service attack are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems reported that the NSA site had not worked for at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's internal secret network "was not" hacked.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one online group of hacker activists said it was responsible for disabling the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site fails.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly top-secret NSA, once nicknamed "No Such Agency," has come under public scrutiny and fierce criticism in recent months after a string of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and at home - all a reaction to classified NSA files stolen from the agency and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has prompted speculation that today's incident was the result of targeted hacking.
Gazprom Chief Alexei Miller Says Pipeline in Bulgaria Marks New Era in Gas Industry
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom has said.
"Today there was a significant event: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
A dispute over a contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which houses much of Russia's Gas for Europe, increases the risk level for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said that a direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated "forever."
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The pipeline's annual project capacity is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Agency "Rosbalt" deprived of media status for swearing
On October 31, the Moscow City Court decided to invalidate the registration license of the agency "Rosbalt" - Lenta writes.
Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of media status for systematic and gross violations of the law on mass media.
During the trial, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, effectively denying the publication the right to put forward counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
The Rosbalt News Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has offices in the former Soviet Union.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was one of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, "Rosbalt" has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of exclusive publications of the agency were (and still make up) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the proximity of the publication to the security forces continued throughout the existence of the agency.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive database of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions was said by the fact that the project was headed by Natalia Chaplina - the wife of Viktor Cherkesov.
At the same time, Chaplin's role in the management of "Rosbalt" is not completely clear: most often it is called "project manager".
The director general of the agency is Larissa Afonina, the editor-in-chief is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, "Rosbalt" did not appear in the ratings of the federal media - neither by citation, nor by audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the ranking of attendance sites of Russian media according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials for the last five months - notes about the kremlin's helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the lead singer of the group "King and jester", pogroms in the capital Biryulev.
Rosbalt's conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the law on mass media came into force, banning journalists from swearing.
The agency found the banned vocabulary in two videos published on the agency's website ("Jigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot desecrated oil rigs").
Further sides describe in different ways.
Roskomnadzor on the basis of the discovered videos accused "Rosbalt" of gross and systematic violation of the law on mass media and appealed to the court with a demand to take away the agency's license.
"Rosbalt" stated that the claims of the agency are wrong: first, the videos were not editorial materials, secondly, the mother words in them were disguised, and, thirdly, immediately after the warning the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed Roskomnadzor's claims to the world court - and when the Moscow City Court accepted Roskomnadzor's claim on October 22, 2013, the consideration of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, on the 25th the magistrate decided not in favor of "Rosbalt": editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code on administrative offenses and fined 20,000 rubles - 10,000 for each video.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow City Court - if we abandon the idea that the outcome could have been a foregone conclusion even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to invalidate Rosbalt's registration certificate, effectively depriving the agency of media status.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt was left alone during this confrontation.
The agency was supported by the State Duma deputies (the statement to the head of Roskomnadzor, Aleksandr Sharov, was signed by 26 deputies on October 10; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the Communist Party).
The head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Human Rights Council Mikhail Fedotov claimed that the closure of the newspaper was illegal.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even provided him with some guarantees that it would not come to the revocation of the license.
The trial of Rosbalt showed that under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be the media in Russia today - a big question.
Speech gene turned out to be a stimulant of synapses formation
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School have discovered a protein that allows Foxp2's "speech gene" to function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and the journal's website can read its brief content.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known genome whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce the words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
Scientists found that the Foxp2 gene was disrupted, but it was not known how it performs its function.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of its functions as Foxp2 performs as a stimulant for the formation of new synapses in the area of the brain associated with speech formation.
It does this thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered by searching for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, with Only Foxp2 shining on its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 does affect vocalization, scientists confirmed in the experiment on mice.
When the animal's gene activity was artificially reduced, they were less screaming when separating from their mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of sounds was also restored.
Earlier in the mouse was also shown a connection with the vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals that were injected with a human copy of the gene were squeaked more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, the controlled SRPX2 with purely "mechanical" properties of sound formation or more subtle processes.
Ponomarev left "Just Russia"
Ilya Ponomarev, a member of the State Duma from the Just Russia party and a member of its branch in Novosibirsk, has applied to leave the political organization.
According to the mp, he submitted the application to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the "right-wingers."
We sit, drink tea...
"For some reason, many people want to see the picture "Ilya Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table," but there is nothing so epochal in this," the MP commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the Esers.
Meanwhile, Ilya Ponomarev, a State Duma deputy, is not going to relinquish his mandate.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and by law can not withdraw from it.
Reports about Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the party "Just Russia" appeared on October 30.
It was reported that Dmitry Gudkov and Valeriy zubov would leave the SR with him, but the latter soon refuted this information.
Want a glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a sea animal to develop glowing food.
He came up with this idea after reading a scientific article about jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the language of the one who eats it, raising the pH level in the protein and causing it to glow.
Chris says that because the ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lisni me, I'm delicious", says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still at the very beginning, when it comes to production, so for 200 you get about 2 grams of matter."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, it will increase pH levels and the ice cream will start to glow.
We've been testing it for the last few months and it seemed like it would be perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because luminescence jellyfish are four times more expensive than gold.
So each balloon costs me about £140.
But it tastes pretty pleasant.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
It's by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do that.
Ice cream uses fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
GM recalls a number of new pickup trucks in the U.S. to refine seat backs
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickup trucks to fix problems with manual adjustment of seat tilts, according to a notice released Friday from U.S. transportation safety regulators.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the back tilt mechanism.
As a result, seat backs do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"When a car is hit from behind, the headrest may not adequately protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury," the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement posted on its website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
The release of GM pickup trucks began in June and represents the most important launch of the car into mass production for the leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed pickup truck owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not consider notifying owners of the government's 16-day shutdown, which boosted car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, which were upgraded for the 2014 lineup, rose about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
A pedestrian zone was opened in the tretyakov gallery area
A new pedestrian zone has appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the Tretyakov Gallery area and occupies a two-kilometer stretch from the Novokuznetskaya metro station to Bolotnaya Square.
Street floor lamps, flower beds, benches, urns and toilets are installed all over the whole, blank fences and illegal advertising have been removed.
In addition to Klimentovsky and Lavrushinsky lanes, which were already pedestrian, five streets - Ordynsky cul-de-sac, Big and Small Tolmachevsky lanes, Kadashevskaya embankment and Bolotnaya Square - were closed for cars.
Traffic on the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka is not limited.
On the section of Pyatnitskaya Street from the vestibule of the station "Novokuznetskaya" to Klimentovskaya Lane conditions for pedestrians created without removing traffic and cutting the roadway, reports newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the temple of the Holy Martyr Clement of the Pope, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, Tverskaya Passage, Stoleshnikov Lane and Kuznetsky Bridge were completely pedestrian.
The great Dimitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
On the club's official website, the fans of the club recognized the former captain of the Russian national team as the best player of the past month.
In October, Arshavin took part in two matches of the UEFA Champions League group stage, three meetings of the Russian championship and a cup match.
He has two assists.
The second place at the end of the month went to goalkeeper Yuri Lodygin, who became the best player of August and September.
In third position - hulk striker.
The Brazilian has two goals and three assists.
It should be reminded that Arshavin has returned to the club this summer.
"Art-mainstream" premiere series will be held in Moscow
A series of film screenings of "Art-mainstream" where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held in the cinema "Roland" from November 1 to 5, RIA Novosti reports, citing the organizers of the project.
The French comedy "Paris at all costs" will open the program "Art-mainstream".
This is the story of the model Maya (Kerchi herself) working in the French capital, who is deported to her home country of Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, viewers will also be shown a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-Duk's "Mebius", Oliver Hirschbigel's melodramatic biopic "Diana: A Love Story" (Diana) starring Naomi Watts and the main film of the Cannes Film Festival's "The Life of Adele" by Abdelatif Keshis.
The only Russian participant of "Art-mainstream" will be the winning film "Geyographer Globe" based on the novel of the same name by Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - a charming loser-teacher Victor Sluzhkin - in the film played by Konstantin Habensky, whose work was also awarded the prize "Kinotavr."
Snowden ready to 'cooperate' with Germany on US intelligence
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence whistleblower, has said he is willing to travel to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, fail to answer questions about their activities.
German lawmaker Hans-Christian Strebele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "While the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that give no protection."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed the international community's support could persuade the US government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany's interior minister, told zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make that possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have become tense following allegations that the NSA wiretapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, an MP who heads a parliamentary group overseeing the intelligence service, said that if there was an opportunity to listen to Mr Snowden as a witness " without putting him in danger or destroying relations with the US completely," it should be used.
Mr. Strebele, a Green Party MP for Germany, posted a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strebele said that according to a lawyer for a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be there "safe," the MP said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he faced a "tough and sustained" campaign of harassment that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to "his political statements."
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials, including those in the United States, found exposing an uncontrolled system of pervasive surveillance useful to society.
The letter offers to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
Foreign workers on 457 sub-class visas can be tested for 'authenticity'
The "authenticity" test for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under consideration by the Government as it plans to expand repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied on criteria to prevent the use of Class 457 visas to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole for the transfer of family and friends to Australia.
The government's submission to the paper was published today, while former Labor MP Maxine McCue criticised the government's rhetoric on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"Loud statements like "foreigners at the end of the queue" and "first jobs to Australians" represent a very nasty throwback to the days when unions demanded a protected labour market," she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of this historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The paper sets out 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to meet with officials about people smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes and the rest are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criteria are adopted, the visa applicant can be investigated to determine whether the nominee is genuine in an environment where the candidate is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person involved in the financing of the enterprise."
Businesses may also be required to report on the number of visa holders under class 457, as previously enterprises intending to sponsor a small number of employees then hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of an alleged heart attack after arriving by boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man's heartbroken nine-year-old son accompanied him on his way to Australia and has been supported by a cousin who was also on board since his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities hastily sent the man to a Christmas Island hospital where he died.
The head coach of "Colorado" Patrick Roy, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semyon Varlamov from the first minutes of Friday's match against Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas sobkor "SE" Natalia Shmeleva.
And what can we expect," Rua said after the avalanche morning.
Of course, what happened to us all worries, but we are confident in him and feel that it will be useful for him to go out on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you are completely sure that the situation did not affect the goalkeeper's condition in any way?
We'll see today.
Undoubtedly our players will support Varley by helping him to keep the goal, as it was in the previous matches of this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to draw any conclusions until the court understands this situation.
Baumgertner nominated to Uralkali's board of directors
The current board of directors of Uralkali has proposed the candidacy of Vladislav Baumgertner, the director general arrested in Minsk, to the new board, according to the website of the Russian company.
Bamumertner was included in the list of 11 people nominated to the new board of directors.
This list was prepared for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on November 29, at which the new composition of the board of directors will be determined by a vote.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
When he was detained in August this year, he was charged with abuse of office.
However, later president of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko said at a press conference that Baumgertner's accusations were reclassified as "theft".
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure of Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
A stand-by loan is being negotiated with the IMF, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
At the same time, in addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF can overcome long-standing differences over financing terms.
He does not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to receive aid, and the international rating agency S.P., which lowered on Friday the sovereign rating of Ukraine by one notch - to "B-" with "B."
However, EU representatives say that the IMF can show flexibility in the terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the plan of financial support of the country, the EU has a reserve option to provide Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of which is now coming from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from the "Northern Stream" or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in case Russia "isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse deliveries to Ukraine can be used only for a few weeks, and is likely to lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
"Negotiations are underway between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," the source added to Reuters.

In the U.S., you can use mobile during takeoff and landing
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during the take-off and landing of an airliner have been approved in the United States, the BBC reports.
U.S. airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, with the new rules effective by the end of 2013.
However, internet communication to receive and send e-mail will be prohibited during flights below 3 kilometers.
Due to the risk of interference with aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communication will continue to be prohibited.
Thus, passengers of flights will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of electronic devices throughout the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile aircraft and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, following the example of the United States, in Britain may also be revised the current rules for the use of electronic devices in flights.
Running on the field in the match "Shinnik"
Some details have become known about the identity of the fan who ran onto the pitch during the match 1/16 of the Russian Cup final between Yaroslavl Shinnik and Spartak Moscow.
According to artur Grigoryants, head of the FTC, referring to the data of the Interior Ministry, this fan is a Muscovite.
He is currently in custody.
"In addition, Grigoryants told about how the fan managed to break through on the field: "It turned out that this one, let's call him a spectator, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, citing heart problems.
He went to the ambulance - it was confirmed to us by the doctor of the ambulance.
And then he pushed away the two attendants and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the East and South stands to the corner of the East and North Stands.
He ran across the field.
The stewards are responsible for this.
Before the sports law comes into force, it is the area of action of stewards - the police can not interfere with what is on the field.
He ran to the podium, climbed over the East Stand.
And at that time riots broke out on the Eastern Tribune and on treadmills," the head of the FTC said.
We remind that by the decision of the KDK, Moscow's Spartak will hold the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian championship against Lokomotiv and zenith without spectators, as well as pay a fine of 600,000 rubles.

Americans eavesdropped on Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, a U.S. intelligence official, who chose not to reveal his name, said that the United States had eavesdropped on the phone conversations of senior Japanese officials.
This person confirmed that in the land of the rising sun there are several points intended for listening.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, this happened during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, as well as Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are targets for intelligence activities, NHK reported.
Officially, neither side has commented on this information.
Recall, the news about the surveillance of the U.S. intelligence services for the German Chancellor appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA may have been tapping Merkel's phone for the past ten years.
The Chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her wiretapping very painfully.
She said that what she saw as Germany and the United States for decades, such surveillance of the head of government was unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was willing to share details about Angela Merkel's wiretapping with German prosecutors.
The German specially flew to Moscow to meet with a former CIA officer.
Scandalous video hit the police
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly reckless antics, caught smoking crack.
Police in the Canadian city said they had the video and were ready to launch an investigation against the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reported.
Information that authorities have evidence of Drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto Police website.
The head of local law enforcement, Bill Blair, held a press conference on the matter.
The sheriff said he was not authorized to share the footage with the public, but he vouched for their existence.
According to Blair, the compromising Rob Ford video was discovered during an anti-drug raid carried out by security guards in the summer of 2013.
The existence of this video has previously been reported by the Canadian press, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself does not give any comments on this matter.
He only says that he is innocent and is not going to resign.
The video, which was discovered by police, is one of the evidence in the case of Ford's 35-year-old friend Alexander Lisi, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, obtaining illegal proceeds, and criminal conspiracy.
At times, Leesie served as Rob Ford's driver.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public drunk, allowed himself racist and sexist remarks.
Diana Arbenina Celebrates Halloween with Her Children
Diana Arbenina does not hide what great pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Despite the fact that right now Arbenina especially devotes a lot of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds an opportunity to tinker with Martha and Artem, and not only spends time on their training, but also entertains as much as she can.
Over the past week, Diana has twice reported to her fans about her pedagogical talents.
She first posted a photo on Facebook showing her teaching children to read.
And yesterday pampered the fans, showing how dressed Artem and Martha for Halloween.
Ready to race on broomsticks! our first halloween" - so Diana called a photo of her children dressed in festive costumes.
Which is no wonder, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, have to do with this holiday, because they were born in America.
An earthquake of magnitude 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, near the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, Reuters reported.
The quake was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers southwest of the city, according to the website of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The tremors were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1 in Moscow).
No casualties or tremors have been reported so far.
Recall, Chile is in one of the most seismically active areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of varying strength there are not uncommon.
One of the most serious occurred in 2010.
The 8.8 magnitude earthquake and tsunami caused by the tsunami killed more than 550 people in Chile and destroyed 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960, there was recorded a magnitude of 9.5.
More than 5,000 people died as a result of that disaster.
Rostovaeroinvest has recognized the German company Assmann Beraten and Planen as the winner of the tender for the choice of the general designer of the object.
The amount of the contract in Rostovaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the press service of the JSC, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, under the terms of the tender the project should be prepared and sent for state examination in the spring of 2014.
The winner will design a new airport passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and elements of airport improvement.
In the first stage of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50,000 square meters, in the future it is possible to increase it.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender was finalized, the architectural concept of the Southern airport complex, developed by the British company Twelve Architects, was defined.
The project of the main terminal building embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities around the world.
Assmann Beraten and Planen has experience in implementing major projects, the company has designed terminals C and E of Sheremetyevo International Airport and a new airport complex at Knevichi International Airport in Vladivostok.
The International Airport Complex "Southern" will be built in the Aksai district of rostov region and will replace the existing Rostov airport, which will be closed and in the future integrated into urban development.
Construction of the airport complex is scheduled to begin in 2014, and the commissioning of all facilities is scheduled for 2017.
Italian workers with experience give way to young
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
Data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country's residents are now out of work.
It hasn't been that bad since World War II.
Among the young, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of residents aged 15 to 24 are un employment-free.
According to the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
This experiment is already being carried out by the country's largest energy company, and the laws adopted allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early pension for employees with seniority.
However, on the other hand, Italy is waiting for the common problem for Europe of an ageing population.
And economists aren't sure that the idea of premature rotation of personnel will pay off.
Syria destroys chemical weapons equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has acknowledged.
This first phase of disarmament was completed by Damascus a day before the deadline.
Until November 1, Syria was to destroy production and other support facilities designed to prepare combat poisons for use, the BBC reports.
The destruction of the stockpiles of poisons or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the OPCW representative, the poisonous substances are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent their repair.
The next milestone is mid-November: by which time the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy existing stockpiles of poisonous substances.
There are a lot of questions.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be scrutinized by Western intelligence services.
They will readily advise inspectors of new facilities for inspection if there is reason to suspect that Damascus is not completely frank.
The U.S. believes that this shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of Syrian rebels.
The international community demanded that the Syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement reached with the mediation of Russia - destroy or bring to an off-duty state all the capacity for the production of shells, poison gases and liquids and to fill the shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has passed, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already available to the Syrian army.
It is estimated that this arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, skin-in-the-black mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
To destroy it, it is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities first agree on a timetable for action - this is a two-week plan.
The head of OPCW field operations, Gerry Smith, told the BBC that its inspectors had "personally monitored the destruction of equipment."
"They no longer have the ability to further produce or mix chemical weapons," he said.
The OPCW said in a statement that inspectors had visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and had seen that the shell and poison plants had either been destroyed or rendered unusable.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to carry out inspections there, the document says, but the equipment was transported and inspected by OPCW specialists.
Smith said the process of destroying the chemical weapons infrastructure was "particularly difficult" as it was ongoing to work in the face of ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW won the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said there was no time for the inspectors to celebrate - they were too busy working.
George Kerevan: Break with Europe gives Scots choice
Another day, another horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition of EU membership.
It is a series of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along the Hadrian's shaft.
However, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of freer travel across the rest of Europe, although - predictably - it did not make headlines.
Nor has anyone pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time turning their formal rules in the way they are comfortable.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, continued non-compliance will be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for what it really wanted from the Scots.
So it's not a noteworthy story.
And so old that it turned into a fossil: I first heard a "duck" that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment lost in the retelling of an old fairy tale.
Why should an independent Scotland comply with the orders of Europe?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great postwar plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the European crisis, the "Europe" project is officially dead.
Across the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party - founded only this year - came out of nowhere and won nearly five million votes in September's federal election, effectively ousting the Free Democrats (similar to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been internal opposition to the plan for the creation of a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has been a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency, have led many people to believe that the "Europe" project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments operate with excessive budget deficits - this was only true for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members on exchange rates favorable to German exporters - which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe finds itself at a predetermined disadvantage in terms of production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only saving means is to cut salaries and government spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current problems of the budget and currency is a deeper problem of Europe's productive abilities.
As a result of a set of green energy measures introduced by Brussels - a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the United States.
This is a paralyzingly unfavourable price environment, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
No wage freeze in the world will stop the crushing victory of cheap US shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, a revolt is brewing, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France's shattered economy in distress.
The result is that Marine Le Pen's anti-EU National Front party has just won a crucial by-election, dropping the ruling Socialist Party into third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that there is no suggestion that a split among the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use next year's EU elections to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If - and this is very likely - anti-EU parties gain support in this election, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Here is my opinion: soon the growing mood against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something of a vague "Europe (sovereign) nation" that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
Nevertheless, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that the UK will be left unattended in the cold Atlantic.
In what position does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed under a freer European agreement provided that we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway's experience and maintaining our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which won an impressive majority in 2011 thanks to objections to spending cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of the Tories and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ludicrous for Scotland to vote for independence now just to adopt the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Australian woman appeals against jail term in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in Phuket prison for falsely claiming she was attacked by a taxi driver has appealed her sentence and has been released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by the Phuket Provincial Court on 15 June of filing a false claim following a report by Thai police that a local taxi driver carried out the attack on the night of Sunday 10 June while two other men were holding her.
However, CCTV footage later revealed she had returned safely to her hotel after severing her relationship with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
Prior to the trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a general detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than an adult prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who has contacted the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" for their daughter's welfare and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
"Obviously it was an alarming time, but we hope she will return home safely as soon as possible," Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently holidaying in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Thai legal sources said Bamford was currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to the court extending her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve time in an adult prison.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its tarnished tourist image, leading to acquittal.

Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the government authorities of the two countries will provide universal assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts among themselves," said Vladimir Makei.
He stressed that the government of Belarus will create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The minister also said that another 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic commission was held in Ankara, the results of which the protocol was signed.

"The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners," he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, said that at the talks the foreign ministers of the two countries decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
According to the minister, the trade turnover between Belarus and Turkey should be increased and brought to the level of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the field of investment cooperation, which should be further developed, as there is unusilished potential in this area, he believes.

The first worked in the Industrial District on The Street Of Take-off.
At the time of the inspection, the institution was playing a game.
The club counted 24 assault rifles.
Another gaming club was found in the Leninsky district on Anton Petrov Street.
20 slot machines were used here.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on Barnaul reports that administrative materials under the article "Illegal organization and conduct of gambling" have been drawn up.

Motor schools will be able to conduct driving exams
Exams for driver's licenses will be able to take private companies that have their own computerized racetrack.
Kommersant writes about it with reference to the draft resolution of the government "On the admission to driving vehicles."
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such racetracks in Russia.
It is expected that students of such "privileged" driving schools will be counted the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Automobile Inspectorate will monitor the exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the exams on theory and more than 20% of the site students do not pass the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for the racetrack contained in the draft government resolution come into force on November 5, 2014.
The project also contains requirements for learning to drive two-wheeled vehicles.
From January 1, 2015, motorcycle owners will have to take an exam in urban traffic in order to obtain category A rights.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire drivers of foreigners with foreign rights.
Such workers will be required to obtain Russian rights after passing the exam.
Early puberty: aging earlier
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame
Experts believe the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be frightened if her daughter begins to form breast rudiments and grow pubic hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics' annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents - it doesn't usually mean that full puberty is fast," Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and down from 12.75 in 1970.
"After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two to three years to menarche," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: How to Cope With This Common Problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
Discussions are under way about what constitutes actual puberty, but is considered "premature" when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or pause - something that the pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progression may be grounds for analysis by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to slower growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, development level, growth rates and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplovitz is careful with medications, but admits that "suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls' feelings that they are different from their peers."
Another big problem is clear: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they're going to handle hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman, whose daughter started menstruating when she was 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first among her friends.
There are many advertised theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
In boys - as in girls - puberty comes earlier.
Kaplovitz argues that the premise that weighs the most is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls aged 6 to 9, which links the amount of fat in the body with puberty.
Other evidence supports this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Worldwide, early puberty is likely to be influenced by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys have facial and pubic hair appearing at a younger age, the trend towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair occurs even in infants and toddlers.
"We have to be careful about how we define true puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Gorieb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive guidance from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This could mean an earlier-than-expected conversation," Kaplovitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who bloom early need confirmation that even when it happens earlier than expected, this process is a normal part of life.
The head of Dagestan can be heard in the anthem of Kuban notes of extremism
The football match between Anzhi and Kubanya resulted in a political conflict between the authorities of Krasnodar region and Dagestan after fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the anthem of Kuban sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan, Ramadan Abdulatipov, on Thursday invited republican parliamentarians to go to court, because the anthem of the Krasnodar region allegedly calls for ethnic strife, in particular, calls for war with "basurmans."
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar region, it is in our time in 1995 approved this anthem.
It's a disgrace, and no one's doing it.
"I remember you here as a mother of your native, on the enemy, on basurmanin we go to the mortal battle" - for which such words to write in the national anthem, to poison some believers on other believers, "- expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov The chairman of the parliament Khizri Shikhsaidov.
RBS suspends two currency traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division, according to two people familiar with the situation, further confirming that global regulators are investigating alleged currency market manipulation.
Some of the world's biggest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are cooperating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
The two traders will be the first RBS employees suspended in the unfolding investigation, which echoes the LIBOR interbank rate manipulation scandal.
Refusing to comment on the suspension, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
"Our ongoing investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, whistleblowers said RBS had handed over email and instant messages it had received and sent to its former trader, the UK's regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as is understood, he was granted leave in his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders has been charged with any wrongdoing.
Mr. Usher's instant messaging team included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to whistleblowers.
UBS Bank said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators around the world - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's antitrust authority Weko, fca, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are reviewing allegations that bankers colluded to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal audits or received requests for information from regulators, officials familiar with the situation said.
Banks have been reviewing instant messages and emails for years in search of wrongdoing.
News of the audits has stirred up traders in the sector of activity, which in recent years has been one of the largest sources of income of trading divisions of investment banks, which this year, however, faced difficulties because low currency volatility reduces favorable opportunities for resellers.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the gravity of the situation, saying that the vast and highly liquid currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading in the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use by banks of their internal platforms means that "you can start to influence the market at a very small price".
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired one of its stock trading backers on the London Stock Exchange this week after it caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this matter has been localized," Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama's landmark health care law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By voting 5 to 4, the justices ruled that separate executive orders under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requiring citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine are constitutional under the government's tax authority.
Supreme Court Chairman John Roberts joined four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were against.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law and went on to say that the health law's requirement that states improve Medicaid eligibility, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for Medicaid, was not unconstitutionally coercive.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business filed a lawsuit to block the bill.
Each of the major Republican presidential candidates opposed the law during the 2012 primary election season, including presumptive nominee Mitt Romney.

Now only one in five Russians (20%).
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 almost a third of citizens (31%).
It should be reminded that three years ago on December 11, a spontaneous rally of nationalists took place on Manezh square, which turned into riots.
Levada Center also asked Russians about what kind of holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (People's Unity Day) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of citizens are going to celebrate this holiday.

Snowden says ready to talk to German authorities on wiretapping case
Former CIA officer Edward Snowden expresses readiness to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with representatives of the German authorities, RIA Novosti reports.
The letter of the former CIA officer to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by the deputy of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele, through which Snowden passed the message to the German authorities.
Strebel met Snowden in Moscow the day before.
Today, it is not the number of available health facilities and their status that matters to the population, but the quality of medical care provided.
Implementation of the program "Modernization of health care of the Tula region for 2011 - 2013," the reorganization of medical institutions of our city will create an optimal structure of medical care for the population, including gynaecological patients, pregnant women and women in labor.
Thus, after the merger with the hospital, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the NGKB hospital for consultations of pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the logistics of the maternity hospital was significantly improved, and modern equipment was created that met world standards.
Over the years, about 8 million rubles have been allocated for the overhaul of the premises, 112 pieces of equipment worth 42 million rubles have been purchased.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
The operating room uses a "Sell-Saver" device to collect blood from the operating wound and return it to the mother, avoiding transfusions of foreign blood.
The department of clinical and laboratory diagnostics is also equipped with modern equipment.
The women's clinic has an electronic registry, and electronic maps and patient medical histories are planned in the near future.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it was possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, women and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
The natives of Chechnya have been arrested by French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been underway since March this year.

The leader of the gang was a 27-year-old formerly convicted native of Chechnya.
Venezuela to set exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency - bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on November 1, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange sums equivalent to ten thousand U.S. dollars in a year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
The Minister of Petroleum Industry and Vice President for Economics Rafael Ramirez said on October 18 that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial information cited by the agency, Caracas may still decide to depreciate the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
Policies to contain the prices of products and consumer goods, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, have led to shortages of a number of goods and the functioning of the black exchange market.
In the spring of this year, the media wrote that Venezuela had a shortage of toilet paper.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that US espionage 'went unsuitablely far'
John Kerry has demonstrated a softening of U.S. surveillance tactics, making an unprecedented admission that in some cases U.S. espionage "has gone unsuitablely far."
The secretary of state also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being "on autopilot" during the appearance of Edward Snowden's high-profile revelations about NSA espionage.
These leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic row with its allies.
Speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said, "There is no doubt that the president and I, and other members of the government, actually took some of the things happening on autopilot, because that opportunity already existed, both during World War II and the very difficult years of the Cold War, and of course 9/11."
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said: "In some cases it went unsuitablely far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain himself to the people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted out of good intentions and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented planes crashing, building explosions and killing people because we were able to find out about these plans in advance."
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. espionage abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said On Thursday.
Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said he spoke with members of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because of frustration with the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It's really important for U.S. national security interests that Europeans remain our supporters of our overall anti-terrorism efforts," said Democrat Murphy, who is a first-term first-term chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
"And I'm going to Europe to make them realize that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger about these NSA programs."
News that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the U.S.
Other revelations cited Snowden's release of documents showing that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended spying on allies as necessary and said it was commonplace on both sides.
Amid the hype, Murphy said his office would organize a congressional trip that is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating lawmakers are due to be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still under development.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said there would also be some "hardness of the best motives.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people about what spyware they themselves have used for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to accept the fact that we're not the only ones doing intelligence," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is due to head to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address concerns of hostility to the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence.
In the U.S., the school principal fired at the teenagers.
The principals of one of the American high schools teenagers literally drove to despair.
The man, he said, had to take his weapon and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, young hooligans threw toilet paper at the man's house.
As a result, the school principal opened fire on the teenagers, resulting in several wounds to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
As the hooligans were not on the property of the director, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from prison on bail of $125,000.
Note, shooting at civilians in the U.S. becomes a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in the center of Ridgecrest in the U.S. state of California right on passers-by in the street.
The offender then took two bystanders hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier, a shooting occurred at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.
Adam's mother worked at the school, she was a teacher.

Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.
Chinese newspaper that published the appeal "should be reorganized"
A Chinese newspaper that published a front page call for the release of a reporter accused of defamation should be reorganized, according to the press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with a public ownership stake.
Now New Express must go through a "process of complete error correction," according to the regulator.
The order to "fix the bugs" came from the Guangdong Office in the sphere of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group newspaper New Express published several false reports about the exchange-registered company, zoomlion, between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The management of the editorial board of the New Express was disoriented," the regulator said in a statement.
He reports that the decision was made "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of the revocation of his reporter's license."
He also "directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the bugs at the New Express and recommended that it investigate the newspaper's responsible persons and make immediate changes to the management of the New Express."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express alleging financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page, saying that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr Chen then appeared on state television acknowledging that he had published false articles for money.
"In this case, I have done damage to the company, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn the trust of the public," he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I craved money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
Following Mr. Chen's confessions, the New Express issued an apology on the front page, saying the newspaper had failed to properly verify his reporting.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say the practice of extracting confessions in China is still ubiquitous, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting authorities from forcing someone to self-incriminate.
Several schools and a hospital had to be closed due to a rampage of evil forces
Four schools in south Matabeleland had to be closed due to students being attacked... Goblins.
According to a local elder, the children panicked and it was impossible to continue their classes.
The story of goblins may sound like a child's fiction for a European, but in Africa this is quite a serious argument for closing the school.
Adults are also afraid of evil spirits.
In the summer, for example, a hospital was closed in zimbabwe because the medical staff were also attacked by goblins.
Fire crews were called to rescue a lost puppy that was stuck 50ft above the ground on a dangerous quarry
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after being involved in a minor accident
Three days later, she was stuck in a quarry and was spotted walking her dog
Firefighters descended on a rope on a steep slope to save the dog from imminent death
The puppy was lucky to be rescued after fire crews were called to lift him up and deliver him to safety after he was somehow stuck at 50ft on a dangerous ledge on a steep slope.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after being involved in a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at the Flaperite quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked west Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They frantically searched for their missing dog and posted messages on social media sites after it ran into the quarry following a minor accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a keen dog breeder spotted Ruby getting stuck at 50 feet on a quarry ledge.
A technical rescue team from the Klekiton Fire Station rushed to the scene, went down on ropes to rescue Ruby, and used a carry to lift her up the hill.
Specialist rescue officer Andy Clayton said: "She was in a dangerous position."
It was right in the middle of a steep slope - 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move and muscle during the rescue, she completely froze.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is incredible.
Specialist rescue officer Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky to have been rescued."
There was a chance that she could have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an examination and it was determined that she was fine, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was scary to watch the rescue."
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The vet said that if she had become exhausted and passed out, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were great.
It was very brave what they did.
We are so grateful and each of them was absolutely awesome.
Mr Alderson, from Keatley, added: "We were afraid it might fall, but she stayed there."
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she got there.
Do you think travel agents are a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be on the opposite side.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel firm now expects its underlying full-year pre-tax profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, up from a previous forecast of between $305 million and $315 million.
If the current benchmarks are met, this would be a 12 to 17 per cent increase, compared with a record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
Managing director Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made 8 per cent of its first-half profit and the start of the second half with good performance, particularly on non-business trips to Australia and the UK.
"Since the beginning of the year, we have been operating with profits across our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have record high pre-tax profits for the full year," he said.
"This includes Australia and the UK, which usually bring us the biggest profits."
In Australia, leisure business rebounded in the second half of the year, which offset a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure business was doing well, while corporate clients were spending less.
Its U.S. business has compensated for losses suffered during the seasonally weak first half of the year and is expected to make a profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20.
Estonian Defense Ministry website restored after attack by Ukrainian hackers
The work of the Estonian Ministry of Defense website has been restored after the morning cyberattack, the press service of the ministry informs.
According to the Vice-Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for Information and Administrative Affairs Taimar Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly set everything up, by now the site has been restored.
"The damage done to the ministry is minimal," Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to say who organized the attacks.
"We will certainly analyze the causes of the incident and draw our own conclusions from it, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents completely," he acknowledged.
On November 1, the Anonymous Ukraine group posted an appeal online confirming a hacking attack on the Estonian Defense Ministry's website and opposing the Ukraine-NATO partnership.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We must not be nato's servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member states.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia.
Ukraine should not be anyone's slave.
We are in favor of an independent Ukraine.
"Hands off Ukraine," Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the company of the Marine Corps of Theodosian separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Corps will take part in the command and staff exercises of the NATO Response Force Jazz Steadfast-2013.
Japan to discuss peace treaty with Russia
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to openly exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," Kishida said at the meeting.
The Japanese Foreign Minister recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and became bilateral.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that Russia will meet Japan in solving complex political issues, RIA Novosti reports.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia involves resolving the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today demanding the return of the land lost after the Second World War to the country.
Cars drive through the Japanese capital, from which the loudspeaker says: "Bring back the northern territories!".
The police do not stop the protesters, they make sure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and have a masquerade for our neighborhood.
Now I'm more like a miser.
I haven't called in the last two years to hand out candy in my apartment, and I probably won't do it this year either.
However, the statistics show that I am a white crow in terms of Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, the majority of Americans - 158 million - will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I expect every Halloween is the trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent on the suits will be spent.
This year at the peak of fashion sexy inanimate objects.
Women no longer have to be women of sexual professions; they can also be sexual foods, such as pizza, burgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we're going to see a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I'm sure Daft Punk-style astronauts will get into our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the costumes that are searched most often are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
Perhaps there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed up our dogs last year and to my surprise we weren't the only ones.
What's more, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't mince the details.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, lollipops, Milk Duds candy, Twizzlers chewing candies and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-requiring children who are prepared to conquer our neighborhoods.
What's more, we'll buy and - let's not fool ourselves - eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to eat is corn grains; and yet, according to the National Confectioners Association, almost 35 million pounds of them are sold for Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery I've yet to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween more than haunted houses.
They have stunning titles, such as "Horror Behind the Walls" (which, incidentally, is in a real prison), "Howling and Scream" and "House of Shock".
What's more, according to the America Haunts Society, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America, generating about $500 million in revenue, and those stunning photos where you almost peed, which your friend posted on Facebook, and you can't take it away, and then the guy you like sees that picture and leaves a comment like "cool facial expression."
And finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting out Jack's lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, something we've been doing since childhood.
Luckily for us, the fashion for baby pumpkins only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up carving out these pumpkins rather than sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack's lamp, slowly drying on your porch, probably came from Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkins this year.
If you want a more complicated job, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to cut something out of their pumpkin weighing 2032 pounds.
Bayern defender David Alaba became Austria's best athlete in 2013, according to the Bundesliga's official website.
In this dispute, he outperformed representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third place was taken by ski jumper Gregor Schlierenzauer.
Last season, the 21-year-old Filipino-Nigerian Austrian helped his team win the Champions League, Championship and German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
Two men commit suicide in Kineshma and the district
Earlier, one of the hanged had already attempted suicide.
On October 30, at about 1 a.m., a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging in the village of Lugovoi.
It is known that he has previously attempted suicide.
What prompted the man to take such a step is unknown.
On 31 October, at 11:50 a.m., a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, took his own life by hanging.
There were no signs of violent death, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Kineshemsky" reports.
Mick Jagger says he didn't flirt with Katy Perry when she was 18
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was the backing vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she had dinner with the veteran rocker, and noted, "He flirted with me when I was 18."
She added: "It was a long time ago and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for 70-year-old Jagger said he "categorically denies that he ever hit Katy Perry."
The spokesman added: "Perhaps she is confusing him with someone else."
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on this year's Rolling Stones tour.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
U.S.-Mexico drug-trafficking tunnel found equipped with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
U.S. authorities have described the four-by-three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret passages they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, which is almost six football fields, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with inconspicuous warehouses, making it easier to load drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled through it, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was found.
Three men who law enforcement say worked as drivers have been charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.
If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in central Mexico after a marijuana harvest in October, which challenged drug cartels to quickly deliver their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of about 700 yards, equipped with railroad tracks that went from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
Parents of Georgia teen who died in 'ridiculous accident' believe their son was killed
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a collapsed sports mat in his high school gym believe their son was killed, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertically standing mat leaning against the back of the stands in the gym of his high school.
Lawndes County Sheriff's Department investigators concluded that Johnson died of a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family disputes that.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was killed," Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff says.
"They think it's against logic, the laws of physics, and common sense," Crump said.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag and they returned him in a body bag," he said.
U.S. attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What caused the death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made the announcement at a news conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the view that there are sufficient grounds" for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that an initial autopsy showed Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxia."
However, a second autopsy, Moore said, revealed another cause of death.
"There are a few issues that need to be resolved or clarified," he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
A spokesman for the Loudouns County Sheriff's Office was not available for comment when contacted Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance footage that investigators viewed.
The teen's parents said they hope the videos contain clues as to how he died.
Pakistani authorities begin talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was announced by the embassy of this country in the UK, where Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The Prime Minister of Pakistan made a statement about negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed the issues of Pakistan-India relations, the global energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister informed that the dialogue with the Taliban has begun," the Pakistani Embassy in London said in a statement.
"He said that he hopes and prays that the dialogue will work in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan," the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently in the northwestern parts of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are pushing for an Islamic state.
Islamabad's government had previously attempted to negotiate with the local Taliban, but the movement refused dialogue.
It stated that it would negotiate only if the authorities sent troops stationed in areas where the Taliban operated and released arrested Islamists from prison.
Nawaz Sharif arrives in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
The goalkeeper of "Neftechemist" Matt Dalton refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the post of mentor of the Lower Kams.
The goalkeeper believes that the acting head coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys great authority among the players and will cope with his duties.
Recall that today "Neftechemist" dismissed Krikunov.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov," Dalton was quoted as saying by RIA Novosti.
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will cope with the obligations assigned to him - I have no doubt about that.
In the team he enjoys great authority, this young specialist definitely has a great future.
Pawnshop owners in Singapore are doing well while the middle class is struggling
At a pawn shop in Singapore's Bendemir shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga lays a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for her daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there," Ms. Amirthalinga says.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia - where household debt is growing - is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its transaction, this week became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
A jewelry loan is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in Ms. Amirthaling's case), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% - just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
That is why millions of people throughout the region are turning to pawnshops because families are under pressure from rising costs of living and the rapid growth of household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and cheap credit fueled by free monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to offset declining incomes as their economies slow.
This week, Standard and Poor's, a rating agency, pointed to an increase in family leverage, mainly due to the growth of mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt-to-gross domestic ratio in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about thailand's high level of consumer debt, which this week barely emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing decline in exports and weakening consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with prices rising, people in the middle and bottom of the income scale will be looking for ways to top up their incomes wherever they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Record high gold prices in the past two years have increased the rush with which people lay their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the things laid in 200 pawnshops of the city-state are gold products.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's lay down grandma's gold chain and get it back next month."
In Thailand, easyMoney, the largest pawnshop operator, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, a branch operator in Bendemir and 15 others similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia too, said Yah Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company will fund the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of a stock placement on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have sparked a fire of criticism over high interest rates, Ms. Jah says that the pawnshop not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase the debt directly.
"Customers are laying down items they already own, and monetizing personal assets doesn't increase household debt," she says.
The mortgage is gaining increasing public acceptance as a means of obtaining short-term, secured financing.
And at the same time pawnshops are used not only by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches, laying gold bars or Rolex watches that can yield up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties," says Ms. Yaah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Bashkiria can put grain up for auction no earlier than early 2014
Bashkiria during state procurement interventions can put grain up for auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolay Kovalenko.
Today, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
So far, the price on the market is higher, and there is demand.
"Perhaps the grain will be put up for auction after the New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that this year the crops for the 2013 harvest amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
For the 2014 harvest, 550 thousand hectares were sown (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
Increased areas for winter wheat and triticale, rye remained at the same level.
In Voronezh region detained football fan who broke a window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o'clock in the evening on October 29 at the station Mud-Voronezh transport police officers removed from the passenger train two football fans - natives of the Moscow region.
Going to the game of their favorite team, the guys on the way staged a drunken brawl on the train.
The young people were taken to the line police station on duty at the Mud station to draw up a report on the administrative offence.
There, fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The police issued administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station station began to wait for his arrival.
At half past midnight, the fans left the train station, but one of them, a 22-year-old man, suddenly returned and smashed the window of the front door in the station waiting room with his foot.
A transport police officer and a security guard of the Russian Railways rushed to the sound of the broken glass.
They managed to apprehend the intruder who tried to escape from the scene.
Employees of the South-Eastern LU of the Russian Interior Ministry are conducting a check.
The issue of initiating a criminal case is being raised, said Sergei Olkhovik, a senior representative of the information and public relations department of the Russian Interior Ministry's South-Eastern LU on transport.
Russian security forces know nothing about the group "Brother's Circle" - New Izvestia
INTERFAX.RU writes about it with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After media reports about the inclusion of the U.S. Treasury Department Leps in the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate 'Brother's Circle', we looked through all the databases, but such a group was not found," - said the source of the agency.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which supposedly operates abroad.
As "NI" wrote earlier, yesterday the U.S. Treasury Department published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group "Brother's Circle."
Russian singer Grigory Leps was also named among them.
It appears on the list as "Grisha" laid out the day before.
They coincide with the data of a popular Russian artist.
The exact name is Grigory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, five other people are mentioned there.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, an Uzbek citizen and another from the former Soviet Union, whose citizenship is not specified.
The U.S. is sure that Gregory Leps, who lives in Phuket, transported money for the bandits on their order.
This message is attached to a photo of the singer and all his data, which corresponds to reality.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The department noted that they intend to impose sanctions against Leps.
Blacklisting a person on the U.S. Treasury Department's blacklisting entails blocking his assets in the United States and banning people living in the United States from doing business with him.
Leps' assistant Maya Serikova said that there were no notifications to the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question whether it is Gregory, which everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is the media.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know if they happen in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other hand - amazing and unexpected," she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, Gregory Leps does not live in Phuket, but according to the U.S. Treasury Department, he does have a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was currently on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him during a flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Is there a black box in your car?
While American road planners are trying to find money to repair the crumbling system of highways, many begin to see the solution in a small black box neatly attached to the dashboard of your car.
These devices, which track every mile a motorist pass and pass this information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt to modernize America's outdated highway finance system by planned authorities in Washington and the state.
Usually the boring arena of highway planning has suddenly spawned intense debate and racy alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government to use small boxes to track the number of miles you drive and even possibly where you drive them - and then use that information in tax bills.
The tea party movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress can't yet agree on whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They ponder how over the next decade it is possible to move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already taken to testing these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
"This is not an issue on which we can have a choice," said Hassan Ihrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which is preparing plans to begin tracking the state's miles by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology for this is already there.
This is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government's Highway Fund, which is funded by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans are no longer buying as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars drive more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not been raised in 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even by one cent at high gasoline prices.
"The gasoline tax is simply impossible to maintain," said Lee Mannich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed 500 tracking devices on cars to test the pay system.
"It will be the best alternative in the long run," he said.
The nerds call it a pardon board.
Unsurprisingly, the idea is attracting urban liberals because taxes could change the nature of travel to reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planners in California are eyeing the system as they develop strategies to meet the targets set by the state's ambitious laws to combat global warming.
But Rep. Bill Schuster ( Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he, too, sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market supporters at Reason are also thrilled to make drivers pay for every mile.
"It's not just a tax that's going to go into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of political affairs at Reason.
People directly pay for what they get.
The move is also supported by two former U.S. transportation ministers who in 2011 called on Congress to move toward a pay-per-view.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10,000 vehicles.
But House leaders rejected the proposal because of concerns from rural legislators representing voters who often travel miles to work or the city in everyday life.
Several states and cities, however, are following this path on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is evident in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon be paying the state for miles of mileage instead of a gasoline tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
In New York it is considered.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis involving trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation departments of 17 East Coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is looking at how they can implement these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently fitted with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track their every move.
"Concerns about big brother and things like that are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't what people wanted.
As the tests were well underway, the Nevada Chapter de La Disenfranchis, warned on its website, "It will be easy to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices."
There is no need to build a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to record the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of several states that are working hard to find low-cost technology that would allow state authorities to keep records of miles of driving, but without information about location and time.
If you can do that, Khan said, society will feel more relaxed.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not assist in collecting state taxes.
It sought to enter the emerging market of the type of car insurance, in which drivers pay on the basis of mileage.
But the devices it tests attract road planners because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically downloaded using the modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't track their speed and track their location," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
There were some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are far less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with providing drivers with different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can opt out of the device altogether, opting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state travel.
Elsewhere they hope to sell the idea to the wary public by forcing the devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax-free device that will also accept payment for parking meters, provide "pay as you drive" insurance, and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be attracted to participate by the benefit that they will be offered," reads the document of urban design.
Some transport system planners, however, wonder whether all the talk of pay is just a huge distraction.
The City Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area officials say Congress could very simply overcome the bankruptcy of the Highway Construction Trust by raising gasoline taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid car drivers and other persons whose vehicles do not use much petrol to pay their fair share.
"There's no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will bring in new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the selection of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after the cardinal reached the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope - this is the prerogative of a group of 120 "cardinal electors."
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said a meeting of all current cardinals, known as the Consistory, would be held before the ceremony.
"Pope Francis decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving cardinals from around the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of Cardinal electors is likely to drop by February.
He said the pope usually calls as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of Cardinals to 120 again, as well as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
The consistory next year will make a big difference because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, according to Valero.
At the moment there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a paltry number of cardinals.
It will also be the first elected cardinal since francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking for ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything on his own.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "entirely possible" that Francis would seek advice from cardinals.
But we haven't been in this situation before - it's all for us for the first time.
Valero said the popes usually elevated cardinal bishops from major parishes, but Francis is "full of surprises - so we don't know who he'll name."
7th Interregional Exhibition "Medicine and Health" opens in Ivanov
The inter-regional exhibition "Medicine and Health - 2013" opened on the basis of the sports and entertainment complex "Olympia".
First Deputy Prime Minister of the Ivanov region Olga Hasbulatova took part in the opening of the event.
The exhibition presents the work of the regional budget health institutions of the Ivanov region, as well as commercial medical institutions in the regions of Central Russia.
The exhibition will include seminars, roundtables and presentations.
During the exhibition, the work of the mobile complex (full diagnostics), mobile fluorograph, blood transfusion station is organized.
Everyone will be able to receive free diagnostic procedures, consultations of specialists, take part in a master class on physical therapy, familiarize themselves with the range of services provided in the medical institutions of the Ivanov region.
In addition, the exhibition is the Day of the Donor.
The general concept of the exhibition "Medicine and Health - 2013" - preventive direction in medicine, promotion of healthy lifestyle.
The exhibition presents medical products and services, equipment, pharmaceuticals and medicines that improve the quality of life.
The main areas of the exhibition were: the development of cooperation with manufacturers and suppliers of medical equipment in the Ivanov region and regions of Russia; Demonstration of medical products and services, equipment, pharmaceuticals and medicines that improve quality of life; establishing business contacts between medical institutions in the Ivanovo region.
Tax for foreign property owners will cause London bubble to burst
The Treasury has made a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 Budget introduced a government rate of 7% for homes worth more than £2 million and annual payments to buyers who choose to own homes in a partnership rather than as individuals.
At the moment, the state tax on residential properties in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea areas, which amounted to 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 financial year, already exceeds the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: "After increasing the state duty on high-priced homes and introducing related anti-evasion legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is undervalued regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system."
"But this move could lead to some foreign investors being reluctant to buy property in London or its current owners will not want to sell it," he added.
The value of first-class properties - the top 5 to 10 per cent of the price of housing - in London's affluent south-west belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8 per cent over the past year.
According to research firm Savills, prices in central London continued to show steady growth of 5.6 per cent year-on-year, but were overshadowed by an active "domestic market" with a surge in prices in the south-west and north (7.4 per cent). East (6.5 per cent) City.
The next meeting of the Association of Mechanical Engineers of the Tyumen region was held on the basis of the Yalutorov Automotive Plant.
As part of the event, a new line for the production of electric steel pipes was presented.
According to Denis Gribanov, the company's commercial director, a marketing study on the market for steel structures in the Tyumen region was conducted in 2011 with the new owner.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of welding pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment on it for their production.
More than 7,000 tons of manufactured products have already been shipped this year.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles," said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new mill was launched, which allows to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small profile of pipes, which is used for the tep-personal economy, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50,000 tons of products per year, which will be about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to a different type of activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in the plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase of more than 50 employees.
The company is retraining personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new unit of longitudinal cutting of steel up to five millimeters thick, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another mill, with a pipe production rate of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of pipes, which are used in housing and utilities.
The company's management aims to close up to 70 percent of the tyumen region's demand for these products.
Leonid Ostroumov, deputy director of the investment policy department, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of engineering enterprises, referring to the heads of production.
This includes forms of state support for the industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
This year, 150 million rubles are earmarked for this purpose, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider subsidy contracts, accepts documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the next year, the budget provides funds of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million - for energy-saving programs.
The funds for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the southern Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex, are reduced to 72 million rubles.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future this form of support will cease, as the motive for its introduction was compensation for the mining tax, which oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies become direct spending obligations in the region.
With this in mind, the regional government considers direct support for industrial enterprises to be a priority, not financing through them the oil industry.
Budget assistance will be related to investment projects, which will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the current situation with oil workers.
The subsidy for the equipment they buy is a competitive advantage of the industry in the southern Tyumen region, and when it is abolished it will be difficult to compete on the price with the middle band of Russia, where the labor is cheaper.
In addition, the issue of the succession of the new owner of TNK-BP - Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders at the Tyumen enterprises, is unclear.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and no application for its extension has been received.
Currently, enterprises in the south of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
The question remains whether taxes from the oil produced in the Uvat region will be paid to the region's budget or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
The second congress of the peoples of the Southern Urals was held in Chelyabinsk.
The forum is timed to coincide with the Day of People's Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
Delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive authorities - a total of about 350 people - took part in the congress.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening inter-ethnic harmony.
Here we can set an example not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no disagreements or disagreements.
We live in full understanding," said Theophanes, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Goldoustovsky.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including patriotism and cultural cooperation.
As a result of the congress, the resolution was adopted.
The unofficial part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
An exhibition of national and cultural associations of Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Syria destroys its chemical weapons production, says monitoring group
Syria has destroyed basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and munitions with poison gas, an international monitoring group said on Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites believed to contain toxic substances.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the country's civil war began nearly three years ago.
The statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
the 1 November deadline set by this Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or "inoperable" all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms to mix chemicals with the receipt of poison gas and fill in munitions.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came during fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons facility as well as storage sites, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
An activist group that tracked casualties through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of this number, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government's side, the group said, 29,954 are members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among the dead, according to the statement, were 2,202 army defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
The UN estimates of 25 July that 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been battling rebels in Safir for weeks, many of them linked to al-qaeda groups.
The center said Thursday there were casualties on both sides, but gave no specifics.
The fighting underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal, at the height of the ongoing civil war.
In a statement, the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team was "now satisfied that it has verified and seen all critical production facilities and mixing/refueling equipment destroyed by Syria."
She added that "no additional inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites claimed by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the two sites for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said both sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and ... the items of the chemical weapons programme in them have been moved to other declared locations that have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the Safir site was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I applaud the courage and bravery that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most difficult mission this organization has ever undertaken," said Ahmet Uzyumju, Director General of the Observatory Group, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has pitted rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, against Assad's government and its security forces, which are made up of members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
As for other events, the head of the center Rami Abdurrahman said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Report: Obama campaign considers excluding Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest advisers were secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 election list.
This discovery is the brightest sensation of all the expected books by Mark Halperin and John Hailemann about the 2012 campaign "Betting Doubled: The Game Changed 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's closest aides conducted "large-scale research in focus groups and opinion polls in late 2011" to assess whether Biden's exclusion could help raise fading hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to The Times political commentator Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the efforts of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daly, to assess the impact on the vote of former Secretary clinton's appointment as vice president.
The possible replacement was a secret carefully guarded in the Chicago campaign headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers - including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew a replacement was under consideration.
The book " Doubles Stakes" claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden despite their "close personal relationship," but ultimately abandoned the move when their data showed that adding Clinton to the polls would not "significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I was very vocal in my support for a lot of things, and that was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
You have to remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh my God, what are we going to do?"
While Daley described the study as a "necessary test," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the campaign had invested heavily in examining whether the move would pay dividends on the vote.
"Election headquarters don't spend that amount of money on polls and focus groups unless they take something seriously," Martin said on the AK 360 program.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about a possible reshuffle.
While Daley said he didn't think the president "was aware" of a possible replacement, the former chief of staff acknowledged that it was "possible" Obama knew.
Martin added that the "double stakes" did not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political probe had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed obama was unaware of the study of the possibility of removing Biden from the polls.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
The head of the RFU control and disciplinary committee Artur Grigoryants said that "Kuban" was fined 500,000 rubles, reports "SE" correspondent Filipp Papenkov from the House of Football.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for the burning of the flag of Dagestan by fans on the podium during the home match of the 14th round against Anzhi.
At the meeting there were representatives of both clubs, a man from the RFPL.
We have examined all available materials.
For the illegal behavior of spectators "Kuban" was fined 500,000 rubles.
Legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to their estimates, the consumption of beer in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is at best.
Although businessmen initially expected to grow.
After all, this year is not bad for them: sales fell by 7 percent.
The head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, The Chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps, told about all this at the third annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Commodities of Everyday Demand in Russia", which has just ended in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already decreased by 18 percent, as in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in regulation of the brewing industry in terms of the production and turnover of beer - a drink with a low alcohol content - told the audience Sheps.
No country in the world has such a strict restriction of the beer market, unpredictable introduction of more and more illogical bans, which are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
Brewer lamented that many legislative prohibitions designed to reduce alcohol abuse have little impact, but new initiatives are constantly emerging.
The ban on selling alcohol in kiosks was the hardest hit by beer producers.
"We immediately lost 35,000 consumers," Said Isaac Shepps.
Brewers have two forecasts for next year.
Optimistic - the one that Sheps said: sales of foam drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 percent.
To keep their profits, businessmen are forced to move away from varieties designed for the mass consumer, in the class of "premium": beer will be less, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"According to my observations, the level of alcoholism remains at about the same level," said alexey Sotnikov, a narcologist.
However, the proportion of patients who drink strong drinks surrogates, as well as those who are "hooked" on alcohol-containing tonic drinks like "Jaguar" has increased, whereas ten years ago it was the "beer" alcoholism that prevailed.
What will the construction of TPU in Moscow lead to?
Every year the capital authorities promise to equip more and more transport hubs (TPUs).
By 2020, it is planned to put into operation 255 TPUs.
Our correspondent was looking into what the project is actually turning out to be.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence was built near the Smolensk metro line.
The inscription read that the transport hub is being equipped.
All this was very strange, because next to "Smolensk" no ground transport stops and, therefore, it is impossible to cross it.
To get to the nearest trolley bus stop on the Garden Ring, you need to overcome about 130 meters, including the land crossing through The Karmanitsky Lane.
Now "Smolensk" is almost all finished.
The flower stall disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt before the entrance was replaced by paving stones.
That's the whole transport hub.
Transport hubs are flat and capital, - explain in the press service of the metropolitan Department of Transport.
There are no capital TPUs yet.
And flats involve the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of commercial facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.
Actually, the flat TPU is not even engaged in transport workers, and professional well-builders from the department of capital repair of the city of Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex design, explains Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy at the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes it is enough to have a roof over your head and a scoreboard that alerts you to the time of arrival of transport.
Here, for example, at the subway "Yasenevo" recently opened a fully-fledged flat hub.
Let without sheds, but with intercepting parking lots and scoreboards indicating when the bus will come.
But in pursuit of the number of officials write in the TPU all that no matter getting.
Back in 2011, the mayor's office planned to build all 151 knots, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now there are 255 TPUs in the plans until 2020.
One and a half hundred of them promise to pass this year.
Although the city has a TPU development program, no qualitative criteria are specified, says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport."
Report on the number of objects, but the quality of transplantation on each of them often deteriorates.
According to the expert, there should be two criteria: first - reducing the time of transplantation, and secondly - convenience.
First of all, the opportunity to change the mode of transport without going under the rain.
In Moscow, the TPU sometimes goes exactly the opposite.
A striking example of the VDNH metro.
Previously, commuter buses from the Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the VVC.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavl on the street of Cosmonauts.
Further from the subway, much further from the monorail, but closer to residential buildings.
The gift that the residents did not want the bus station under the windows and complained to all possible authorities.
With capital TPU in Moscow somehow did not immediately set.
The first of them began to build about five years ago near the metro "Planernaya."
The project was intended to be exemplary.
And indeed, there was a sample of how the transfer hub, given to buy out investors, turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there are aprons for buses, a canopy not to walk from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.
However, Khimki trolleybuses No.202 and No.203 in Moscow TPU were not given a place fundamentally.
They were pushed away from the subway as strangers.
But there are more places left for trade.
There are 32 shops alone, and in general there are almost everything - from pets to car dealerships.
Well, really, what if any of the bus passengers need to buy a new car on the road?
We, when they build a capital TPU, for some reason always get a shopping center.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion, when part of the parking lot decided to give under the market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planernaya" among the parking spaces marked on the floor is brisk trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards, look angrily at our photographer.
The transplant node finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that earlier the metro "Planernaya" had a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, the merchants were pitied and allowed to intercept the parking of the transfer hub.
Still, because of the high prices there is always empty.
The funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build in its place... new flat TPU.
That's the casting.
At the Kaluga metro, the distance of the approach from the metro lobby to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, supposedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you need to go through the entire mall.
After 10 p.m., when it's closed, you have to go around it in the open.
However, the designs on "Planernaya" and "Kaluzhsky" will soon appear as flowers.
In mid-September, the city planning and land commission of the mayor's office approved planning solutions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25-storey, not counting two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow near the Tushino metro, it will have 418.7 thousand square meters of space.
Representatives of the directorate of railway stations of the Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of the TPU near the metro, have already told journalists: in future high-rise buildings will be located shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials assure that multi-level parking will occupy from a third to half of the area.
Take for example "people's" garages.
For example, the 258-seat garage, which was recently built on International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters.
So, for parking for 2.6 thousand cars "Petrovsko-Razumovskaya" will need about 80,000 "squares."
That's less than a third of the henanigans they're going to build there.
Let one or two floors go to all sorts of platforms for buses.
At least 150,000 square meters of commercial real estate remain.
And this, for a moment, almost two GUMS.
If the capital TPUs near stations and stations are built by railway workers, the rest of the sites will be mastered by the metro.
They also promised that there would be many "functional facilities," including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, the property department of the city of Moscow recently told journalists that they are developing a draft resolution according to which investors will be able to apply for a plot for TPU to officials directly.
No contests.
Therefore, they say that transport issues are a priority for the city.
The ideal TPU is, for example, Harvard Station in Boston or Spadina in Toronto, - Alexander Morozov is sure.
There trolleybuses and trams go down the ground to the metro level and the distance of approach from the subway car to the tram is only 50 meters without going outside.
There is no unnecessary trade around.
But Moscow officials are thrown to extremes.
Either we will not build anything, or we will knock off 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Oil fell in price to $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, as worries about the formation of large reserves overshadowed a report showing that China's energy-intensive manufacturing sector is gaining momentum.
Benchmark U.S. crude fell 14 cents in December delivery to $96.24 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell by 39 cents, which amounted to a 5.8 percent drop in the price for October.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. inventories have increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, inventories were replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, judging by two reports of Chinese industry showing a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China's economic recovery may continue to gain momentum after third-quarter growth rose to 7.8 percent after a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, the benchmark international oil producer also used by U.S. refiners, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, the police are searching for the perpetrator who brutally killed two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported to "New Region" in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Interior Ministry in Sverdlovsk region, the day before in the Kirov district of the Ural capital after extinguishing a fire in a three-room apartment located in an apartment building on Uralskaya Street, found the bodies of two women with signs of violent death.
The identities of the victims were soon established.
It turned out that they were sisters, one of them - a resident of Yekaterinburg 44 years, the second - a 33-year-old resident of Orenburg region.
They rented a burnt-out apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under the personal control of the chief police officer of the region Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs authorities are working out various versions of the murder, checking the alibis of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
It is also established for what purpose the women rented an apartment and where they lived before, what they were doing, with whom they maintained relations.

Vanguard coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about his team's preparations for the KHL regular championship match against Salavat, noted that the Omichi conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat against Metalurh.
The specialist stressed that Vanguard needs to pay more attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against Metalurh," the official Vanguard website quotes Chebaturkin as saying.
- We conceded a lot of pucks, not a very pleasant moment.
Missed because of their mistakes, because of the failure to perform the game task.
We knew that the opponent had performers.
Statistically, they had five attacks in a hurry - three pucks we scored.
Very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account in preparation for today's game?
We carefully analyze each match with the guys, talk after the game, prepare for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is executed.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metalurh.
The game was performed, and the score was 2-0.
We conceded a goal "in the dressing room" - and in the third period began to make mistakes.
Given how hard the game was, I didn't see the point in connecting the defenders.
You have to defend as a team.
Now Vanguard has a long home series, matches go through the day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now - the realization of their moments and the performance of the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you perform the installation - everything is not so difficult.
Bombardier's profit falls as shipments fall and plane orders fall
Bombardier Corp., the Canadian manufacturer of planes and trains, reported on Thursday a 15 percent decline in net profit due to a decline in third-quarter orders and deliveries and contract problems at its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its newest CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide new information on whether ambitious plans to commercialize the aircraft would be implemented by next September.
After the first flight of the prototype aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it flew only three more times, raising questions about whether the test stage is on schedule.
The results fell short of forecasts and led to a drop of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, downgraded his valuation on Thursday from "above the market average" to "mid-market" because of the belief that share growth is limited in the next quarter or two.
"While the decline in aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the transport department's profit figures," Doerksen said in a stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to gain a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, there are not too many solid orders for the CSeries, as potential buyers wait for the results of flight tests to test the company's claims about fuel efficiency and the potential cost-effectiveness of the new liner.
In total, there are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief executive Pierre Baudouin was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 solid orders by the time the first aircraft was put into commercial operation.
On Thursday, executives also assured analysts and the media that the program was moving forward as planned.
"The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Baudouan said during a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned for the plane's downtime.
All manufacturers plan the tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for upgrades, so we did.
This will happen throughout the flight testing program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks and all others will soon follow, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier said it was assessing the timing of the commissioning and would provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although likely in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that commissioning will be rescheduled for the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same at 9 cents.
Gross revenue fell slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and gross revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft maker said it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, down from 57 the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The aerospace department's order portfolio was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace field, the results were in line with our objectives, but the low number of incoming orders and overall market conditions were an unpleasant factor," Baudouan said.
Gross revenue for aerospace fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train maker, said gross revenue in the sector rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport division was $32.6 billion as of September 30, which is slightly higher than the figure from December 31.
The revenues of the transport division were negatively affected by problems with the performance of several large contracts.
Management said a new development plan would be unveiled in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will join the board, fell 8.5 percent to C$4.83 in mid-Thursday trading.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly revenue on Thursday.
The chairman of the Krasnoyarsk court was robbed of his ID, hitting him on the head
Unidentified assailants attacked the chairman of the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court, Vladimir Twokonko, stealing his ID.
According to Interfax, late on Wednesday night the attackers hit the judge on the head, causing him to lose consciousness.
When the 63-year-old president of the court came to his senses, he found that his official ID had been pulled out.
The criminals did not take money and other valuables.
He made his own way home, and contacted the police only the next day.
Crime investigation and search for criminals are underway.
According to a senior official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria
A senior administration official confirmed in an interview with Fox News that Israeli warplanes struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian-made SA-125 missile.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out airstrikes against missiles inside Syria.
Thorium - the new hope of nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Nuclear power does without both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste disposal.
Recently, scientists have noticed thorium - another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and, according to experts, its cleavage does not leave waste that should be stored for centuries.
New machines will appear in the Moscow metro.
But they will sell tickets to passengers not for money, but for squats.
One trip costing 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger 30 squats.
The number of squats will count the special device using modern technologies, ITAR-TASS reports, citing the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first vehicle will be installed at the Exhibition Station on November 8, 2013.
In the presentation of the new ticket sports will be the president of the Olympic Committee of Russia, Alexander Shchukov, and Olympic champions gymnasts Alexei Nemov and Elena zamolodchikova.

Two YMCA officers have been charged with sexual offences before being charged against Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission has revealed
Two YMCA NSW officers were charged with child sex offences before charges were brought in 2011 against Child care worker Jonathan Lord in Caringbach, the Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse has said.
But the commission's opening statement said it had "never dealt with cases of child sexual abuse within her organization."
Chief executive Philip Hare was asked about one case in which an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another case in which a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children under his care in 1991.
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, the counsel assisting the commission, that he was aware of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA also made inaccuracies in its opening speech to the commission, claiming that "there were external checks by the YMCA that recognised that the YMCA was at the forefront of child safety."
Evidence submitted to the commission indicates that the YMCA has been notified that it has received the second of four possible quality audits from the End of the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that he and the lower management had made a mistake in hiring lord and had failed to ensure staff had a clear understanding of their obligations to report child safety breaches.
Earlier this year Lorde was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was jailed for a minimum of six years.
But Mr Hare rejected the suggestion that the YMCA's corporate ethics had prevented staff from reporting lord's child safety breaches.
Officers testified that they had witnessed abuses, including the fact that Lorde was alone with the children, personally cared for them, put them on their knees, said he loved one of them and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Oakwell, who was under the Lord's leadership and asked for her to be trained in child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that she found Jackie Barnat, child care manager at the YMCA's Caringbah branch, who was lord's leader, "very intimidating and often difficult to access."
The Executive Director said he did not accept staff's explanation that they were embarrassed to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with Lorde led them away from the idea of having to report him.
Mr Hare said he had presented to the YMCA board of New South Wales his view that the lesson for the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was not "concerned with providing information" from staff and the council agreed with him.
Mr Hare said the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations emerged was made by YMCA director-general of child custody Liam Wheatley.
He said it was intended to prevent the damage to evidence, but was "overzealous" and the decision was poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a child-friendly organisation during Jonathan Lord's tenure between 2009 and 2011, child molestation expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and monitoring staff.
The hearing has been adjourned until December 20.
Guillaume Nicklu's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts exceptional staging and historical detail, but it is also harder to perceive than it should have been.
The film, set in France in the 1760s, tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a monastery by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadist abbot and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never descends to vulgarity or sensation - and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the narrative risks becoming a test of the kind of snubin and audience.
U.S. special services eavesdrop on Pope's personal phone
The Activities of the Vatican are under the watchful control of american intelligence services.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that US intelligence wiretapped all of the previous Pope Benedict's negotiations, and now tightly patronizes Pope Francis.
His phone started tapping before he became head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new pope was also under surveillance.
What was given special importance in the United States.
The special service connected to the cell phones of cardinals who gathered in Rome to choose the next Pope.
The phones of the residence where the conclave members lived were also tapped.
American spies bugged all the main contenders for the papal throne to prevent the appearance of a figure undesirable for Washington.
Panorama magazine writes that the "big ear of the United States" continued to intercept the conversations of prelates until the completion of the conclave on March 12.
It is alleged that the Argentine Archbishop of Bergolio has been singled out in the United States since 2005 as the future pope.
U.S. intelligence has also been in talks over the election of a new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that the Roman Embassy of the United States continues to work a secret group of operatives of the CIA and NSA, extracting information about politicians and financial flows.
For his part, the Vatican conciliatoryly announced that it does not care about the American, even if it happens.
The U.S. leadership has no secrets from the holy fathers.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It is safe to say that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, entertainer Frank Fay, who worked as an entertainer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a colloquial manner.
Fay's innovation was eventually picked up by others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then achieved more success, reached a level where they were too famous to play for the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as "Stand for Heroes, an annual musical and comedy benefit concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, which will feature bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has expanded.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival have gained popularity in an unconventional way, for example through shows on small TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll gained notoriety for his role in a comedy series on a little-known cable channel (deliberately scrubbing FXX's "League" on fantasy football), and now hosts his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the cast on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation Areas," though she's best known for the viral series "Marseille - Shell in Boots."
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with original style (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, sly, racially focused by Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful director on television and in film, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely a central element of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walks down a street between two houses and thinks, "If I'm left without money at all, maybe I'll live here."
