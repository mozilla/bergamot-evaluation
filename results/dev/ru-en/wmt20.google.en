Rubin&#39;s midfielder Pavel Mogilevets spoke about the reasons for the team&#39;s unsuccessful play.
Kazan in the Russian championship suffered four defeats in a row, and also flew out of the Cup.
We tune in to each game, - Izvestia Mogilevets is quoted as saying.
Therefore, each of us needs to think about the reasons for such unsuccessful matches.
There are still meetings ahead - we need to prepare for them and correct the situation.
How?
If we knew, we probably would have already fixed it.
But first of all, it seems to me, we need to add in such a component as martial arts.
In my opinion, we have problems with this.
The Kremlin supports the ban on smoking on the balconies of residential buildings
The Kremlin supports any measures that will save lives, said presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov, commenting on the ban on smoking on the balconies and loggias of apartments.
Earlier, the Cabinet approved amendments to the Fire Fighting Regulations, according to which it is forbidden to use open fire on balconies and rooms of residential buildings.
Later, the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia reported that it was, among other things, a ban on smoking on the balconies and loggias of apartments and hotels.
The changes will take effect on October 1, 2019.
For violation, administrative liability is provided.
The Kremlin has a positive attitude towards any decisions that help save human lives.
“We know how many fires there are, many of them have very tragic consequences and public outcry.
Therefore, any saved life justifies such decisions, &quot;Peskov said.
First of all, the spokesman assesses this as a fire-fighting measure, and not a way to protect neighbors from tobacco smoke.
Peskov also noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not welcome smoking and is a supporter of a healthy lifestyle.

China strongly opposes US adoption of &quot;Taipei Bill&quot;
China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called &quot;Taipei Bill,&quot; which seriously violates the One China Principle and the Three Sino-US Joint Communiqués.
This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council of the People&#39;s Republic of China for Taiwan Affairs Ma Xiaoguang.
The approval by the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee of this bill is also a serious violation of international law and basic principles of international relations and gross interference in the internal affairs of China, said Ma Xiaoguang.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China, and related issues are related to the internal affairs of China.
&quot;We call on the American side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue in order to avoid further damage to Sino-American relations, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,&quot; he said.
China must and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone or any force, stressed Ma Xiaoguang.
TikTok hides objectionable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18
Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok is censoring videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet&#39;s independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong, The Guardian says.
In the documents that turned out to be the publication, it is said that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) is using the application to promote the goals of China&#39;s foreign policy abroad.
The bulk of violations related to China&#39;s policy fall under &quot;incitement to hatred.&quot;
In each case, TikTok places objectionable posts in a context that fits the general rules so that the actions of the social network do not look like censorship.
For example, the prohibition against criticizing China&#39;s socialist system falls under the general prohibition of &quot;criticizing or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.&quot;
The ban on mentioning the Tiananmen Square incidents or the Cambodian genocide falls under &quot;distorting the history of China or other countries.&quot;
The document also lists the banned names of twenty &quot;foreign leaders or statesmen&quot;, including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the document says.
Prohibited material falls into two categories, the document says.
Posts from the first category are deleted by social network administrators and may result in user blocking.
Not too severe violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: &quot;We are currently using a localized approach for moderation, and we also involve independent local experts.&quot;
Russian TikTok users do not have specific restrictions on publications, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Producer Center.
The Producer Center is one Russian media company that officially works with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers &quot;Producer Center&quot; are coordinated with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be posted without approval, reports Bogdanov.
When asked whether it is possible to speak out about politics or Putin on TikTok, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says that he has seen such publications.
Roman Zaripov, founder of Our Didgital agency, agrees with Bogdanov: &quot;The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you cannot post shocking content, discriminatory statements, and so on.&quot;
But under these rules, you can bring any content that the moderators do not like, Zaripov notes.
Zaripov&#39;s agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
According to the user agreement, only people over the age of 13 can use TikTok.
Social network administrators check their age using artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, says Bogdanov.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the WeWork coworking space.

Strong earthquake sparks panic in Turkey&#39;s largest city
Last Thursday, September 26, an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.9 in Istanbul occurred in Istanbul.
34 people were injured, ten of them are still in hospitals.
Istanbul resident Melike admitted that she had a panic attack for the first time in her life.
&quot;I cried so much.
Sobbed right at the workplace.
Later it became easier, I returned to business.
But I am so ashamed now! &quot;, - the girl told the TV channel&quot; 360 &quot;.
&quot;There was a really strong earthquake in Istanbul
Can&#39;t go back so far!
But on the whole I&#39;m fine, &quot;political scientist Ceylan Ozgul shared his impressions.
Project manager Celine noted that the mayor of the city keeps all residents informed, but, according to her, the townspeople still feel small tremors of a magnitude of about 3.2 or 3.5.
She also drew attention to the communication problem immediately after the earthquake.
The woman said that she could not get through to her mother, but the Internet worked &quot;perfectly&quot; and she was able to send a message via WhatsApp.

Roszdravnadzor reported on the results of the check on the amputation of a child&#39;s hand
A child&#39;s hand was amputated in the Rostov region due to a mistake by doctors, Vzglyad reports with reference to the website of the territorial body of Roszdravnadzor.
An 11-year-old boy broke his arm, after which a plaster cast was applied to him at the Zernograd district hospital.
After some time, the child developed gangrene and was amputated.
As a result of the check, it turned out that there were violations of the timeliness and correctness of the diagnosis, as well as the standard and volume of assistance provided.
The inspection materials were transferred to the Investigative Directorate of the Investigative Committee of Russia for the region.
Earlier, URA.RU reported that the head physician of the Yuzhnouralsk city hospital was arrested.
Russians warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, there has been an increase in the number of calls from fraudsters who replace the bank&#39;s phone number.
This is reported by &quot;Kommersant&quot; with reference to the data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator transmitted information to telecom operators about more than 2.5 thousand numbers from which they called clients of various financial organizations.
In 189 cases, operators discovered a number substitution.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases they imposed restrictions on the use of financial services.
The deputy head of the information security department of the Central Bank, Artem Sychev, said that a wide range of Russian banks had encountered the number substitution.
He explained that operators do not always respond to the Central Bank&#39;s warnings about fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such an obligation in the Law on Communications.
Otkritie Bank, Rosbank and Alfa-Bank confirmed information about an increase in the number of fraudulent calls with number spoofing.
According to the press service of Beeline, some of the information about fraudulent calls transmitted by the Central Bank was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with clients.
Blocking them would lead to disruptions in the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudsters&#39; numbers, which the telecom operator will contact with each call to check the number.
He explained that in order to create such a base, it would be necessary to amend the legislation.

Stoltenberg discussed with Zelensky Ukraine&#39;s accession to NATO
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed Ukraine&#39;s membership in the alliance on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The Secretary General spoke about this during a speech at Columbia University in New York.
Answering the question whether the relevant topic was raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they really discussed this issue, and also emphasized that in his answer he did not name the timing of Ukraine&#39;s entry into NATO.
According to him, any country that would like to join the North Atlantic Alliance is obliged to fulfill certain conditions in order to meet specific standards, writes RT.
In Crimea, Zelensky was offered an alternative to the NATO course
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, instead of pursuing a course towards joining NATO, should start building good-neighborly relations with Russia.
This was announced on Friday, September 27, by the co-chairman of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Chegrinets.
&quot;Pan President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but he should heed the advice of [US President] Donald Trump, which he listened to with a sour face, and improve relations with the Russian president,&quot; Chegrinets told RIA Novosti.
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian president will be able to stay in power only if relations with the Russian Federation are improved.
Earlier on September 27, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that he had a conversation with Zelensky on the topic of the country&#39;s entry into the alliance.
According to him, for this, Ukraine is obliged to fulfill certain conditions.
On June 5, Rada deputy Yevhen Balitsky said that Ukraine&#39;s possible entry into the alliance does not guarantee an improvement in life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
Barcelona blackmails Neymar
Spanish Barcelona and former Brazilian footballer Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the striker moved to France&#39;s Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost went to court, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Themis.
Otherwise, they refuse to return him.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, started an interesting trick: according to the agreement with Barça, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the striker ended up at PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Moreover, the Brazilian&#39;s lawyers insist that the club also owes him interest for late payments.
When in the capital of Catalonia it became known about the claims of Neymar, “Barcelona” sent a counterclaim.
&quot;Blue Garnet&quot; insist that the bonus was due for the fulfillment of the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was entitled to only a quarter of 40 million euros and requires a return of a proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and “Barça” almost agreed on the return of the “prodigal” player in the bosom of Catalonia.
True, the deal fell through, but there is still hope for the forward transition.
And now, as Sports.Ru reports with reference to insiders, the club&#39;s lawyers told the player&#39;s representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not settled out of court, this will exclude the possibility of the Brazilian&#39;s return.
Neymar himself wants to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans would buy him back.

But Laar replied that the goal of the Reform Party was to get two seats on the board of the Bank of Estonia - so that in addition to Jaanus Tamkivi, Andres Sutt would also be on the board.

A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a cart found in a garbage heap
A resident of the American city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested on attempted murder charges after he swung a samurai sword at his opponent in a dispute over a cart found in the trash.
Curtis Miller, 54, was digging through a pile of rubbish near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers, who went out for an evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the garbage.
Miller saw Beavers&#39; find and was upset.
He believed that he could qualify for the cart, since he was the first to start digging through the trash.
The men began to argue.
Suddenly Beavers grabbed a cart and ran with it towards his house.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he found in the same heap and began to pursue his opponent.
He caught up with Beavers near his house.
Miller drew his sword from its scabbard and began swinging it in the direction of the kidnapper of the cart.
Beevers informed Miller that the incident was being recorded on video.
Noticing the video camera, Miller fled, but threatened to return.
Beevers left the cart in the yard and went into the house.
Soon after, he saw an unknown woman enter his yard and take the cart, shouting insults.
The police were already looking for Miller for driving without a license.
The man was detained and charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked and wounded a stranger with a sword.
Thus, he reacted to the fact that the guests at the wedding, which was celebrated in the same hotel where he was staying, did not give him a light.
Riots for three
The &quot;Moscow case&quot; against participants in summer protest actions, the further, the more noticeably it breaks up into separate fragments and loses its political content.
Evidence for the very fact of &quot;riots&quot; does not stand up to scrutiny, but in the absence of a political decision to put the brakes on the case, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the withdrawal of the charges.
The collapse of the case should inspire society, but will certainly leave the security officials in extreme irritation, whose efforts to fill the case with persons involved and evidence were in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants under Art. 212 of the Criminal Code (riots) - Aleksey Minyailo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligations, and a few hours later he was completely rehabilitated: the TFR dropped the charges against him.
Minyailo spent almost two months under arrest, several professional communities stood up for him at once: historians, priests, writers.
After that, only two accused of participation in the riots remained in the case (there were 13 initially accused): Sergei Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on September 3, and Samariddin Radjabov, whom the court extended his arrest until the end of December the day before (he is also accused of using violence in against a representative of the authorities, Article 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court passed a verdict on the author of the comic petition on Latvia&#39;s accession to the United States
The Riga Vidzeme suburb court sentenced Denis Bartetsky, the author of the joke petition for Latvia&#39;s joining the United States of America.
It is noted that the man was assigned 80 hours of correctional labor and one year of probation.
&quot;Common sense is not the strongest side of our system,&quot; Bartetsky commented on the court&#39;s decision.
He also added that usually the punishment is less than requested.
The collection of signatures on Latvia&#39;s accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, simultaneously with this petition, the site was collecting signatures on the accession of Latvia to the &quot;Galactic Empire&quot; and on the country&#39;s withdrawal from the solar system and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case was initiated against Bartetsky under the first paragraph of Article 82 of the country&#39;s Criminal Law - &quot;Public call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia.&quot;
Prior to that, in 2016, the author of an Internet petition on Latvia&#39;s annexation to Russia received six months in prison.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to punish for insulting police officers on the Internet
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia has prepared amendments to the law &quot;On the Police&quot; in order to protect law enforcement officers from the dissemination of libelous and defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, an application for public discussion of the draft law appeared on the federal portal of normative legal acts, the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honor and dignity of a police officer from &quot;dissemination in information and communication networks, including on the Internet, defamatory information, including defamatory information.&quot;
Exactly how the police are supposed to be protected from libel online is not specified.
At the same time, the explanation to the document notes that the provisions of the amendments will be applied &quot;by individualizing the mechanism&quot; already provided for by the law on blocking posts that offend government officials and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws came into force in March this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public discussions and an independent anti-corruption review.
According to the explanatory note, the amendments to the law &quot;On Police&quot; should come into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law punishing &quot;blatant disrespect for the state&quot; on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource about the violation and gives it a day to eliminate it.
For the first violation of the prohibitions, a fine is provided in the amount of 30 to 300 thousand rubles, and for a repeated violation - an administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslavl publication 76.ru.
Shortly thereafter, the Chudovsky District Court of the Novgorod Region fined a local resident 30 thousand rubles for posting on the network &quot;two records with information in an indecent form that offends human dignity and public morality and expresses clear disrespect for society, the state, authorities, exercising state power in the RF &quot;.
Deadline for cutting mortgage rates announced
Home loan rates in Russia will decrease until the end of 2019.
This was stated by the general director of the credit organization &quot;Dom.rf&quot; Alexander Plutnik, reports &quot;Interfax&quot;.
As Plutnik noted at a collegium under the Russian Ministry of Construction, most banks in the remaining months of the year will carry out another cycle of mortgage rates reduction, and the market average will reach 8.9 percent - the level envisaged by the Housing and Urban Environment national project.
According to the project passport, in 2019 the average mortgage rate should be 8.9 percent, in 2021 - 8.5 percent, by 2024 - 7.9 percent.
The program provides for &quot;providing affordable housing to families with average incomes, including the creation of opportunities for purchase (their construction of housing using a mortgage loan, the rate of which should be less than 8 percent).&quot;
Earlier in September, it became known that one of the largest players in the Russian mortgage market, Sberbank, plans to carry out another reduction in rates on housing loans by the end of 2019.
Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly understood.
The most famous is pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are well researched and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain age-related diseases (among them cardiovascular, some types of cancer).
Known sources of phytoestrogens are all legumes (the most popular is soybeans), hops, and flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such dietary supplements cannot be a full-fledged substitute for natural hormones.
The possible harm from such additives cannot be ruled out.
For example, against the background of their intake, the production of their own hormones may decrease due to the fact that too many analogs from the outside enter the body.
Veretennikov urged to revive the Kazakhstani &quot;Zhenis&quot;.
Former forward of Rotor and the Russian national team Oleg Veretennikov joined the action to revive the Kazakhstani Zhenis.
The club from Astana, which in different years was called &quot;Dynamo&quot;, &quot;Tselinnik&quot;, &quot;Astana&quot; and &quot;Zhenis&quot;, was disbanded in 2014.
Veretennikov defended his colors in 2004 and 2008.
“I learned about the action to revive the football club“ Zhenis ”, organized by its fans.
And I could not stay away!
I spent a season and a half in this club.
These were not the best times in terms of results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its loyal fans who have always been with the team!
The Munaitpasov stadium, where I scored my 200th goal in my career, will forever remain in my memory!
&quot;Zhenis&quot; must be reborn!
He has a huge history and great fans.
I wish them all the best and I believe that the city authorities will return their home club to them! &quot;- wrote Veretennikov on Instagram.
The Bastion complex launched the Onyx rocket in Chukotka
For the first time, the Ministry of Defense launched a cruise missile from the Bastion complex in Chukotka.
Onyx was launched at a distance of 350 kilometers from the target, and 200 of them flew over land, which is a record for this type of missile.
The firing safety was ensured by about 10 warships and vessels of the Pacific Fleet, as well as naval aircraft, according to the Department of Information and Mass Communications of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.
Previously, the Bastion complexes were never used in Chukotka.
The hydrometeorological center named the true folk omens
In Russia, there are many popular signs by which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometeorological Center checked all the signs that supposedly work.
Meteorologists came to the conclusion that only two of them can be really trusted, albeit in a short time period.
As the scientific director of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia, Roman Vilfand, said, if the sun is red during sunset, then the next day will really be fine, as our ancestors noticed.
And if the heavenly body is whitish, then the next day it will rain.
The second working omen is based on bird watching.
They often talk about swallows, if they fly low, then this is usually due to rain.
The explanation is simple - when the air humidity is high, the wings of the midges get wet and the birds are forced to descend to hunt insects, writes TASS.
Different continents have their own folk signs.
Groundhog Day is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that on this day it is necessary to observe the marmot crawling out of its burrow in order to determine the time of the arrival of spring.
Unidentified oil spills found on beaches in northeastern Brazil
Oil spills of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
Pockets of pollution were scattered over two thousand kilometers of the coastline.
Reports of the first oil spills discovered began to arrive on the second of September.
However, every day until Thursday, their number, as well as territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Environment Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the identified samples.
It turned out that they are all identical and it is about crude oil.
The state oil corporation Petrobras, to which the found samples were transferred for analysis, said that in their composition they do not correspond to oil extracted from fields in Brazil.
&quot;This is thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it was caught in an ocean current, &quot;Rogerio Almeida, coordinator of the oil workers&#39; union of the states of Pernambuco and Paraiba, told the Brazilian news portal G1.
He also added that despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the northeast of the country, environmentalists found nine sea turtles completely covered in oil slick.
And only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin cleaning up polluted beaches.
In the meantime, the institute&#39;s experts recommend that tourists and local residents avoid oil spills and notify about all detected foci of pollution.
Medvedev instructed to revise the norms of work of catering enterprises
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev instructed Rospotrebnadzor, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Industry and Trade, together with the business ombudsman and the business community, to revise the sanitary and epidemiological rules and regulations for catering organizations.
They also have to study the issue of transition to the application of the requirements established by the technical regulations of the Eurasian Economic Union in catering.
The departments must submit their proposals to the government no later than October 15, according to the list of instructions of Mr. Medvedev following the results of the Dialogue program held on September 11 on the Russia 24 TV channel.
By the same deadline, Mr. Medvedev instructed all the aforementioned departments, in addition to the Ministry of Justice, to submit proposals for conducting an experiment from January 1, 2020 to limit control measures for catering organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and the Kaliningrad region.
By November 11, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economy were instructed to submit to the government a bill with amendments to the Administrative Code on the application of administrative suspension of activities for violation of requirements for catering, due to which harm was caused to health.
In addition, the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Economy, Rospotrebnadzor and the Ministry of Finance need to work out the issue of a gradual transition from 2021 to the formation of a consumer basket based on a basic set of products that allows you to form a full-fledged diet of healthy food.
Let us remind you that the business community started talking about the outdated norms of requirements after one cafe from the Anderson chain was closed.
The business community demanded to cancel the existing SanPiNs, Rospotrebnadzor announced the joint development of new ones.
The list includes 33 departments.
Meanwhile, Rospotrebnadzor intends to reduce the number of sanitary norms and rules 40 times by 2021.
Currently, operatives have information about three thefts, to which the detainee is involved.
A man operated in the Skuratovsky microdistrict of Tula.
He stole batteries and car radios from cars.
Of the two cars - VAZ-2106 and VAZ-2107 - the thief took the batteries, presumably for the purpose of further sale.
&quot;And from another car VAZ-2107 with the same purpose, the attacker took a car radio and a subwoofer,&quot; - said the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Tula region.
The attacker probably intended to resell the stolen goods.
Currently, a 26-year-old unemployed person has been detained.
Russians have nothing to save for their retirement - V. Matvienko
Speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that Russians do not have sufficient savings to ensure that the bill on a guaranteed pension product is fully operational in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions at the expense of personal savings is quite common in the world.
It&#39;s another matter how timely its introduction is in our country.
“In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has incomes, of which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase the pension provision in the future,” V. Matvienko said.
The Russians, according to the speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms of forming and calculating pensions, since &quot;constant changes in this area have completely confused them.&quot;
This does not mean that I am against the improvement of the pension system, which regulates its legislation.
“Russia is a social state, and we are obliged to do everything to improve the size of pensions and social security of citizens.
But steps in this direction must be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic realities, &quot;- V. Matvienko said to RIA Novosti.
The head of the Federation Council stressed that if this initiative (the bill on a guaranteed pension product) develops, then several basic principles must be provided, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and responsibility of the state for ensuring the safety of pension savings.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced the sending of a bill on a guaranteed pension product (GSP) for approval.
Among its main elements are an exclusively voluntary procedure for citizens to join the accumulation system, guaranteeing the safety of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registering citizens&#39; accumulation accounts by the central administrator, tax incentives for businesses and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU.
Sony and Disney have agreed
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption News of the beloved superhero&#39;s departure from the MCU has angered many loyal fans
One of the most famous comic book heroes - Spider-Man - will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures managed to negotiate the rights to use it in the films of the franchise.
This became known from a press release from Sony, which states that the third part of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
Earlier it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not come to a consensus on the division of income, because of which &quot;Spider-Man&quot; will leave the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony owns the rights to the movie hero.
She rented them out for Marvel films, which is owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony received revenue from box office revenue, and Disney from souvenirs and toys.
As reported, at some point, this situation ceased to suit Disney, and the company wanted to renegotiate the agreement.
Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said he was thrilled.
It&#39;s amazing that Spidey [Spider-Man ]&#39;s journey into the MCU will continue.
“All of us at Marvel Studios are very excited to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is an iconic figure.
This is a hero whose story affects all generations and audiences around the world, &quot;says his press release.
At the same time, Feige recalled that Sony is also creating its own cinematic universe, built just around Spider-Man.
“It just so happens that he is the only superpowered hero who finds himself in different MCUs.
So as long as Sony continues to develop its own Spidey universe, the future may come with unexpected surprises, &quot;he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted on his Instagram account an excerpt from the movie &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;, in which the hero of Leonardo DiCaprio shouts &quot;I&#39;m not leaving!&quot;
Information about the contradictions between the companies appeared in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to receive half of the box office revenue from Spider-Man films, provided that both companies would pay for half of the cost of producing the films.
But that didn&#39;t suit Sony.
The news of the possible departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has angered many loyal fans.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
As reported by CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the deal, but stated, “We have worked well for the past four years, and our shared desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many [Spider-Man] fans.
We are glad that we can go forward together. &quot;
The movie &quot;Avengers: Endgame&quot;, which united Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest-grossing film in the history of world cinema, displacing &quot;Avatar&quot; from the first place.

On Friday, September 27, in Poltava, the house of relatives of volunteer and blogger Andrei Karpov, known as Andrei Poltava, is being searched.
This was announced by the blogger himself on Facebook, noting that he does not live at this address.

The second similar explosive device planted in the car will be detonated today near the house of the famous Ukrainian propagandist Andrey Anatolyevich Karpov (aka Andrey Poltava) ...
Death to the punishers &quot;.
Karpov believes that his activities as a volunteer, politician and blogger are not to the liking of the Russian invaders.
Poltava subscribers are sure that he makes the necessary programs and wish him strength and friction.
Recall that Poltava is talking with the Russians about the war in Donbass, the annexation of Crimea, about peace, politics, and then uploads the video to the Internet.

Now he is broadcasting on the Pryamaya channel, where he harshly criticizes Russian propaganda.
In 2017, according to the ICTV channel, Karpov was recognized as the best blogger in Ukraine.

The chairman of the commission, Anneli Ott, noted that three hearings have been held in the commission so far.
Experts, entrepreneurs and representatives of the Ministry of the Environment presented their vision of achieving carbon neutrality in Estonia.

It is necessary to take into account the socio-economic impact of all changes, &quot;- said Sikkut.

Trade with Russia is not only about tanks
The trade turnover between Russia and India could double due to the geopolitical situation.
Deputy Director of the Confederation of Indian Industry Manish Kumar spoke about this at the 5th anniversary forum of small and medium-sized businesses in the regions of the SCO and BRICS countries.
It is important for us to learn from the SCO and BRICS countries, including Russia, - said the guest from Delhi.
- Our confederation has 9,000 direct members and 300,000 partner companies from 130 countries.
All of these are small and medium-sized businesses that cooperate with the countries of the Shanghai Organization.
And we are not standing still, but developing, and all these sanctions against Russia and the geopolitical situation in general only help us all grow.
Our bilateral trade now exceeds $ 10 billion, but these figures can be doubled.
First of all, due to new technologies in the field of healthcare, artificial intelligence and robotics.
Our trade is not only about tanks and heavy industry.
According to Manish Kumar, India has already established first contacts with modern centers in Russia.
Thus, a delegation from Delhi and other cities recently visited Skolkovo and Innopolis.
We signed a memorandum on the creation of systems in which it will be possible to build your modern business.
After all, entrepreneurship is not a whim, but a necessity.
A necessary step for us towards economic well-being.
We need to expand, attract small and medium-sized businesses, and together with Russia, China and other countries, we will definitely do this, - said the Indian industrialist.
Let us remind you that Ufa hosts the Forum of Small and Medium Business in the regions of the SCO and BRICS countries for the fifth time in a row.

As part of a working trip to Tobolsk, the Governor of the Tyumen Region Alexander Moor took part in the grand opening of the Sokolovsky water intake after reconstruction.
Now its productivity is 25 thousand cubic meters per day.
Reconstruction of the water intake took place within the framework of the federal project &quot;Clean Water&quot; under the national project &quot;Ecology&quot;.
Investors helped the authorities: the Sokolovsky water intake became another example of using the mechanism of public-private partnership.
The Tyumen region has a unique experience for the country of interaction in this area of federal structures, regional authorities, local administrations and a private investor.
New artesian wells have appeared at the facility.
Pumping stations were built above them.
Water purification and disinfection facilities were reconstructed.
As a result, the Sokolovsky water intake will provide Tobolyaks with high-quality drinking water.
There are plans to loop back the Sokolovsky and Zhukovsky water intakes.
Then Tobolsk will be able to completely switch to underground sources of water supply.
Wagay will expand water treatment facilities
In Congress, Trump&#39;s conversation with Zelensky saw &quot;Russian trace&quot;
In the lower house of the US Congress, the Russian Federation was accused of involvement in a scandal caused by a telephone conversation between the head of the White House, Donald Trump, and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.

The White House had to provide congressmen and the public with a transcript of the controversial conversation.

The expert told why it is worth giving up tea bags
A team of Canadian scientists from McGill University found that when a tea bag is brewed into a cup in five minutes, more than ten billion microplastic particles get into a cup.
Sawdust particles can also be added to the sachet drink, food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonova told Nation News.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of the tea bags - the manufacturer can add there ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
Sawdust is not thrown away at the end of the season, so it may end up in the tea.
&quot;Moreover, tea plants are not always included in bags,&quot; Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to abandon the use of such a drink in favor of tea by weight, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she emphasized that the danger of tea bags lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles are heated to high temperatures, because of which they can begin to release harmful substances.
&quot;It is best to buy pure green or black tea - such a drink will have the least amount of additives,&quot; the expert said.

Regions were invited to share the secrets of business support
As it became known to &quot;Parlamentskaya Gazeta&quot;, on September 27, the Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy Andrei Kutepov sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express their position on the initiatives of the subjects of the Federation to improve legislation in the field of supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SME).
It&#39;s time to establish inter-regional ties
The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy has summarized the information received from the regions on their programs for business development and the legalization of the self-employed, as well as on the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals for improving the current legislation.
&quot;To date, communication between the regions is not well established, as a result of which the business community in all regions visited by the senators raised the issue of the lack of information on regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the country as a whole,&quot; stated Andrey Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments in the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and problems (available to the editorial office).
In addition to the relevant ministries, summary data from the regions were also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positively implemented developments in the regions could give an impetus to the development of entrepreneurship in general.
The first step towards such an exchange will be the direction of information available to the Committee on Economic Policy, &quot;the senator told the Parliamentary Gazette.
Useful experience
Today, in many regions of the country, programs to support small and medium-sized businesses have been adopted and are successfully operating.
For example, in the Vologda Oblast, there is an Entrepreneurship Support Center, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in certifying finished products.
In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed, which provides for the implementation of the principle of one window through multifunctional centers.
In the Krasnodar Territory, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided grants at the expense of the regional budget.
There is a cluster development center in the Oryol region.
The Amur Region within the framework of the federal project &quot;Acceleration of small and medium-sized businesses&quot; provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state coworking centers at the expense of the federal budget.
And in a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
The self-employed continue to be brought out of the shadows
According to the regional authorities, in order to more effectively support small and medium-sized businesses, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term &quot;self-employment&quot; with &quot;entrepreneurial activity&quot;, since this &quot;is most consistent with the content of the state service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens.&quot;
In the Ivanovo region, they consider it necessary to make amendments to expand the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for the decoration and repair of residential premises, summer cottages, and physical training.
The Bryansk Region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers using the Mercury veterinary system.
And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions they are advocating the consolidation of the concept of &quot;social entrepreneurship&quot; and the directions of support for social entrepreneurship in the legal framework.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account when preparing state programs for supporting small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills.
&quot;All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills,&quot; Andrei Kutepov assured.
Airline Helps Passengers Avoid Crying Children Neighborhood
Air carrier Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new feature: when booking seats on the plane, you can now see where small children will be seated.
Now, if desired, the neighborhood with them can be avoided.
Passengers of the Japanese airline Japan Airlines (JAL) were able to take advantage of the new option and avoid unwanted neighborhood with small children.
The air carrier has launched a function that allows you to track where children will sit.
When choosing seats in the cabin while booking tickets, passengers will be able to see the image of the child&#39;s head in the seats occupied by children aged eight days to two years.
Thus, those who do not want to fly next to babies because of the possible inconvenience associated with their crying, can sit as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the airline&#39;s services were delighted with the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the users complained that a few weeks ago he flew from New York to Doha, and three crying children were sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested introducing &quot;flights only for adults&quot;, expressing his willingness to pay extra for such a flight.
Many tourists noted that now they will try to always choose Japan Airlines for their travels, since they do not see anything pleasant in flying next to a crying child in an enclosed space.
Earlier, a woman traveling with a baby tried to placate fellow travelers on a flight from Seoul to San Francisco.
She prepared a bag of sweets for each of the 200 passengers, each containing a note of apology.

On the walls of the carriages one can see rare archival photographs and stills from films.
Russian gays with adopted children seek asylum in the United States

Pavel Ustinov joined the pickets in support of the persons involved in the &quot;Moscow case&quot;
Actor Pavel Ustinov has joined a series of one-man pickets &quot;Freedom for all&quot;, which are being held on Friday near the building of the Russian presidential administration on Staraya Square in Moscow, an Interfax correspondent reports.
A series of pickets began on September 18 in support of Ustinov himself and has continued every day since then.
At present, the protesters, replacing each other, stand holding a poster with the inscription &quot;Freedom to all&quot; and the names of those convicted and arrested after uncoordinated rallies in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, the poster includes the names of Yegor Zhukov, Kirill Zhukov, Danil Beglets, Evgeny Kovalenko, Konstantin Kotov, Ivan Podkopaev, Aidar Gubaidulin, Alexei Minyailo, Sergei Fomin, Samariddin Vladjabov, Nikita Chirtsov, Eduard Malyshevsky.
On September 16, the Tverskoy Court of Moscow sentenced 24-year-old Ustinov to 3.5 years in a general regime colony on charges of using violence against an OMON soldier of the Russian Guard at an uncoordinated rally on August 3 in central Moscow (part 2 of article 318 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After that, on September 20, at the request of the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office, the court changed Ustinov&#39;s measure of restraint from detention to a recognizance not to leave the place.
Thus, the petition for the release of Ustinov received more than 112 thousand signatures per day.
Theater and film artists started a flash mob in support of a colleague.
On September 18, a queue lined up to take part in a solo picket in solidarity with the actor.
Human rights activists, journalists, scientists, teachers, doctors, Orthodox priests demanded that the case be reconsidered.
As Ustinov&#39;s sister Yulia told Interfax, her brother does not plan to speak at a rally on September 29 in the capital in support of the defendants in the &quot;Moscow case&quot;.
Sanctions shipments to Russia fell 100 times
The government of the Russian Federation calculated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries that fell under the Russian food embargo decreased since 2013 by more than 100 times.
According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from the sanctioned countries against 3 million 442.2 thousand tons in the same period in 2013, Interfax reports.
At the same time, the cost of imported products decreased to $ 226.5 million from $ 4 billion 975.5 million, respectively.
We are talking about the supply of goods that did not fall under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the dropped volumes of products prohibited for import were compensated by an increase in imports from the CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Serbia.
Recall that at the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020, the validity of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from being imported into Russia as part of counter-sanctions.
In a document posted on the official portal of legal information, it was noted that the rules were extended for one more year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the order to destroy the sanction was applied to products from the USA, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein &quot;joined&quot; this list, and from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine.
A decree signed by Putin on the destruction of the &quot;sanctions&quot; (products that fell under the food embargo that Moscow imposed in response to the West&#39;s anti-Russian sanctions), which was illegally imported into the country, came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government allowed to destroy the &quot;sanctioned&quot; food in any legal way.
As the sanctions of the West persisted, the Russian Federation also extended its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, this measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov previously called the destruction of food &quot;simply immoral&quot;, and this, in his words, has a negative impact on the upbringing of people.
Moreover, in early June, Rospotrebnadzor came up with an initiative to prohibit the destruction of foodstuffs fit for consumption.
After that, a similar recommendation to the government was made by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.
And the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Alexei Gordeev said that it is wrong to destroy food products, and we need to think about how to use them for their intended purpose, having evaluated the quality.
Firm CEO found guilty of tax evasion
By the verdict of the Leninsky District Court of the city of Cheboksary, the director of LLC &quot;Land and Law&quot; Vyacheslav Morozov was found guilty of committing crimes under paragraph &quot;b&quot; of Part 2 of Art. 199 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (tax evasion from an organization by including deliberately false information in the tax return, committed on an especially large scale) and Part 2 of Art. 327 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (falsification of an official document granting rights and releasing from obligations, in order to use it, committed in order to conceal another crime and facilitate its commission).
This was reported by the press service of the Investigative Department of the TFR in Chuvashia.
From January 2008 to December 2009, Vyacheslav Morozov entered information on outstanding transactions in the tax accounting documents of the LLC.
According to the fictitious documents, the company incurred additional costs, and, therefore, the amount of value added taxes and corporate income taxes payable was reduced by 11.2 million rubles.
Vyacheslav Morozov was sentenced to 3.5 years&#39; suspended imprisonment.

Chile starts building a telescope worth 1 billion euros
This was reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, construction of the dome of the building has officially begun this week, which will house the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project so far.
Its total cost is estimated by ESO to exceed one billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, which will be about 39 meters in diameter.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflective surfaces with diameters of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT take the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and also look for Earth twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A *, a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has just begun, scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total cost was about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
