Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
India&#39;s new prime minister, Narendra Modi, is meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, in Tokyo to discuss economic and security ties as part of his first major overseas visit since winning elections in May.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world&#39;s third largest economy.
Plans to expand nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
India also reportedly hopes for a defense cooperation agreement between the two states.
FANO Russia will hold the final Expert session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FASO of Russia), together with the Russian Academy of Sciences, will hold the third Expert Session &quot;Evaluating the Effectiveness of Scientific Organizations.&quot;
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency throughout the year, according to a press release received by Lenta.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to summarize the results of the work of the Expert Session for the year and form a final list of indicators for assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Separately, the event participants plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for evaluating the work of scientific groups, and the criteria for conducting evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to form a common approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the final version of the regulatory documents is being coordinated.
Based on the results of the next session, we must complete the formation of the processes of scientometric and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment, &quot;said Elena Aksenova, head of the expert and analytical department of FANO Russia.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than a hundred scientific institutes of Russia.
Following its results, a resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 am Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow, Solyanka Street, 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical uniformities in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow looking for relatives among the stars, that is, those that have arisen from the same cluster.
The authors published the results of their research in the journal Nature, and a brief summary of them can be found on the university website.
The reason for the similar chemical composition of nearby stars is the turbulent mixing in clouds of gas that precedes the formation of stars.
Even if a star is born then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can be used to determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of relative stars.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical abundance from that of its relatives in the cluster.
Modeling results from astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, experts using a supercomputer modeled two streams of interstellar gas, which together formed a cloud.
Over the course of several million years, this object under the influence of its own gravity is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists have added markers to the original gas streams and have found that a high degree of chemical homogeneity is achieved through rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud.
According to astrophysicists, their study proves that it is possible to search for stars-relatives by chemical composition, as well as to determine the possible regions of formation of such objects.
Karrata police arrest 20-year-old after chasing motorcycle at high speed
The motorcycle was confiscated after being driven at 125 km / h in the 70 km / h area and across the bushland to hide from police in Pilbara.
A transport police patrol in Karrat this morning attempted to stop a blue motorcycle after finding the speed of 125 km / h as it exited the service station on Bathgate Road.
Police say the motorcyclist did not stop and continued down Burgess Road, then turned into the bushland, causing the police to lose sight of him.
A motorcycle and a person matching the driver&#39;s description were seen near a home on Walcott Way in Bulgarr.
The Karrata police charged the 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and dangerous driving.
He is due to appear before the Karrata Magistrate&#39;s Court on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.
The academic year in the DPR will begin no earlier than October
On September 1, the academic year in the DPR will not begin, since there are only 10% of children in the region.
This was announced by the Minister of Education and Science of the self-proclaimed republic Igor Kostenok.
According to him, 11% of schoolchildren went to other regions of Ukraine, 20% to Russia.
Education in schools in the territory controlled by the DPR will begin no earlier than October 1.
However, teachers will return to work on September 1.
Investigation of the TU-204 disaster at Vnukovo in 2012 has been completed
The Investigative Committee of Russia completed its investigation of the criminal case into the crash of the Tu-204 aircraft at Vnukovo airport in December 2012.
This was reported today in the RF IC.
&quot;The Moscow Interregional Investigation Directorate for Transport of the Investigative Committee of Russia has completed the investigation of the criminal case initiated in connection with the crash of the TU-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline at Vnukovo airport on December 29, 2012, on the grounds of a crime under Part 3 of Article 263 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation / violation of traffic safety rules and the operation of air transport, resulting in the death of two or more persons by negligence / &quot;, the ministry said in a statement.
The cause of the disaster was the crew&#39;s failure to comply with standard procedures and the increased approach speed.
George Webster accused of rape in hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
The man will stand trial on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, faces charges during a High Court hearing in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman at the Scotland&#39;s Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
Webster is said to have attacked her while she was &quot;unconscious, asleep and unable to consent.&quot;
In addition, Webster is accused of raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, in the Scottish Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Ray has scheduled a hearing in the High Court in Edinburgh for 17 November.
Lavrov: Russia will not &quot;slam the door&quot; in connection with the new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not &quot;slam the door&quot; in connection with the new sanctions.
This was announced today by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
As for our response to the event of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even argue, fantasize, because everything must be specifically calculated, - he said.
And when we understand what the European and American partners will be able to do this time, then we will make decisions on how to respond to this.
This will not be associated with slamming doors, some kind of offense, falsely understood, - stressed the minister.
First of all, we will build on our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners regarding their adequacy, negotiability and reliability.
By the steps that are being taken in the field of sanctions, one can very well judge what the partners are striving for, ”the Russian Foreign Minister continued.
If they say in a loud voice that &quot;they will also be painful for us, but we have to go for it in order to punish Russia,&quot; this is probably not very adequate. &quot;
As for the WTO, the RF will withdraw in response to possible new sanctions, then no.
On the contrary, we want to actively master the WTO tools, including when it comes to trade disputes, ”Lavrov said.
We have already used this toolkit to overcome what we believe to be discriminatory EU anti-dumping policies.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and, at the same time, anti-dumping measures are being used against sectors of the Russian economy.
&quot;We are ready to engage the WTO mechanisms in order to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the norms of the EU&#39;s third energy package retrospectively,&quot; Lavrov said.
How to use lilacs correctly in garden design?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since lilac after flowering loses its main attractiveness, it is advisable to plant it together with other shrubs.
It goes well with many cultures.
Moreover, next to the lilac, you can and should plant both decorative plants at other times, and blooming at the same time.
Another plus of lilac is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a standard tree of various heights, an improved bush, a bush with a wide base, and even a kind of garden bonsai - a tree with a bizarrely curved stem.
Just choose the shape that best suits your garden design.
In Karelia, a resident of the Leningrad region was convicted of selling counterfeit money
According to the republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal business in the Olonets and Segezha regions.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already managed to inherit in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man was brought before the Olonets district court.
And to complete the investigation of the crimes committed in our republic, he was convoyed to Segezha.
In the course of the investigation, it was proven guilty for several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money dating back to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the materials of the criminal case with the indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court ruled to replace the term of imprisonment with four years in a general regime colony.
The verdict did not come into legal force.
Let us remind you that two more sellers of counterfeit money were convicted last week, which they used to pay in stores in Petrozavodsk.
Citizens of Azerbaijan also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is imprisoned for five years, the other for four.
Each of them was fined 500 thousand rubles.
The verdict has not yet entered into legal force.
The 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first &quot;Dervish&quot; convoy was celebrated in Arkhangelsk
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
&quot;Dervish&quot; delivered military aid to the USSR from the United States and Great Britain.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial rally was held at the foundation stone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedov embankment in Solombala.
The event brought together representatives of Arkhangelsk veterans&#39; organizations, children from the cadet class.
We met for the first time twenty-three years ago, when the foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time, today&#39;s event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who were not returned by the sea, &quot;said Boris Karpov, Chairman of the Council of Veterans of the Northern Shipping Company.
Then the city brass band performed at the event, and the pupils of the cadet classes presented flowers to the veterans and marched with the flags of Russia and the banner of Victory.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers at the foundation stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of uniform boots, tin, wool and many other implements and equipment).
In addition, there were military equipment and weapons on board - 3,800 depth charges and magnetic mines, fifteen Hurricane fighters, disassembled.
At the same time, the escort of the convoy consisted of 16 ships of the British Navy, among which there were two aircraft carriers.
The convoy of ships was not detected by the enemy and safely reached its destination - Arkhangelsk.
In total, 126 transport and about 50 warships were killed out of 848 ships that took part in the vital operations to conduct caravans.

A total of 11 authors participate in the festival.
Next year, its participants plan to exhibit at the Russian level, according to the press service of the city administration.
Recalling the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation that would protect union organization as a civil right.
&quot;Where there are unions, there are middle class jobs,&quot; says Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who co-chairs the Progressive Faction Congress.
This is why I am proud to present the Workers&#39; Empowerment Act, along with the civil rights movement symbol, John Lewis.
This groundbreaking bill will give workers the same legal options for discriminating against union organizations as for other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of union opponents
Amending the Labor Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for membership in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and receive damages and fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
However, this is clearly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Allison, Lewis, and the co-sponsors of the bill are proposing is to think back to a very American thought.
Despite the attacks unions have received in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country - Americans once supported countries around the world to accept, expand, and respect labor rights.
There was a time that is still remembered by millions of Americans, when this country simultaneously defended democracy, free speech, freedom of the press, and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country pass a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Tojo&#39;s militarized autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware of the role of workers and their unions in shaping the new Japan, they included text that explicitly recognized that &quot;the workers&#39; right to organize and to bargain and to act collectively is guaranteed.&quot;
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that ensured that Adolf Hitler&#39;s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers will need to organize and be heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that openly read: “The right to form associations to protect and improve labor and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to prejudice this right will not be legally enforceable; measures aimed at these purposes will be declared illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights that drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included the assurance that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect their interests. &quot;
For generations, Americans have taken for granted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country consulted other countries on how to build civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize - and to have this union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - must be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is indeed wise to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Everyone now knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions, the unions have miraculously created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers, as it should for us.
Formally recognizing labor rights as human rights - and expanding civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against union organization - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reviving the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
Judge temporarily blocks a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the enactment of a Louisiana law that supporters say will likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
The measure, which was signed into law by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Ginadl in June and was set to take effect on September 1, would require abortion doctors to have hospital admission authority within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge&#39;s decision means that for now, doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while continuing to seek such authority.
&quot;Plaintiffs will be allowed to operate legally while continuing to gain authority,&quot; Judge John DeGravels wrote in his decision.
A hearing will be scheduled within a month in which the judge will make a more permanent decision on this law.
Abortion advocates have welcomed the ruling, the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures, saying it will give doctors more time to get hospital powers.
&quot;Today&#39;s ruling ensures that Louisiana women are protected from an insidious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,&quot; said Nancy Northup, president and director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed a suspension lawsuit on behalf of three of the five state clinics.
It was not immediately obvious whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who were not plaintiffs in this case and also applied for admission powers.
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, and courts recently ruled such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key pieces of Texas law that would close most of the state&#39;s remaining clinics were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion rights activists, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admission authority laws impose unnecessary medical restrictions on doctors.
Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women&#39;s health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one physician who performs abortions in Louisiana has admission authority at a hospital, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing this procedure, that doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing the procedure, the group said.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish abortion doctors while their applications for admission authority were pending.
What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products lead to?
At least half of the products for each type of product in the assortment of retail chains should be made in Russia, says Oleg Nilov, a State Duma deputy from the Just Russia faction.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, the newspaper Izvestia writes.
The document will still be detailed in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. &lt;...&gt; For the rest of the product groups that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers, &quot;Nilov told the publication.
Together with amendments to the article &quot;On the Basics of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation&quot;, the draft law envisages amending the Tax Code, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the sale of products manufactured in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in retail chains is included in the stimulus package for Russian manufacturers.
Several times more domestic goods will appear on the shelves.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to Sergei Litvinenko, a lawyer for Nalogovik, a member of the Public Duma, an independent expert center, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
Agricultural producers, farmers and small shops will be in the black.
They will be able to sell more, which means that profits will rise.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices to retailers, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian manufacturers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will result in higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some will be developed faster, and a contribution will be made to GDP growth.
Russia&#39;s dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, though not immediately, &quot;the expert notes.
Previously, Russian enterprises often could not break through to the shelves of local stores due to high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now, after the imposition of the embargo, this niche has become vacant and one can breathe a sigh of relief.
But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, now is the &quot;moment of calm&quot;, when the old players have already left, and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, we can talk about an increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as an increase in prices for finished products, &quot;- said to AiF.ru the first vice-president of the all-Russian public organization&quot; Russian club of financial directors &quot;, Ph.D. Tamara Kasyanova.
Undoubtedly, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will allow the sector to be assigned to local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that are cheaper due to subsidies from another state.
In other words, the struggle for a buyer will unfold between companies operating under the same industry laws.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian manufacturers are not able to satisfy 50% of the domestic needs of their compatriots in all respects.
And in this situation, retail chains will have to &quot;hold out&quot; the share of Russian goods to half of the range.
In this regard, there are growing fears that substandard goods will arrive on the shelves.
Perhaps, under the guise of products made in Russia, foreign products with broken labels will be supplied, &quot;the expert adds.
Large retail chains, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers, will feel the negative effect of the introduction of quotas.
It is logical that in this situation foreign suppliers themselves will suffer, since the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods may affect consumers as well.
The fact is that some Russian-made products may be inferior in quality to imported counterparts, while stores will be able to raise prices for the latter, as for a scarce commodity.
The idea of import substitution, forgotten in the early 2000s, was revived by economists in February this year due to the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of abandoning imported products is becoming even more urgent.
The law is intended to oblige retailers to reckon with domestic manufacturers when placing orders with suppliers.
Then we will move much faster and more confidently along the path of import substitution, and the production planning system for the required types of products will be created in a shorter time, &quot;says the deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be especially effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is especially high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really capable of completely covering the counters of Russian stores.
In addition, meat production can receive a powerful impetus.
As you know, the largest share of imports is kept for beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% is still accounted for by Russian products, &quot;says Kasyanova.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will contribute to import substitution and may speed up this process.
However, this initiative in itself will not lead to import substitution, since this requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is sure.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be brought from abroad, which means that a full-fledged import substitution will not occur, but significant steps in this direction will be taken.
In addition, it is not enough to set quotas; it is still necessary to establish the production of domestic products in the country in order to fulfill these quotas.
These quotas will provide just such guarantees, &quot;the expert says.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean more ovarian cancer kills in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video in memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who forgive in rural Australia face a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those in urban areas.
Researchers analyzed disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent survived five years after being diagnosed.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research said those who live in the regions and remote areas of the state are 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those who live in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New Drugs May Slow Lung Cancer and Ovarian Cancer
Researchers have traced the medical path of women over seven years.
Dr Jordan said the woman&#39;s age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, current medical conditions, and socioeconomic status also influenced the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those with advanced cancer at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
Those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those who lived in urban areas.
While the study was not intended to determine why women living outside urban areas are more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr Jordan suggested that late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
“This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly located in big cities,” she said.
While improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of out-of-home services that allow professionals to treat women closer to home and support programs for people far from home could help.
Dr Jordan said that regardless of geographic location, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, highlighting the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The research, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young Gold Coast mother, Elisha Niv, was told she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open its doors in the Kuzhenersky district
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaybeljak began in April this year and was carried out according to a standard design.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Head of Mari El, financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the constructed medical and prophylactic institution is almost 230 square meters.
It will provide medical care to residents of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaybelyak and the villages of Dementyevo, Pyuncheryumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraibelyak, Shinur and Chashkayal.
The new feldsher-obstetric center will replace the existing FAP, the building of which was built in 1918 and has long since exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new institution will open shortly.
Novocheboksarka who killed her four-month-old son while intoxicated to face trial
A resident of Chuvashia will be in the dock for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksary, the investigation of a criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by negligence, has been completed.
The investigation established that on July 26 this year, the accused, together with her four-month-old son, came to Cheboksary to celebrate the birthday of her kuma&#39;s child.
After a long feast, Novocheboksarka decided to stay at a party and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, the drunk woman put him next to her on the bed to breastfeed, but soon fell asleep.
During sleep, the woman leaned on her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, according to the press service of the Investigative Directorate of the ICR in Chuvashia, has been sent to the court.
Inflation is out of vacation.
Will Russians feel the sharp rise in prices?
As a result of cross-sanctions between the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not meet the authorities&#39; forecasts, analysts at VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed consequences of the anti-sanctions will lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year and even less - 6.5%.
However, according to the Kommersant newspaper, this week the Ministry of Economic Development is to make &quot;small but fundamental&quot; adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.
According to the newspaper, the department may lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zeroing of income growth.
The forecast assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation were in effect for a year - until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation presupposes a one-time shock, but the downward trend in inflation will not change, &quot;a source in the Ministry of Finance told the newspaper.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the financial and economic block of the government regarding inflation and predict a rise in prices in 2014 at the level of 8%.
The main effect of food bans will come with the possible introduction of sales tax (EPT) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflationary peak of 9% will occur in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will decline, experts say.
By the way, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation imposed &quot;neat sanctions.&quot;
AiF.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department of FC AForex:
The rise in prices is already observed in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially significant products began to rise in price, the government was forced to launch measures of systemic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unreasonable price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason initiates price increases.
The key factors behind the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the colossal rate of capital outflow, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, internal conversion due to population flight into foreign currency, as well as the embargo on the import of food products from countries that have joined sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressures were kept under control, the cost of a basket of minimum food items would not have jumped 12% in just one quarter.
The ban on the import of food products provoked a supply shock on the domestic market and led to a completely logical increase in the final cost.
Since at the current stage we are unable to fully launch the import substitution mechanism, as well as increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, retaliatory sanctions will continue to carry the risks of an increase in the inflationary component.
If we add here also the fiscal reasons associated with the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the deteriorated prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year inflation may well exceed 8%.
Alexander Razuvaev, director of the analytical department, Alpari
In the 90s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, in the 2000s it was also higher than the current level, another thing is that then this was offset by rapid economic growth.
I think by the end of the year inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Platon Maguta, asset manager of MC &quot;Maguta Fund&quot;
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is so far successfully contained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, primarily on the financial sector, this may lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally manifested in purchases of hard currency in order to to secure your savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the gradual depreciation of the ruble, both by market methods and by government regulation.
But the rise in prices traditionally begins after the summer lull and, perhaps, this fall will become more noticeable.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5% is likely to withstand, since the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Horticultural centers grieve over declining homeowners
This drop, driven by an exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under 35, could see horticultural centers begin to lose tens of millions of pounds a year as today&#39;s young consumers reach &quot;basic horticultural age,&quot; according to HTA research reported by the Financial Times.
Renters spend an average of 55 percent of what homeowners spend on gardening, according to this report.
It cites an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of paving front yard parking lots and shrinking garden sizes as other threats to the industry, which has an estimated £ 5 billion in annual sales.
Greater London, where homeownership fell from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, has the lowest spending on gardeners per household in the UK.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society said that renting a home and a lack of garden space doesn&#39;t mean people can&#39;t grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticultural advisor at RHS, said: &quot;Growing plants in containers, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move.&quot;
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the &quot;golden age&quot; of horticultural retail as a result of increased homeownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year thanks to better weather following unfavorable conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria carried out a massive cleanup in the Agriculture Fund
Three of the four heads of the Agriculture Fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Agriculture Fund were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture announced only the dismissal of the executive director Atanas Dobrev.
His place was taken by Lozana Vasileva.
It turned out that on Friday, two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were also quietly replaced.
Deputy executive director Tatyana Angelova, who until that time was responsible for state aid and the SAPARD program, was released, BGNES reports with reference to the Trud newspaper.
I did not attend the fund&#39;s board of directors because we are not members of the management by law, but I was informed later that I had been released.
I cannot say why my dismissal is not reported on the foundation&#39;s website.
I am on vacation.
I hope to find out more on Monday, &quot;Angelova told the publication.
She will be replaced by Ivanka Bagdatova, who until now was the head of Investment Lending at the central fund in Agriculture in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Up to this point, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
In his place will be appointed Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the Agriculture Fund in the city of Veliko Tarnovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the fund, Atije Aliyeva-Veli, retained her post.
She is currently responsible for the Rural Development Program.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey summons US diplomat over espionage report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry called in the country&#39;s most senior US diplomat for clarification on the report on US and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US chargé d&#39;affaires and Turkish officials discussed the message on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show Turkey has been a top intelligence target for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news outlets, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the message, saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
Earlier reports that Germany&#39;s main intelligence agency had also targeted Ankara for intelligence has elicited a more angry response from the Turkish government.
Major Chinese companies team up against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China&#39;s largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networks, messengers, etc.) and Baidu (China&#39;s largest search engine), are creating a company that will compete with Alibaba in the online market.
However, catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left even its American rivals eBay and Amazon.com behind, will not be easy.
Union of the largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($ 814 million) in the joint venture, 70% owned by Wanda and 15% by each of the Internet companies, Wanda Group said in a statement.
It is planned to register a company in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will combine search services Baidu with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a chain of 40 luxury hotels, the Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial properties throughout China and 40 shopping centers.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (over $ 8 billion) to build a movie studio and theme park in Qingdao, a city in eastern China on the Yellow Sea.
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate a profit of $ 960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings, making it the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all of its shopping malls, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, which will be developed by a new competitor Alibaba.
Thanks to the merger, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year, according to Dong Tse, who will lead the new company.
The new site should become the world&#39;s largest online-to-offline platform, said Dong Tse.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract online shoppers to come to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is coupon services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
&quot;O2O is the biggest pie in online commerce,&quot; said Wanda CEO Wang Jianlin (quoted by Bloomberg).
&quot;Now there is no real O2O site in China, and in this situation, the chances for everyone are approximately equal,&quot; he said.
China&#39;s e-commerce market is the largest in the world, and according to McKinsey &amp; Co.&#39;s estimates, its volume will more than triple by 2015 compared to 2011, to $ 395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, according to official statistics from Bloomberg: this is more than the population of any country in the world, with the exception of India.
And according to forecasts, by 2015 this number may grow to 850 million people.
Union of the richest
Tencent CEO Ma Huateng was until recently the richest man in China, but according to the Bloomberg Millionaire Index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already surpassed him by $ 5.5 billion.
Jack Ma&#39;s fortune is estimated at $ 21.8 billion, of which $ 11 billion comes from his stake in Alibaba.
Baidu CEO Robin Li is now China&#39;s third richest man, while Wanda&#39;s Wang Jianlin is ranked fourth.
&quot;This battle is very interesting to watch: the three richest people join forces to challenge the even richer,&quot; Cao Lei, director of China&#39;s e-commerce research center in Hangzhou, told Bloomberg.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately after creation: &quot;Rome cannot be built overnight.&quot;
The fact that it is not so easy to compete with Alibaba not only for new companies, but also for the well-deserved leaders of the global Internet commerce, is evidenced by the report on financial performance of Alibaba for the last quarter published the day before.
Alibaba is often described as a cross between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company made more money than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba&#39;s net profit for the period almost doubled that of competitors - it almost tripled year-on-year to $ 1.99 billion.
&quot;Alibaba still has tremendous potential for generating money, thanks in large part to its mobile applications,&quot; an analyst with Hong Kong-based Arete Research Service commented to Bloomberg on the report.
According to the updated prospectus of Alibaba on the website of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company&#39;s services in July was 188 million, significantly exceeding the March figure of 163 million people.
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions for the past quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba is to name its share price ahead of its IPO.
According to the average valuation of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $ 187 billion after the sale of the shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba may debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as early as September 16.
The company&#39;s road-show leading up to this event kicks off on September 3.
Alibaba&#39;s IPO is expected to be a record in NYSE history and will allow the company to raise about $ 20 billion.
Until now, the record for the volume of funds raised on the US stock exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 carried out an initial public offering of its shares, earning $ 17.9 billion on this.
At least half of the food products in retail chains should be of Russian origin, State Duma deputies believe.
They have developed a bill on this topic.
We are talking about amending Art. 8 of the Federal Law &quot;On the Basics of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation&quot; and in the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of domestically produced products in stores should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in winter, so a &quot;discount&quot; will be made for them in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% on the sale of all food products, the country of origin of which is Russia, the Izvestia newspaper reports.
On August 27, a draft law on amendments to the Federal Law &quot;On Retail Markets&quot; was submitted to the lower house of parliament, which proposes to revive farmers&#39; markets in Russia, where small producers can sell their products.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials from the municipality of Calvia to the office of the Mallorca state attorney on Friday.
The police chief of Calvia on the resort island of Mallorca was arrested following allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious Magaluf center of rampant drunkenness.
Chief Inspector Jose Antonio Navarro was taken into custody following corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf&#39;s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials from the municipality of Calvia to the office of Mallorca&#39;s anti-corruption prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish National Guard on corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say government protectionism is seriously affecting their businesses.
&quot;It&#39;s not about making money anymore, it&#39;s about surviving,&quot; one of the businessmen told the court.
We cannot jeopardize our livelihoods.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer after a hit YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British vacationer giving 24 men blowjobs during a bar run.
The island&#39;s authorities have since tried to end drunkenness among Magaluf vacationers by minimizing the number of notorious alcoholic bar races.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the blowjob incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and Carnage bar run organizers were fined € 55,000 ($ 73,000) together.
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular with young British holidaymakers, has also been the site of numerous drunken accidents associated with the crazy fun known as &quot;balconing&quot; where people jump from balcony to balcony or from balcony to hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights at Adelaide Airport
SPRING has prepared a chilly surprise in southern South Australia with heavy rains and high winds that have impacted Adelaide Airport flights.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city in the evening at 9 pm, following 6.6 mm, which fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short showers with gusty winds, including a thunderstorm that started just before 8pm and poured out almost 4mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter kicked off an early squeeze of spring last week, temperatures dropped again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city.
The squalling conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of Virgin Airlines&#39; flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land on schedule just after 7:30 pm, but was caught in a wind shear zone - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to climb.
Wind gusts reached 50 km / h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to climb on a second landing, and the plane eventually landed at around 8:40 pm.
The delay in this flight caused a subsequent delay on several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.
A high of 16C is forecast for Adelaide on Tuesday with the likelihood of one or two showers.
The calculation of the estimate of construction projects in the Russian Federation will be carried out in a new way
The Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control over the issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems of connecting to networks.
An expert council for the development of competition in the construction sector has been created under the FAS.
At its meeting, Vadim Solovyov, head of the department for control of housing and communal services, construction and natural resources of the FAS, said that &quot;today&#39;s calculation of the estimate for construction projects is absolutely incomprehensible.
The regulatory framework makes pricing nontransparent and can lead to unreasonable construction costs, according to the FAS.
And they propose to determine the cost of construction of state property at the design stage on the basis of market prices for design solutions instead of the estimated standards and unit prices for technological operations used today.
These proposals have been included in the &quot;road map&quot; and are now being considered by the Ministry of Construction.
&quot;Replacing traditional cost estimates in construction with calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,&quot; Vadim Solovyov explained to RSL.
After all, now every bolt and nut is calculated in the estimate, and it is not always possible to check everything, therefore sometimes unscrupulous construction companies can bury &quot;whole tractors&quot; in the documentation.
The Ministry of Construction agrees with the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
&quot;The first developments on the transition to the calculation of the cost of structural elements already exist: methods have been developed for calculating prices for structural solutions, drawing up estimates for these indicators,&quot; Elena Zhukova, head of the department of urban planning and architecture of the Ministry of Construction, told the RSL.
The field of road construction was chosen as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the construction company Profi-Invest Anatoly Demyanko told &quot;RSL&quot;, the estimated standards are outdated long ago, but the business has not yet been offered another mechanism.
“As for the proposed calculations for structural elements, in practice it is difficult to implement, since the construction of buildings often uses completely different technologies,” he said.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing largely thanks to government orders.
According to Ekaterina Lezina, Chairman of the Board of the Non-Commercial Partnership &quot;Expert Community of State Order Professionals&quot;, today the state is the most solvent customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, deputy director for engineering at the Rosatom capital construction industry center, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and companies that have monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors to enter this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is maximally protected from someone&#39;s control.
At the expert council, it was proposed to form a state order system in such a way that one and the same contractor is not entitled to receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion rubles. or several contracts worth more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry of Construction believes that this approach must be assessed in terms of the impact on the business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case it will be necessary to endow the customer with the functions of a general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the number of the customer&#39;s staff and budgetary expenses for its maintenance.
At the same time, the customer&#39;s specialists will have to have the knowledge to assess the quality of work performed by contractors, as well as their safety.
Often times, such a breakdown will need to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may entail an outflow of highly qualified public procurement participants due to lack of interest in obtaining a government order for an incomplete volume of work and a small contract amount.
Alexander Yevstashenkov, deputy head of the Procurement Institute&#39;s Expert and Consulting Center, believes that now the state order procedure has turned into a business game for the attentiveness of the contractor.
And he gave the following example: &quot;when filling out the application, the participant must indicate&quot; specific indicators &quot;without specifying the words:&quot; or equivalent &quot;,&quot; must be &quot;,&quot; from &quot;,&quot; more &quot;,&quot; less &quot;,&quot; analogue &quot;,&quot; or &quot;, &quot;type&quot;, &quot;similar type&quot;, &quot;not lower&quot;, &quot;lower&quot;, &quot;higher&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;may have&quot;, &quot;maybe&quot;, &quot;earlier&quot;, &quot;not earlier&quot;, &quot;not higher&quot;, &quot;not allowed&quot;, etc.
Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of the application submitted by contractors.
Another problem of 44-FZ, according to Evstashenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work through the participant&#39;s &quot;paper&quot; proposal at the stage of filing an application.
Considering the application of the participant, it is really possible to assess only the qualifications of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, which has not even been started yet, the expert believes.
The quality of work can only be assessed upon acceptance.
The expert council also proposed to move the margin income from the upper to the lower echelon so that intermediate contractors disappear.
The chairman of the expert council, state secretary, deputy head of the FAS Andrei Tsarikovsky believes that this should not be done, since the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it will turn out, as in the famous reprise of Arkady Raikin &quot;Atelier&quot;: &quot;Are there any claims to buttons?&quot;
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went to school again on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mines rained down on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the territory was being rebuilt from the fighting.
The start of school brought joy and excitement to the missile-hit settlements in southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff at the Pashosh kindergarten, hit by a rocket, removed the traces of debris from the walls and children&#39;s slides before the students arrived.
“We&#39;re a little scared, but we look forward to the future with joy,” said Ronit Barth, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to get back to a measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was &quot;a little weird&quot; to suddenly start going to school again.
“It was a difficult time and we never left our homes at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the border with Gaza to express his support.
Before the ceasefire ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad stayed outside or fled their homes, moving to safer areas further from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine fragment, questioned whether they should go back.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families have still not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools during this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza that was severely damaged by Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study diligently and said: &quot;We will do our best to educate you and ensure your safety.&quot;
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately ended the hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas&#39;s demand to lift the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and to open airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, of whom three quarters were civilians, and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and UN estimates.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; notwithstanding this, he did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 missiles and mines at Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, has carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged and destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in more than 100 schools, which have been converted into shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and fighting continued, education officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a school in Gaza.
According to the popular criterion, property prices have shown the largest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic home value index for home prices in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
These gains resulted in a cumulative 4.2 percent increase in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than double the 12-month rise to August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that home prices in Sydney have risen 16.1 percent over the past year, while in Melbourne they have risen 11.7 percent.
The next most powerful markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five to six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which saw government spending cuts, where prices rose just 1.4 percent in a year.
Mr Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties for sale over the next few months, which will be a &quot;real test&quot; for the market.
“Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low interest rate environment, it is likely that home values will rise further over the next three months,” he said.
How people live in the oldest house in Ufa
In the former house of gold miners and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on 57/1 October Revolution Street (former Bolshaya Kazanskaya) there are 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century has remained practically unchanged since its construction, except for its dilapidation.
Strangers come here as if on an excursion, and the residents suffer more than they rejoice from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufa house, the walls of which remember the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is nearly 300 years old.
The old courtyard, the always open door, the creaky staircase.
The doors to the apartments are located close to each other, the walls are cracked, and in places the street is visible through the gaps from the peeling plaster.
Everything seems to be held on parole.
And the locals assure: &quot;You don&#39;t think this is the case.&quot;
It is very difficult to live in a wooden house of the 18th century, - says Tatyana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment number 3.
The object is under state protection, but no money has been allocated for its maintenance for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have simply forgotten about.
The last renovation was 40 years ago.
The walls are still holding up at the very least, but the foundation is all rotten.
Many residents still use the toilet outside and wash themselves once a week in a public bath.
How can you be satisfied in such conditions ?!
The road goes right under the windows, there is not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana pulls back the curtain.
Now you can see what was only heard before: a stream of cars rushing under the windows.
You see, the glass rattles all the time, we can&#39;t open the windows, but we&#39;re used to the noise.
Man gets used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are golden.
Moreover, we have two rooms, we live together with our son.
And for other families, conditions are much worse, on the second floor, in general, the ceilings are slightly more than one and a half meters high.
For contrast, Tatiana suggests visiting her neighbor from apartment No. 6, Lyudmila Starostina.
A pleasant hospitable woman from the doorway offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m² for four people, and this is how we live: my husband and I, daughter and granddaughter.
I&#39;ve been here since I was born, there has never been another living space, - Lyudmila looks around the room: mezzanine, two sofas with the letter &quot;g&quot;; on one of them is a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very closely and not much different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, &quot;historical&quot;.
But it flows regularly from the ceiling: the plumbing system is no good.
Lyudmila speaks of her apartment in an ordinary and surprising way at the same time, like an Italian woman whose house stands on Roman ruins.
That is, it brings together the very old and the recent, the everyday and the legendary:
The plumbing was installed about 40 years ago during the last renovation.
Then they made us a small kitchen in a cubbyhole and a toilet from a former closet.
We live exactly where Demidov and his family lived, servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
The Ufa Real Estate Center says that privatization does not matter.
All the same, we will get only a one-room apartment, we cannot pretend for more.
Already four months ago they promised to resettle us, but things did not go further than promises.
I&#39;m not used to complaining and I won&#39;t.
A whole dynasty lived in this apartment (room!): My grandmother and grandfather, mom and dad, me and my husband, and my daughter and granddaughter.
Anything has happened during this time.
For example, hefty rats were running around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the wing, they are one meter thick!
They say the solution was mixed in the eggs, which is why it lasts so long.
The house was built thoroughly, thanks to the Demidovs!
Probably, this is the only reason so far no one has been killed by the collapsed ceiling or pile.
Only the building is still slowly dying before our eyes: the boards and logs of the house are rotting, the floors have repeatedly collapsed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground, like into a well.
They say that it is - under our room there is a secret manhole and a passage to the Belaya River, which was specially made by the Old Believers who once lived here, so that they could hide from danger, if something happened.
They were also pursued.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them, begged to be allowed to start excavations in the apartment.
And then he tried to persuade them to give them living space in exchange for his one-room apartment on Oktyabrya Avenue.
Lyudmila refused to the historian:
Where are we four in odnushka?
And here there is even a tiny hope that they will give more spacious housing.
If we had agreed to the exchange, we would have won nothing.
However, the Starostin family won nothing.
Lyudmila&#39;s biggest dream is to be resettled, and her daughter and her 16-year-old granddaughter were given a separate room.
That is, a two-room apartment was allocated for two families instead of not the most majestic ruins in which two generations live now.
A pretty, petite girl Olesya Karsakova from apartments 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two cramped rooms with a total area of 23 m², called apartments, her large family lives.
There are seven of us, two children.
You can see for yourself what the conditions are.
Plaster falls off in pieces, like window frames, through holes in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms.
The tap water is only cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest building in Ufa, one can be convinced that the Lavrentievs from apartment No. 4 were the luckiest of all.
They occupy the largest rooms on the ground floor.
You are right, there is a lot of space!
The room is 75 squares, three people are registered.
We live in just those rooms where, according to legend, Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family, Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.
The ceilings are high and spacious.
One thing is bad - everything around is bursting at the seams, falling apart, falling apart.
The neighbors have probably already told!
Most of all we suffer with the floors: the wooden boards have rotted, the earth literally disappeared from under our feet.
I put up supports, wedges; in the hall there is still nothing, but in the other room we walk like we swing on a swing, everything is so shaky.
Alexander Dmitrievich can tell about the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov better than any guide.
He treats the gold miner as if he were his own, and speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was outstanding: the owner of the Kaginsky and Uzyansky factories built houses, cast cannons and bells, kept the Ural mines.
The heirs of merchant real estate are proud of their ancestor, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the XX century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden chambers for carriages, stables and guardhouses around, which were later demolished.
In 1968 they wanted to clean our house too, but something got in the way ...
History repeated itself in 2014: again beckoned to new housing.
We, as if on command, collected all the documents, ran around the necessary authorities, and suddenly found out that the move to apartments was postponed to 2015 or 2016.
Something we don&#39;t believe in all this anymore ...
Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The officials did not accept the tenant.
They were sent from one table to another, and then, as in a mockery, they gave out a piece of paper without a signature and seal: &quot;The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of tenants.&quot;
I even got the feeling that our house has long been gone in the city plan, because at first it was number 57, then it became 57 A, and now it is 57/1.
As if it had already been demolished in the 70s.
&quot;Russian Planet&quot; appealed to the head of the sector of information and analytical work of the land resources department of Ufa, Vladimir Barabash.
The house on 57/1 October Revolution Street is included in the program for the resettlement of dilapidated housing.
I cannot be responsible for the actions of the officials of the 70s, only I know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities to restore all the old buildings on October Revolution Street, which are of architectural value, is being successfully implemented.
Residents will soon be resettled in new apartments.
According to Barabash, the Demidov House will be restored by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
An architectural biennale is currently taking place in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there, among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire former Old Kazanskaya Street will be restored, the official says.
The houses will get the proper look, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
The Demidov House is likely to become a museum open to everyone.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street a pedestrian street on weekends.
On weekdays, unfortunately, it will not work, there is too much traffic in the city.
Vladimir Barabash promises to resettle people from the future museum in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from a different era.
A forest fire started in Primorye due to a thunderstorm
A dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire on the territory of the Okhotnichy district forestry in the Pozharsky district of the Primorsky Territory.
At the site of the fire, a build-up of the grouping of forces and means is underway.
According to the leadership of the Primorskaya Air Base KGSBU, the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, deputy head of the air base:
The fire that broke out in a hard-to-reach area was discovered by an observer pilot from an An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
Wood remains are burning on an old burner.
Strong littering of the territory and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the absence of suitable paratroopers-firefighters for landing create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
A Mi-8 helicopter is required.
The delivery of forces available to the airbase by Mi-2 helicopter and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was detected, 4 paratroopers-firefighters were promptly landed at the place of extinguishing.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional forces and fire extinguishing equipment.
In the area of lunch, 3 paratroopers-firefighters were additionally delivered by helicopter to the area of the village Okhotnichy.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the area of the fire is ready, specialists will be deployed to the place of extinguishing, according to the website of the Primorsky Territory administration.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
Never said &quot;I love you&quot;
Henry was one of seven children born to Jamaican immigrants at Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy&#39;s Rare Records, which is based in part on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the melodies are cheerful.
However, Henry had to wade through some difficult childhood memories.
After the death of his mother, there was &quot;a lot&quot; of treatment, in addition, Henry often reflects on the relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You have never seen his face, you only heard his voice: “Stop making noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, used to go to the pub with him and talk about things like the shape of the beer glass, the beauty of hitting in cricket.
I never spoke to him like that.
He was that unsmiling guy in the corner who had been reading the newspaper for most of my life.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley and while conditions are better than in his father&#39;s days, he was able to get a glimpse of what his life must have been like.
Now it is a little better, but it is dark, smoky, depths of the labyrinths of the underworld with flashes of fire and smoke and a pile of soot.
My dad would get into the bathtub and just lay there, and you heard him slowly begin to sing to himself, because he wanted to clean up the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing this for years and years to earn our livelihood, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry emerged from childhood deprived of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, &quot;I love you.&quot;
Only when my mother felt bad at the very end of her life, we began to say: “I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love that he lacked as a child.
Can you stop this &quot;I love you&quot;?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I&#39;m 22!
With Don French.
Why shouldn&#39;t I be friends with her?
She is a great mom
They are still great friends with French, whom he has been married to for 25 years.
Don is a good person.
Why don&#39;t I be friends with Don?
She&#39;s a great mom.
Henry&#39;s own mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very well and had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, “You need to take drastic measures.
Then I started serious fitness training, and I also had to go on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It&#39;s very hard.
And it&#39;s boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
Henry&#39;s change in career path is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-cropped beard.
Ever since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has completely immersed himself in the theater.
The Comedy of Errors followed, followed by August Wilson&#39;s Fences.
This work is different from the sitcoms and comedies that have been an integral part of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ noticed him parodying on stage and wrote about him in New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-seventies: &quot;For quite a long time, I was the only black parodist / comedian on television.&quot;
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn how to be an efficient joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working in television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager had the rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people “blackened their faces,” Henry found himself performing on it for five years.
My family really didn&#39;t like it.
I kind of want this to never happen to me, but I don&#39;t regret doing it.
Although this was a strange, reprehensible position, I worked in large venues and learned to work with the crowd.
But what had been &quot;award-winning light entertainment classics on British television for years and years&quot; was also &quot;a grotesque parody of black people.&quot;
Introducing characters who both mocked and celebrated black culture in the UK, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the eighties.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, Chef Gareth Blacklock from the sitcom Chef!
Commercials, documentaries, television series and movie roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, &quot;What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little that you are wasting time or slowly turning aside. &quot;
Then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 titled &quot;What&#39;s Good About ...?&quot;
The first was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
This is not to say that I was really taught this in school, and I thought that it was, in many ways, the prerogative of white people of the middle class with tights and cabbage at the bottom of the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, “You have to try.
Don&#39;t scold it until you know what you&#39;re talking about.
Say some of these words out loud and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello&#39;s last monologue for the documentary and he was hooked.
I got the feeling that I can do it.
As if my head had been straightened.
“This is what it is, this is a serious matter, take it seriously, teach your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this piece for months and months before we put it on.
And she was successful.
It seemed that they were expecting a disaster, but it did not happen.
Soon we started The Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I&#39;m at the National Theater and I just couldn&#39;t believe it to the end.
There was one moment when I thought, &quot;Oh, you&#39;ve changed.&quot;
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his business was to entertain the audience.
&quot;A quiet voice inside me said,&quot; You have to work 10 minutes while they fix the computer. &quot;
Instead, the assistant director announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said: &quot;Oh, thank God.&quot;
This is not my responsibility.
I can let someone else figure this out.
&quot;You are in the play, stay in the role.&quot;
Henry at the Fences at the Duchess Theater
Learning the text for &quot;Fences&quot; was difficult.
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
She was also well received, so it was like a sign from above, showing: &quot;This is what you need to do.&quot;
He says it, of course, in a LOUD voice.
So I stick with it.
I really love this.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the thinking of a comedian - all the way our conversation is interrupted by outbursts of his humor, when he starts and stops parodying.
I just decided not to work in stand-up because this thing with an instant reward from a full room of strangers I think is pretty dangerous.
If you strive for this all the time, it can lead to a dead end.
I do Apollo Live sometimes when I want to, but mostly I don&#39;t enjoy the fun I used to.
I ask if he will give a stand-up tour someday.
The joy of being in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the journey - I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever want to give up on that.
That is, this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I love being an actor.
It&#39;s fun.
You always tell a story, and this is a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify &quot;invisible workers&quot;
Kenya has started biometric registration of all civil servants in an attempt to remove &quot;invisible workers&quot; from the government&#39;s payroll.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, according to a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving government service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has pledged to cut government corruption after taking office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $ 1 million (£ 700,000) a month was wasted in payments to stealth workers and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects that salaries continue to flow into bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves government service, according to BBC reporter Wanyama Chebushiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All government officials must report to identification centers within the next two weeks to ensure that their data is collected through a biometric registration procedure, according to a government statement.
Anyone who does not do so without good reason will be struck off the payroll, it says.
“This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the civil service by defining the actual number of civil servants, and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of government - therefore, it will end the problem of invisible workers,” said Ann Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary for Planning and the structuring of power.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with &quot;conspiracy&quot; against government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of &quot;conspiracy against the government,&quot; according to local news agencies.
Police representatives did not immediately comment on this information.
Among those detained were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them participated in a corruption detection exercise last December that sought to screen government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) identified their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1) after summer break.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting reporters that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do his best to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1st, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
All of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian popular front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, where Yatsenyuk&#39;s daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future life.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children putting on embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the kind of executive it needs
She is followed by a trail of fame from the world of banking, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
Indeed, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at global management consulting firm Bain and Co and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world at Pearsons.
She was the chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years, after retiring when a male colleague in a lower position took over a senior position at Pearson&#39;s parent company.
Her earnings are said to be close to £ 1 million.
Its political rating is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory advisor.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman&#39;s job the poisoned bowl.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of public life, but there is an inherent paradox in its structure.
The council has two directions: inward as the top level of the BBC&#39;s own management hierarchy, but also outward as the voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly that needs a complete radical reform.
However, which new chairman would risk coming in, trampling and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he loses his job in the process.
This is a difficult decision.
It wouldn&#39;t be that difficult, many people will be happy to see the BBC shrink in size - after revising its mandate, finances and status.
As competitors shrink and new technologies challenge old cozy habits, the inevitable license price negotiations pose a particular threat to the BBC.
For a modest sum of £ 145.50 a year, the British acquire a stake in what is arguably the greatest media venture in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its output reaches 96 percent of households and costs each one just 40p a day.
Moreover, it is clear that the popularity of Beeb is growing: 53 percent support it today versus 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC viewing and usage patterns have changed: I now receive news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and imposing institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope it found him.
Perry from Texas says the derogatory tweet was written by someone outside
A tweet from the verified account of Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry on Sunday night contained an offensive portrayal of the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of prosecutions on abuse of power charges.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry&#39;s account, in which the post was disavowed.
I just posted a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
&quot;I disapprove of this tweet and I removed it,&quot; a later post reported.
Perry&#39;s aides did not immediately respond to messages asking for comment.
Although the tapes were downloaded from Perry&#39;s verified account, it was unclear who was actually posting to this feed.
An earlier tweet contained an unflattering cartoon of Travis County Attorney Rosemary Lemberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry imposed a funding ban on her department when she refused to step down, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The caption in the tweet reads: &quot;I don&#39;t always drive under 3x the blood alcohol level ... but when I do, I indict Governor Perry for telling me this.&quot;
I&#39;m the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg did not conduct a grand jury investigation against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special attorney from San Antonio who was appointed as a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the indictment, saying the law that is used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is vague, contrary to the constitution.
Perry cut off $ 7.5 million in state funding to the Travis County Department of Public Oversight, which is working to prosecute Texas public sector corruption when Lemberg refused to step down.
The veto prompted a formal complaint from a left-wing public oversight group.
Perry&#39;s verified account feed is updated frequently - and sometimes famous.
Coming fifth at the party convention in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he might quit the game by tweeting a photo of himself running near the lake and saying, “Here we are, South Caroline!&quot;
Berkeley Says Real Estate Market Is Back To &quot;Normal&quot;
One of London&#39;s most prominent property developers has warned that the real estate market in South East England has &quot;returned&quot; to normal activity.
Homes in the capital have been the subject of buoyant demand and skyrocketing prices, with widespread fears that a credit bubble will push the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgeley, founder and chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said Monday: &quot;Since the beginning of this fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its peak in 2013,&quot; adding that this provided a &quot;stable work environment.&quot;
The London property market thrived during the downturn as foreign buyers flocked to the capital.
Prices in the city have jumped 18.5 percent in the past year alone, according to the Land Registry, well ahead of the 6.7 percent average for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for Berkeley&#39;s private, affordable and student schemes rose about one-fifth last year, reaching £ 423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also been stopped by new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential &quot;mansion tax&quot; ahead of next May&#39;s general election.
London-based real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced tighter loan terms, would also lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a fall in mortgage approvals in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, cut its forecast for London property prices for 2015 to 3 percent on the basis that property price sentiment has already begun to wane.
Transaction volumes, meanwhile, fell by a quarter from the previous year in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
Nonetheless, demand for homes in the capital proved to be very beneficial for Berkeley, driving sales in excess of £ 2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgeley added: &quot;The demand for the right product with a good design and a better location has remained the same and, reflecting this, the term sales have continued.&quot;
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes this year by the end of April - nearly a third more than the 2007 pre-crisis peak.
Annual pre-tax profit climbed 40 percent year-over-year to £ 380 million, and revenue climbed 18 percent to £ 1.6 billion.
Speaking Monday before the company&#39;s annual meeting, Pidgeley said Berkeley&#39;s projected earnings for this year will be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts are unanimous in expecting a full-year pre-tax profit of £ 450m.
Berkeley&#39;s share price traded at £ 23.96 on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
Jennifer Lawrence nude photos posted online by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th Annual Academy Awards.
Photos of nude actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won the &quot;Oscar&quot;, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a &quot;catalog&quot; of photos of another 100 rising stars.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games star confirmed that Lawrence&#39;s photographs were real and denounced the hacker for &quot;blatant invasion of privacy.&quot;
Law enforcement has been contacted and will pursue anyone who posts the stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly derived from Apple&#39;s lack of iCloud online storage, and the alleged &quot;directory&quot; of hack victims includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is unclear how many of these photos are genuine, although &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. All&quot; star Winstead also denounced the hack on Twitter.
&quot;To those looking at the pictures that my husband and I took a few years ago, secluded at home, I hope you are proud of yourself,&quot; Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon&#39;s &quot;iCarly&quot; and &quot;Victorious&quot; denied that she was in the photos, tweeting: “These so-called nude photos of me are FALSE, folks.
Let me nip it off. * pun intended *.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied the alleged photos of her were genuine.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson&#39;s new critically acclaimed love and J novel
They dissolved, best of all, they fell apart, like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only sometimes did the woman tell him that he was too serious, difficult to communicate, tense, closed and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw himself as irritable.
He was as prickly as a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this thorniness was a little romance, from which he expected more than usual, deliverance from a lonely and boring life and, perhaps, even some kind of satisfaction.
Eilynn Solomons was a quiveringly fragile beauty with tousled hair and a fluttering heart from a northern island village even more remote and harsh than Port Royben.
She came south with an older companion, whom Kevern believed to be her aunt, while the latter inherited a house in a damp but paradise-like valley, joyfully called Paradise Valley.
Nobody has lived in the house for several years.
The pipes flowed, spiders sat motionless in the bathtubs, slugs left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden is overgrown with weeds that look like giant cabbages.
It was like a cottage from a children&#39;s book, frightening and bewitching at the same time, with a garden full of secrets.
From the author&#39;s perspective: Howard Jacobson, whose novel &quot;J&quot; was longlisted for the 2014 Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week
Kevern and Eilenn sat hand in hand in broken sun loungers among the tall grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; they both absentmindedly plugged into a cheap console that was supplying the country with soothing music and soothing news when, looking down at her crossed brown legs, he remembered an old song by a long-forgotten black artist that his father loved to listen to when the curtains were drawn down in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
They weren&#39;t banned - nothing was actually banned - they just weren&#39;t lost anymore.
They were helped to become as archaic as the word &quot;archaic&quot; itself.
Public taste did what orders and prescriptions could never achieve, and just as among books people chose memoirs of the rich who grew up in poverty, cookbooks and romance novels, they chose ballads from all music.
Carried away by the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and singing Eilynn&#39;s big legs in a rough, comic voice.
Eilynn didn&#39;t get it.
“It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller,” he told her, mechanically placing two fingers to his lips.
This is what his father always did to stop the letter &quot;J&quot; before it left his lips.
It started with a game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start a word with &quot;J&quot;, forgetting to put two fingers to your mouth - and it will cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game then, and it wasn’t very fun now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that&#39;s all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Eilinn had never heard him.
Jazz was not played either, although it was not openly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one &quot;if&quot; left in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It&#39;s the same with wit.
Its unpredictability got on people&#39;s nerves.
And jazz was wit expressed through music.
Although he had reached the age of 10, having never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father&#39;s semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn&#39;t have to tell Eilynn that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
Society was obedient, which meant that every segment of it agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those saved by fate - with the principle of group disposition.
Afro-Caribbean people were well-suited for entertainment and sports in temperament and physical characteristics - and they sang and ran.
Immigrants from Hindustan, as if by nature talented in everything related to electronics, took it upon themselves to ensure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What remained of the Polish diaspora was plumbing; what was left of the Greek beat the cymbals.
People from the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country when WHAT HAPPENED, IF HAPPENED AT ALL, in fear that they would be accused of kindling the flame, in fear, in fact, that the flame would consume them next, opened restaurants with labne and hookahs, did not protrude and yearned for idleness.
To each according to his ability.
Since she had only heard ballads before, it was difficult for Eilenn to understand how the offensive words Kevern had just sang to her could even be set to music.
Music is an expression of love.
&quot;They&#39;re not really offensive,&quot; Kevern said.
Perhaps, perhaps, for people who have big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of safety.
No word could penetrate the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-like leaves.
Eilenn still didn&#39;t understand.
How could your father love such a thing?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn&#39;t want to press two fingers to his lips again in front of her.
She already thought him strange.
“It sounded funny to him,” he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief, blocking Kevern&#39;s line of sight.
In the whole world there was nothing but a shock of her jet-black hair.
Nothing he wants to look at.
&quot;Well, if you say so,&quot; she said, remaining unconvinced.
But that still doesn&#39;t explain why you are singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Are my legs too big?
He looked at them again.
This is not to say no.
Ankles, maybe a little ...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Hate you?
Of course, I don’t hate you.
It&#39;s just this stupid song.
He could say, &quot;I love you,&quot; but it was too early for that.
“I like you precisely because you have thick ankles,” he tried to say instead.
I have such a perversion.
It didn&#39;t sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often put him in awkward situations, because, like his father, he lacked that soothing charm that could soften the cruelty hidden in the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to.
Despite the kind eyes.
Eilynn Solomons blushed and got up from the deck chair, knocking over the console and spilling the wine they were drinking.
Elderberry wine, so drunkenness could not be used as an excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
&quot;And I like you precisely because you have a dull head,&quot; she said ...
Although you don&#39;t like it.
He felt sorry for her and because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her gaze when she rebuffed him.
Did she think he was going to hit her?
She had not spoken to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that she was fundamentally similar to the one here.
The same huge icy ocean hit both of them.
The same bewildered men, even more sensitive and capricious after WHAT HAPPENED, IF AT ALL HAPPENED than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered in a rage from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand against any woman who dared to refuse them or tease them.
Dull head?
They would have shown her a dull fist if she hadn&#39;t been careful!
First they would have kissed - kissing has now become the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the insipid ballads that the console gave out was to kiss her first, then hit her.
An unnecessary clarification, according to Kevern, because the kiss itself was already hooliganism.
Eilynn Solomons indicated with her corps that he needed to leave.
He rose from the deck chair like an old man.
She herself felt a leaden weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the upper window watched him leave, her companion - a man who himself took on the burdens.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a prick of compassion for him and men in general, even though some of them raised their hand to her.
A man who turned away from her, with his back bent, ashamed, overwhelmed, all ability to fight left him - why did she think she knew this so well, if she could not remember a single case, until today, when she would have seen this ?
Alone again, Eilynn Solomons looked down at her feet.
Twenty years or so before the events described above, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked for Ofnau, an unofficial Public Mood Control Service, prepared a short report on the persistence of low to moderate levels of violence in those very parts of the country. where it was expected to decrease, if not stop altogether, given the means and forces that were allocated to eradicate it.
“Much has been done, and much is being done,” she wrote, “to mitigate the inherent aggressiveness of the people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these tangled branches and narrow clefts of the country, where, despite the spiers of churches hovering over the hedges, , the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
However, some qualities turn out to be ineradicable.
The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower are the passions that it generates.
The populace sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories of overcoming obstacles and proclaims their fervent faith in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the old rudeness retain its strong grip in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there is also evidence of that new and vicious bullying is emerging in homes, workplaces, roads, and even playgrounds.
“You have the annoying habit of writing too much,” her supervisor said after reading the entire talk.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I must also ask you: Are you an atheist?
“I don&#39;t think I have to answer,” Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
“I&#39;m asking,” Luther Rabinowitz finally said, “not because I&#39;m against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We have no prejudices here.
We are servants of a society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, perfectly acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as the ones you showed me.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;rude&quot; others would interpret as an expression of natural love of life and energy.
To keep pining about WHAT HAPPENED WHEN HAPPENED AT ALL, as if it happened, if at all, yesterday, is to deprive the country of the vitality it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, flamingo-pink LED letters echoed the advice Ofnau had been giving the country for the past quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
A conversation is better than silence, the word of a song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
“I totally understand what you are trying to say,” Esme Nussbaum replied quietly when she made sure her supervisor finished speaking, “and I don’t want to say anything other than that we haven’t healed as effectively as we can tell ourselves.
My concern is that if we are not ready, we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that initially led to WHAT HAPPENED IF AT ALL HAPPENED.
Only this time, we will not throw our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz connected his fingertips into a pyramid.
This gesture was meant to mean endless patience.
“You are going too far,” he said, “calling mistakes” the actions that our grandfathers did or didn’t do.
You are going too far when you talk about how they threw out their &quot;anger&quot; and &quot;mistrust&quot; on &quot;others.&quot;
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that, understanding the past, that is, defending the present, we are not talking about &quot;us&quot; and about &quot;them.&quot;
There were no &quot;us&quot; and there were no &quot;others.&quot;
It was a time of turmoil - that&#39;s all we know.
“For which, to be honest with ourselves,” Esme dared to insert, “no part of society can justify itself well.
I don&#39;t blame anyone.
Whether it was good or bad, what&#39;s done is done.
Then it was then.
Nothing more needs to be said - here we agree.
And just as there is no need to blame anyone, there is no need to make excuses if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not in order to learn -
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one word to this -
Luther Rabinowitz&#39;s pyramid collapsed.
“I will review your report,” he said, letting go of her.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove onto the sidewalk, as passers-by described it, &quot;in a vicious rage.&quot;
Coincidences happen.
The Lesotho Army says the coup was not planned; the prime minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho army officials denied plotting a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were acting against police, which they suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane fled the country, claiming that the country&#39;s army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, claiming that he had received an assassination threat.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was not actually a coup, but that the army was responding to a threat from &quot;political fanatics&quot; the police were trying to arm.
&quot;What happened this morning is that the command of the Armed Forces of Lesotho took action, having received several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to wreak havoc &quot;he told the Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Moniela said the army&#39;s actions looked like a coup.
“While no one has claimed to seize power by force, by all accounts, the actions of the Lesotho Armed Forces at this point have major signs of a coup,” he said.
Lesotho&#39;s army officials said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motejoa Metsing runs the government in Tabane&#39;s absence.
Tabane said he believed he was being attacked for trying to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of divisions in his united government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will be on loan with Milan this coming season, according to the Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the next few hours for a medical examination.
In the past season, he entered the field with the London club only three times.
Let&#39;s remind that earlier “Milan” rented striker Fernando Torres from “Liverpool”.
Eurozone production at its lowest in 13 months
Eurozone production growth slowed to its lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest Eurozone manufacturing PMI fell to 50.7 in August from 51.8 in July.
A reading above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed and businesses suffered amid growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures came ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will await a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with the halt in the eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation at only 0.3% inflation.
There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi may give additional signals later this week that he is contemplating a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
&quot;While any growth is better than no growth at all, the inhibitory effects of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers are becoming more evident,&quot; said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
Manufacturing PMI in Germany, Russia&#39;s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its 11-month low of 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the block&#39;s second largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be of real concern, as does Italy&#39;s weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
Signs that the growth momentum has faded in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, is also not adding confidence, ”said Mr Dobson.
The slowdown in industry is likely to further fuel the fire for analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news came from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: &quot;The best that can be said about the August survey of the Eurozone Manufacturing PMI is that it shows that the sector is still growing.&quot;
He added: “Eurozone producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - especially those related to Russia / Ukraine - add uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This heightened tensions have obviously hit business - and especially consumer confidence - and is likely causing some orders to be delayed or even canceled, especially large orders.
He said it &quot;looks more and more like&quot; that the ECB will eventually have to implement some kind of quantitative easing, &quot;although we suspect it will be limited.&quot;
Residents of Mariupol will put up a human chain against the militias
Everything was calm in Mariupol until last week - no one was eager to organize the Mariupol People&#39;s Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now residents are awaiting the arrival of the &quot;militias&quot; with horror.
According to political scientists, the separatists are breaking through to Mariupol in order to reach the Sea of Azov - the city of Novoazovsk was recently taken, which had also not been part of the self-proclaimed republics before.
The residents of Mariupol decided that the Ukrainian army, although it would defend them, had little forces against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and gathered to help the military.
They dig trenches, build checkpoints and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand residents arrived at the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a human chain, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in the event of an offensive.
Volunteers collect and transport equipment and food, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
Shops are gradually closing in the city, banks and ATMs are shutting down.
Ten Years of Hell for Beslan Survivors: Ten Years Since the Terrible Takeover of the School, How Children Who Trapped in It Still Suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day ordeal that shook the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during the school atrocity.
Exactly ten years after the horrific seizure of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors of the catastrophe warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed like something of an extreme degree of possible evil.
The tragedy united East and West in disgust, which, in a surprising way, then grew into action and hope for the future in the midst of severe grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death during the school atrocities.
We found amazing young people who stood up to adversity, although the memories of terrorist hell will live on with them forever.
Their biggest hope?
That the war that is now tormenting Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now end.
The girl in the photo trying to climb back into the bombarded gym
She was captured in the photo of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when she was trying to get back into the fired gymnasium after a mine explosion in only her underwear.
In confusion, Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larisa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them died, but in fact, they survived.
&quot;The woman told me to run with all her might, but I could not,&quot; Aida said then.
My feet were covered in blood.
I got up and crawled back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and carried her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was fully recovered, but yesterday said: “Three months ago the pain came back.
I&#39;m afraid I may need more operations.
Several pieces of shrapnel remained in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people in the same way that doctors helped her.
&quot;This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn&#39;t break it,&quot; she says defiantly.
“It happened to me, and this fact cannot be changed.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too much.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed that we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I&#39;ll think about my family later.
She says the grip stays with her, although the memories fade a little each year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our troubles and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see a photo on the Internet where I climb through the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make it so that this does not happen again.
The boy who ran through a hail of bullets, believing that his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (Russians start school at age 7) and survived three days of capture while hugging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said: &quot;Mom told me to lie down if there is an explosion, and hold her hand.&quot;
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She told him, &quot;Run.&quot;
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and on the way saw a crying baby, grabbed the baby by the hand and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said: “Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, &quot;I couldn&#39;t save her.&quot;
In fact, Tamara got out and was in the hospital with injuries to her legs, in turn thinking that her son was dead.
After their reunion, she said, “I cried with joy.
I couldn&#39;t believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (the now defunct News of the World), where he was awarded as Barnardo&#39;s Child Advocate by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
“This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it,” he said yesterday.
Still, I can say that it fades in my memory.
I remember right after that I threw away all my toy weapons.
But now I can play computer shooting games and this is not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember those children with whom I played in the yard, who never got out.
We never say that they are killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted and the ride in an open top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the kind of grief that he and his friends have endured.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
“I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,” said Damir, who volunteered for the convent last week.
I really want to help.
I want to serve in the police sometime and hope to be enrolled in the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: “37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the eerie silence immediately after the capture, there were simply no children screaming and running around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I would like to call Sheri and just tell her herself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shot them with his water pistol, and they ran away and played with him.
And only a month has passed since our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: “I still think this world hasn&#39;t gotten better in these 10 years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They are just the same children as ours.
I think for many people, war is a news report that they listen to when they are bored or when they are busy doing something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can&#39;t stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and this is so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very gentle and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive and not angry.
He is not looking for revenge, for example, he is not fixated on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn&#39;t like to remember him, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from this - I remember how he lay on the couch, turning away from us, for hours.
Didn&#39;t sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, he is taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for several hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got to my feet, I looked around, I saw hell around me, with body parts lying everywhere.
I was absolutely convinced that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
&quot;I remember that I shouted to him:&quot; Damir, run, run away &quot;, but again I was so sure that he did not hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
This is how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgy Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose shocking post-capture photograph was decisive for the Beslan tragedy
Peace: Beslan survivor Georgy Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and Georgy on the right today
His bloody face bore an imprint of fear as he fled from death, when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the head physician, took him to school on his first day of school before taking his eldest son Vladimir to the university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare,” she recalled.
Not quite alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the more difficult it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
It does not seem to us that it was long ago, I think that it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days are always in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Suits: George&#39;s photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and has been immortalized in sculpture (right)
I remember that George was so eager to go to school that day that he said that he wanted to hug the teacher.
I only found out that he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of the weeping George in San Marino.
George doesn&#39;t like to look at this photo, and it is hidden in a bookcase in our house.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this photograph, people from all over the world feel our pain.
George says now: “It is important that this never happens again.
&quot;I doubt we&#39;ll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
They are now investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is heading for something very bad.
“I cannot understand how this happens, because if you ask people, no one wants war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need decades to pass to forget her a little.
It affected my health and I can still feel it.
For about three or four years I had nightmares about being captured, but now it&#39;s better.
I returned to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That&#39;s why I keep going to this gym every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It&#39;s hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to do it.
I don&#39;t feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I will not forget this, but I do not feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from high school this year and entered the Medical University in Vladikavkaz.
I will be studying to become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be in the military, but my health did not allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won&#39;t happen.
Georgy Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived despite being at the feet of a terrorist killer
Incredible: Georgy Farniev was at the feet of the terrorist killer during the capture, but still managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in the gymnasium sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a terrorist killer.
Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.
“It seems to us that it was only yesterday,” says Georgy, who wanted to study as an intelligence officer in the FSB but was unable to because of the damage to his health during the capture.
It is still with me, it is not something that I left behind.
I am older now and they say that children easily deal with bad events - I have to say that this is not true.
“In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can&#39;t forget it.
I would like to forget.
2005 - the next year - was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I fainted.
I would never go there again, and please don&#39;t ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous photograph.
Survivor: Georgy Farniev today with a photo of himself opened on a laptop in the hospital after the capture
My pain is immense and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don&#39;t like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for the physical condition, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with my knee, which was damaged, but now I can walk normally.
Still, my health did not allow me to go to study at the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second hobby was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals &quot;from cats to cows&quot;.
He said, “I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not something that children should be aware of, and certainly not something that they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
She&#39;s in my soul, worse when the anniversary draws near.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate her.
I know that Georgy will not go.
It should be even stronger for him, because he was there and I was not.
I was waiting for him at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan everyone has an imprint.
He stays with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It&#39;s hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He is a boy, he loves sports, but he cannot do it because of his knee.
He has had several operations, he can walk, but cannot play sports.
I would say that he overcame this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This eerie experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and this only adds to my pain.
I lost many people whom I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift that God could give me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who never married again.
It&#39;s hard to accept that life goes on even if you don&#39;t want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world - wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we are at war now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If only you could grab all the rebels and throw them - as far as possible.
Alena Tskayeva, 10 years old
A baby who was touchingly taken to safety by a special forces soldier
Rescued: Alyona Tskayeva is carried to safety by a Russian special forces soldier (left).
Now she is ten (on the right), and she does not remember at all about the monstrous crime
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when a Russian policeman carried little Alena out of a seized school in Beslan in his arms.
The terrorists let her go, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christina and brother Mahar in the school gym.
Makhar, who was then three years old, escaped, but Alena&#39;s mother and sister died in a mortal carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since married again, and he and his new wife Svetlana have a little daughter, whom he named Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alena, who is now ten, does not remember anything about the capture and has blossomed into an intelligent and cheerful girl, neighbors say.
&quot;They are a big happy family now, and Alyona and Makhar are both wonderful children,&quot; says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories as their tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can see why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who has returned from Manchester United to Borussia Dortmund, said he is looking forward to returning to the field in the form of the German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyous event in his career.
Of course, I am very glad that I will play for Borussia again, - quotes Bild as saying Kagawa.
I feel very good.
I am full of positive emotions and I look forward to being able to enter the field again in the form of Borussia.
Recall that Kagawa moved to Manchester United from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to gain a foothold in the English club, having spent only 38 matches in the English championship in two seasons, scoring 6 goals and giving 8 assists.
Man accused of hitting a girl at the Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man faces trial on charges of hitting a three-year-old girl at the Pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl at the Pittenwyn crossing in East Newquay.
Prosecutors said that Mr. Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 without proper care and attention and hit the girl, as a result of which she was injured.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruter, has denied guilt in Dundee Sheriff&#39;s Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, QC, has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not shop in Vladivostok
The Vladivostok Airport Duty Free shop has displayed a sign prohibiting a number of world political leaders from shopping in this shop.
Do not buy them perfume, vodka and cognac.
The store administration decided that US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Vitali Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Japanese Prime Minister and several other famous comrades will not be able to stock up on vodka, cognac and perfume in their store.
And posted a sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama received a ban on the appearance in an institution even less accessible to him by the nature of the service - the Diet canteens of Moscow State University, as reported by the website of catering establishments.
It is not known whether the American president ever cherished the dream of eating in a dietetic canteen in Russia, but the authors of the bans clearly seem terribly witty to themselves.
Is there any cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies in order to establish the production of cheeses that are in demand among buyers.
The advice was given during a visit to the Yugptitseprom enterprise of the Agrocomplex company.
The head of government also gave advice to restaurateurs to reorient themselves to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the proper level.
The annual food import embargo was introduced in Russia on August 7.
The head coach of the Russian national team, Valentin Maslakov, is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result given the lack of purposeful preparation for the competition.
Our athletes performed at their level, - quotes &quot;All Sport&quot; the words of Maslakov.
The third place is a confirmation of our sufficiently high command level.
It&#39;s nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It should be borne in mind that we did not prepare for these competitions.
The season is over, and we have not obliged our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have become the second in this tournament, but this season our team has been updated.
The French, on the other hand, put up a battle-worthy team, including 13 European champions.
They made no secret of their intention to win this year, which they have publicly announced many times.
But even this composition of the hosts of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians performed in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some events were an order of magnitude lower than in the same &quot;Diamond League&quot;.
The season is over.
Naturally, the result is not so important for athletes, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, it reached the point of absurdity, when at 1500 meters men were so fond of the tactical intricacies of running that they showed a result below the average level ... for women&#39;s races.
4 tips to get the best quality underwater photos and videos
Whether you want to photograph or shoot underwater video, there are a number of equipment options available to you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof soap box like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which sell for around $ 300.
I took these pictures at a family party with several cameras, all for about $ 350.
No matter what equipment you use, there are a few rules to follow in order to get the best results.
Double-check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, customize your camera for the type of photos or videos you will be taking.
Some cameras and camcorders have shooting or subject type modes that optimize exposure for dark underwater conditions.
And before jumping into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our buying guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots - because many of them will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have LCDs to help you compose your shots, whereas action cameras usually don&#39;t.
Even if you have an LCD monitor, it will be difficult to see underwater and framing will be a random process.
So take a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a burst mode that takes multiple shots at slightly different exposure settings, use that.
Stay near the surface.
The amount of light is significantly reduced the deeper you dive into the water.
If possible, stay near the surface when shooting in a pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to convey more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Swim closer to your subjects.
This is great advice for shooting on land, but even more important underwater due to the darkened lighting conditions.
Especially important if you&#39;re shooting with an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you&#39;ll have to get close to your subjects if you want to fill the frame.
Bilyal Makhov, bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games in freestyle wrestling, can go to Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was announced by the head coach of the Dagestan national freestyle wrestling team Sazhid Sazhidov.
The specialist did not rule out the athlete&#39;s participation in the World Championships in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Bilyal Makhov is at the gathering of the &quot;classics&quot; team, &quot;R-Sport&quot; quotes Sazhid Sazhidov as saying.
In general, Bilyal performed in juniors in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he became the winner of the freestyle wrestling tournament and the third medalist in the Greco-Romans competition, and decided to concentrate on freestyle wrestling.
There has been talk for a long time that our heavyweight will play a new stage in his career in Greco-Roman wrestling.
I will say more: Makhov can perform at the World Championships in Tashkent - if he wins the estimate.
But the final word is always with the coaching staff headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of person whose strength of personality could shake everything around, even in such a giant organization as the National Health Service.
A consultant anesthesiologist, he has dedicated his career to ridding patients of both the suffering of illness and the pangs of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalls, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors were preoccupied with diagnoses and diseases, those undergoing treatment were mainly concerned about something completely different - pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
“I didn’t feel as usual,” he wrote last May.
It was difficult for me to find the strength in myself.
While battling flu-like symptoms, he found himself annoyed with his wife, Juliet.
&quot;I want things to happen faster, not later,&quot; he noted.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson found himself unusually and for some reason upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to take a chest x-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The x-ray results came in.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or the lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine the exact cause.
Although some smokers develop lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material once called &quot;miracles&quot; but now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos is, after all, a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when an advisory industrial ban took effect.
Even when it was in use, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipe insulators, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems to be a cause for concern today.
But such calmness is wrong.
The UK, it turns out, is today at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic.
More people die from mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die from the disease than from car accidents.
Annual number of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in the UK
The reason we feel its lethal effects now is that although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), mesothelioma usually takes decades to develop.
And the mesothelioma attack is not limited to veterans of industrial construction majors.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, embedded in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma is oblivious to class, wealth, profession, or age.
The bastions of exclusivity, from trendy London department stores to private schools, have proven to be no salvation.
The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.
Even hospitals that are designed to treat us have turned out to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a pipe insulator.
As a matter of fact, he had to think about where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he realized.
“It seems like there could be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy&#39;s hospital where I spent six years interning,” he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and loaders - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
This was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
&quot;Of the four doctors who trained at Guy&#39;s Hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma in the past five years,&quot; he noted in a letter in 2010, &quot;I am the only one left alive.&quot;
How many of us will get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
It is unusual to live for such a long time.
Fifty percent of people with mesothelioma die within 8 months of diagnosis.
She is always deadly.
Thus, now we can only repeat Lawson&#39;s question: &quot;How many of us will get the same disease?&quot;
According to leading expert on mesothelioma in the UK, Professor Julian Pitot, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the UK&#39;s asbestos epidemic is about to die out, about 90,000 people will die.
Most now do not imagine that they will die this way.

A quick look at courtroom reports, where victims often seek compensation, reveals how far the attack of mesothelioma has spread.
This June, for example, Marks &amp; Spencer admitted that they inadvertently exposed Janice Ellen to contact with asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, managing clothing departments at two locations, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&amp;S.
She now has two children over 20 years old.
“Before this happened,” she says, “I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
It never occurred to me that it would affect me.
Few people really know much about asbestos.
As a matter of fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They get their name from the word &quot;asbestos&quot;, which means a fibrous structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It has been used in roofing panels, floor tiles, pipe thermal insulation, boiler seams, even in car brake pads.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a &quot;serious source of health damage&quot; that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
The UK was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that &quot;there is strong, if indirect, evidence to suggest that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK].&quot;

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pitot&#39;s work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that &quot;a significant percentage of mesotheliomas, when there is no known exposure at work or home, were most likely caused by exposure to environmental asbestos.&quot;
Much of this impact, he says, is due to &quot;normal use and weather conditions&quot; on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure that he is safe.
A Goddard Consulting report that looked at Palace of Westminster demonstrates how people, even in the very heart of government, could be exposed unknowingly.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be propelled by something as harmless as &quot;strong air currents.&quot;
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case the opposite seems to be true.
Although the Parliamentary Maintenance Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster received a &quot;clean sanitation certificate&quot;, it has now admitted that £ 1bn worth of work is needed to renovate Parliament, improve the electrical system and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election MPs may sit in the nearby QE2 convention center rather than on the green benches of Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that &quot;the asbestos situation was not managed according to different regulations.&quot;
It is impossible to know if this management error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who have never been able to identify their exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital that was successfully sued for asbestos,” he says, “But I cannot prove it in my case.
It&#39;s so hard to remember all the places where I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009 when he was struck down by what looked like the flu.
He was 45 and in the middle of an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I started to feel feverish.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn&#39;t drive all the way home.
As a physician, Abbott knew that pain came from the pleura, the membrane around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
Ultimately, he couldn&#39;t go to work for a month.
Perplexed doctors took chest x-rays and inserted pleural catheters to draw fluid from the lungs and send it for testing.
Yet his condition remained without diagnosis.
Gradually his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after exercising and breathing heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott&#39;s patients came to his waiting room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott&#39;s condition worsened again, and his consulting physician showed his CT and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel unwell, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lung.
I&#39;m an optimist.
I usually just move on, &quot;he says.
I wasn&#39;t too worried about that, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Years: &quot;I was told it was mesothelioma.&quot;
Graham Abbott: mesothelioma diagnosed
Abbott suddenly plunged into meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested that he contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“It turns out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where there was often asbestos insulation on the pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now developing the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people in atypical occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so patients are unlikely to be harmed.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or ate in basement canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to the toxic substance.
For decades after the war, it turns out hospitals were places where, in theory, saved lives for patients, but places that posed a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
Schoolchildren installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands
And it&#39;s not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries, and city halls because of its amazing insulating and fire retardant characteristics.
Schools too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos for the first time in a classroom.
Across the country, in countless chemistry lessons, schoolchildren set up their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
Websites have emerged to highlight the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, innocuous things like floor tiles or shed roofs tended to contain asbestos.
&quot;It&#39;s an industrial poison that&#39;s embedded in so many of our buildings,&quot; says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy&#39;s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could recall was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
Therefore, be careful when demolishing garden sheds.
The effect of a diagnosis, when the disease is known to be incurable, is enormous.
“It takes quite a while to realize that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but realized that I couldn&#39;t focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well I won&#39;t see Christmas again
One of the most difficult things was going from being a doctor to being a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers being bewildered by the amount of information he had to accept.
“It was difficult to grasp everything,” he says.
&quot;I asked my doctor,&quot; How much time do I have? &quot;
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I’m not having Christmas again.
That&#39;s all&quot;&quot;.
Mesothelioma is especially dangerous because it is the mechanics of how we sustain life - the very act of breathing - that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can become stuck in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem arises from inhaling the needle fibers of asbestos,” Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy&#39;s Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were likely to have been exposed while interning at the hospital.
When the needles of asbestos enter the lung tissue, Treasure says, “by breathing, they are pushed out to the periphery where the membrane is.
It is, at its core, an invasive process from the start.
Conventional treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.
Some people think this is worth trying.
Treasure disagrees.
&quot;You can&#39;t cut the pleura,&quot; he says.
It is impossible to approach her with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer &quot;does not respond very well to chemotherapy,&quot; which &quot;works,&quot; but does not cure.
&quot;From time to time there are patients who live long,&quot; says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after being diagnosed, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he fell ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after diagnosis, single-handedly turned into a support and consultation bureau for similar patients.
“Hello Cancer Central,” he said cheerfully when they called.
&quot;He was very positive,&quot; Abbott says.
He was diagnosed 4 years ago and is still very energetic.
First, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life by just a month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, &quot;contrived to make things a little more positive.&quot;
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lange-Lazdunsky, professor of thoracic surgery at Guy&#39;s Hospital.
“We had the advantage that I didn&#39;t need a referral, I just called them and they accepted me,” Graham admits.
The average patient would have to get a referral and approval for funding.
Money is critical for mesothelioma patients to get the best treatment available.
However, when such treatments finally inevitably fail, many sufferers face yet another financial concern — the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
&quot;Asbestos has been known to be unhealthy since 1898,&quot; Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small quantities could put health at risk.
It was then that they started talking about the bad faith of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy&#39;s Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a &quot;full-value settlement,&quot; according to Morgan, as Lawson was unable to unequivocally prove that his mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy&#39;s Hospital.
After an investigation into his death, a spokesman for Guy&#39;s hospital nevertheless confirmed that &quot;the asbestos in the basements in question was removed in the 1990s.&quot;
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, tying fatal exposure to asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after that - has proven to be a big problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many of their former employers changed owners or closed.
Insurance archives may have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that time is on their side, which the plaintiffs, of course, do not have.
In response, serious new legislation was released this year that make it easier for people with mesothelioma to recover compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under this law, a £ 350 million fund of funds, funded by the insurance industry, was created for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but have no one to sue.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could have awarded in a regular compensation case - about £ 120,000.
About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes the £ 350 million represents a &quot;very good job&quot; for the insurance industry.
&quot;This is a deal written by insurers for insurers,&quot; he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time lag had not intervened and mesothelioma patients could track down the companies and file a claim in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly the Secretary of Labor and Pensions, admitted that the law was &quot;flawed.&quot;
However, both Penning and Morgan acknowledge that with seven people dying every day, quick action was needed.
“People are suffering so much and they need help today,” Penning said during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Bill last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lange-Lazdunsky for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasurer, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a triple therapy, in which Lange-Lazdunski boasts a whopping 40 percent of survivors in five years.
Abbott felt a surge of energy.
&quot;This is, of course, one of the most important things,&quot; Abbott says.
You see this in patients all the time.
There is some force that keeps you going.
When you give up, it can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott went for surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no sign of illness.
Then I got a scan in March [2014].
There were several [cancer] spots in my chest.
I was just about to turn 50.
This is not a threat to life.
This is the end of life.
Once again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there is no trace of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things - about finances when I die, for example, or about showing your wife how the boiler timer works.
When you receive bad news, you become bleak.
You need to look ahead.
As Ellie&#39;s father, 16, and Tamzin, 14, it&#39;s not always easy.
“It&#39;s hard for a parent,” he says.
It&#39;s hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a disease, which meant that I would not live to old age.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn&#39;t say much.
These conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced with hope, even a glimpse of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as, ultimately, for Stephen Jay Gould) a dark certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life threatening.

China Refuses to Give Hong Kong the Right to Choose Leaders; protesters swear revenge
China&#39;s parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
The move is likely to kick-start the long-promised protests in Hong Kong&#39;s business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People&#39;s Congress essentially allows the communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
&quot;It did not disappoint our expectations, but it still infuriates,&quot; said lawmaker Emily Lau, Democratic chairman.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And it is obvious that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China&#39;s decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress, said it would be too &quot;chaotic&quot; to allow the popular nomination of Hong Kong&#39;s leader.
Since 1997, when the UK handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has pledged to allow the region&#39;s residents to vote for their head of government starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday&#39;s decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to have a firm grip on the process with a nominating committee tightly controlled from Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who &quot;love the country and love Hong Kong&quot; will be admitted.
The decision came after the summer of some of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong in years.
Behind much of Hong Kong&#39;s pro-democracy campaign is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong&#39;s financial district if Beijing does not guarantee true universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise on the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with government agencies.
In an online statement, organizers said the movement &quot;was considering taking over the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all dialogue options have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We report with great regret that as of today all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the central region will undoubtedly take place.
Government agencies in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing&#39;s announcement for several days, and security measures have been tightened at government headquarters on Sunday, involving police and barricades.
At the heart of the unrest is the feeling that many in Hong Kong are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of residents from the mainland intensifies competition in the field of goods and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong&#39;s values such as democracy and free speech are starting to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations jeopardize business, the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
&quot;The protest they talk about could cause a lot of economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long,&quot; said lawmaker Regina Yip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to see concern that Hong Kong is spinning out of control spread.
This is a view that is bad for investment.
Chinese state media have also reported in recent days in which Hong Kong democracy activists have been portrayed as saboteurs directed by Western powers.
This summer, activists staged an unofficial suffrage referendum that attracted 780,000 participants - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong&#39;s voters.
And in July, tens of thousands marched in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region&#39;s history.
American prom culture comes to university life: freshmen are invited to arrive by private jet
We are delighted to respond to this demand by launching the UK&#39;s first luxury travel service for current students.
The company also offers transportation options such as a private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to leave a vivid impression on the arrival at the university.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service thought about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to transport their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping this year&#39;s students get to university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury.
A company spokesman said that since the service has just launched, no orders have been received yet, but added that &quot;students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks.&quot;
The company also said that while it faces students with a tuition fee of £ 9,000 a year, it hopes to find a market for the service.
Students today are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as out of touch with reality.
Megan Dunn, VP of Higher Education at NSS, said: “This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most students.
Many students who start their university this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis where available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with skyrocketing spending on basic needs before they can even start thinking about doing take out thousands of pounds for something like a simple dorm arrival.
Feminists raise questions about race and police behavior after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri earlier this month.
The newcomers raise their hands, chanting &quot;Hands up, don&#39;t shoot&quot; as they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the killing of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez has noticed a shift in internet conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments prioritized gender over race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions grew in the Midwest and gained national attention, Perez saw responses from white women that centered 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9 murder, personal essays with headlines such as &quot;Thinking Ferguson from a White Woman&#39;s Perspective&quot; and &quot;Feminism Is Not Just About Oppression of Women&quot; appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
“In feminism, I don&#39;t think there are many people who talk about white skin and privilege at such a high level,” she said.
People felt the need to say something about what had happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis we are facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so tied to race, they felt it needed to be pointed out.
For Ohio State University English professor Corita, Mitchell Ferguson laid bare the challenges that black American women face every day, but which are not perceived as &quot;women&#39;s issues&quot; in the cultural sphere.
&quot;I can write something funny on Facebook about what&#39;s going on with me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere,&quot; Mitchell says.
When I write anything about how people of color are being attacked in their own country, the silence is deafening.
“Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships but not public safety?” She asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
From her point of view, black women are not in a position to clearly share these issues; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women now integrate race and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, almost always based on the rape of a white woman,” Hattery said.
A white woman was needed to corroborate the story to justify the lynching.
From Hattery&#39;s perspective, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes such as Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for suffrage would only be effective for one group: women or blacks. ...
&quot;They made the decision to put all their eggs in the basket of voting rights for women, and voting rights for blacks was supposed to come later,&quot; Hattery said.
Looking back at this sort of thing gives us a clear idea of why women of color distrust white women.
We haven&#39;t done anything good.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women won the vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching in the Women&#39;s Association of the South for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group emerged nearly 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
For Mitchell, the rise in white feminist responses to the issues raised by the situation in Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to &quot;catch up&quot; with problems that black women have dealt with for generations.
“Wouldn&#39;t it be great if activists who have this [traditional feminist] ideology took the right to parenting as seriously as they do about the right to contraception?” Mitchell asked.
Second-wave feminists who have made their careers fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now beginning to understand what this means.
Renowned white feminist activist Gloria Steinem, two weeks after Michael Brown&#39;s assassination, took advantage of Facebook and published a scathing article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll demanding that white Americans take more part in racist protests.
&quot;I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger in the body - and perspectives on racial issues that differ significantly in public opinion polls - will be at the forefront of change,&quot; Steinem wrote.
While Steinem vouches for a more intersecting feminism that includes both race and gender issues, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
American Enterprise Institute researcher Christina Sommers, author of Who Stole Feminism ?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are &quot;much more vulnerable than their sisters,&quot; but Steinem&#39;s remarks about Ferguson contradict criticism. which she expressed earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother&#39;s Keeper, to help vulnerable black and Hispanic youths, there was anger from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police relationship with the black community is not the only issue moving the front line of traditional feminism.
Immigration reform has surfaced again, this time as a women&#39;s issue, after US Border Patrol has arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country&#39;s southwestern border this year.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women to support immigration reform, said she only had to share the stories of immigrant women to make the issue important to women.
“They speak for themselves,” said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to [male immigrants], women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories resonate with women&#39;s organizations,” she said.

There are also proposals to give additional days off to employees of enterprises who have passed these sports tests.

The search is under way for a new millionaire southwest of Perth, where one lucky guy will take home nearly $ 1.1 million from the Saturday night lottery draw.
The Harvey newsstand brings gold in the grand prize for the second time in five years, last year winning $ 1 million in November 2009.

The Harvey millionaire brings the top prize winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total winnings of $ 85 million.
Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry, Oleg Pluzhnikov, at a roundtable held by Vedomosti at the 2014 Moscow Motor Show.
The plan was drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted in late September - early October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures relate to electric vehicles and hybrids - Russia already has a plan for the development of NGV vehicles.
The plan (a copy is available from Vedomosti) is designed for 2014-2017.
Criteria for evaluating electric and hybrid vehicles are to be developed and how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the concessional lending and concessional leasing scheme will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of cars, stimulate localization and create a service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015. it is planned to amend the regulatory legal acts to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities during 2015 so that they also stimulate the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of providing it with advantages in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to expand public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include criteria reflecting the effectiveness of supporting the production of environmentally friendly transport and the development of charging infrastructure in the list of indicators for assessing the activities of regional authorities.
The electric vehicle market in Russia is still just emerging - in 2013, about 100 electric vehicles were sold throughout the country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import duty on electric vehicles was zeroed, so sales will amount to about 500 units, predicts Andrey Pankov, chief executive officer of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia.
But even a fivefold growth does not make electric vehicles any noticeable: in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, 2.78 million cars and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says Nicolas Remiz, director of strategic planning and partnerships at Renault in Russia.
Most of the other manufacturers of electric vehicles have taken a wait-and-see attitude towards Russia.
Development of electric vehicles is also available from Russian manufacturers - &quot;&quot;, GAZ, &quot;&quot;, but the output is scanty.
For example, in January - July 2014, according to ASM-holding, AvtoVAZ produced 30 electric vehicles.
Demand is low due to the high cost of electric vehicles, admits AvtoVAZ engineering director Sergei Amanov, there will be no breakthrough in this segment without state support ....
The development of the Russian market of electric vehicles, in addition to the high cost of cars (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, are on average twice as expensive as analogues with internal combustion engines) are constrained by the underdevelopment of the charging infrastructure (there are only a few refueling stations), says Sergey Tselikov, CEO of Avtostat.
Due to the high cost and low rates of cost reduction, electric cars will remain a niche segment of the Russian market in the next 3-4 years, predicts the editor-in-chief of &quot;Auto Review&quot; Mikhail Podorozhansky, Tselikov agrees with him.
In contrast, automakers say that some EV models are already close to the cost of conventional vehicles.
The Russian electric vehicle market has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that &quot;electric mobility&quot; is real; this, in particular, will be facilitated by the emergence of more and more charging stations, emphasizes the President of the BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by the state company Rosseti: several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of a network of gas stations are underway with other regions as well.
According to the director of the Rosseti department, Vladimir Sofyin, the company believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build gas stations throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of various brands.
In addition, Rosseti, as a grid company, does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity; the possibility of doing this with regard to charging electric vehicles is being considered.
Pankov considers the zeroing of customs duties to be the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the electric vehicle market in Russia.
The zero rate will be in effect until the end of 2014, the possibility of extending it, expanding the preferential list is being considered.
Replacing the transport tax with an ecological one (the idea is being discussed and applies to all cars) will also support the market, but not as tangibly as customs preferences, Pankov said.
Transport tax in Russia is low, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where the tax cut has led to a sharp increase in sales of electric vehicles - now they account for 12% of the market.
Russia also needs incentive measures for car owners, for example, free parking in the city center (as already done in Moscow), Pankov is sure, or the ability to move electric vehicles along dedicated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
Private plane crashes in Colorado
A single-engine Piper PA-46 plane crashed in the US state of Colorado.
Three out of five people in it died, ITAR-TASS reports.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the runway of the Denver airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Donetsk region, they are dealing with captured militants of the &quot;Donbass&quot; battalion.
The punishers were surrounded near Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of security officials died under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation in southeastern Ukraine really is, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
Punishers from the &quot;Donbass&quot; battalion survived the &quot;meat grinder&quot; they got into near Ilovaisk.
The militants spent several days surrounded by the army of the Donetsk People&#39;s Republic, practically abandoned by their commanders and the Ukrainian authorities.
When the headquarters reported that it was possible to get out of the &quot;ring&quot; along the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But literally a couple of minutes later, shells and bullets whistled from all directions.
“Judging by the information they gave me, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave,” says the acting deputy battalion commander, who has the call sign “Lermontov”.
And when we descended into the lowland between Mnogopoly and Chervonoselskoye, crossfire began from anti-tank guided missiles, from &quot;zushki&quot;, 30-mm grenade launchers, automatic BMD cannons, and small arms.
There were four cars ahead of me and three behind me, as a result there were only two cars left.
An officer with the call sign &quot;Lermontov&quot; says: almost immediately at least 60 people died, dozens were injured, many died later.
The surviving militants are now being treated by those they have come to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called &quot;terrorists&quot; are treating them well, giving them food and medicine.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and doomed them to certain death.
We were simply betrayed, they say.
The column, the entire battalion, to be destroyed.
In the battalion &quot;Donbass&quot;, like many of his comrades, Aleksey volunteered, because in the Ukrainian news they talked about the atrocities that were allegedly repaired in the southeast by &quot;separatists&quot;.
Already here Alexey saw a completely different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk - and not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me and told me that there was a mortar attack, that most likely it was the Ukrainian armed forces, ”says one of the soldiers, Oleksiy.
After that I wanted to leave the battalion.
They did not let us out of Ilovaisk, they said that we were in the ring.
I have already agreed with the commander, the report has already written about leaving.
We were immediately taken to Ilovaisk from the training camp from Zurakhovo.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were stuck in the &quot;cauldron&quot; near Ilovaisk.
Now some of the survivors admit that if it were possible to turn back the clock, they would never have joined the punitive battalion.
The militia handed over all the prisoners to the security forces of the DPR.
Everyone will be tested for involvement in war crimes.
Headquarters for restricting food prices established in the region
A headquarters has been set up in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, which, if necessary, will limit the rise in prices for food on the regional market.
The decree on the creation of this structure has already been signed.
The staff included members of the regional government, representatives of the executive branch and supervisory agencies.
Together they will monitor the prices for agricultural products in the region.
Vesti Ekonomika - Will Kiev Reimburse Rosneft for $ 140 Million in Losses?
The head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, said that the company estimates the damage from the shelling of the Lisichansk refinery in Ukraine at $ 140 million.
He announced this in an interview with Spiegel.
&quot;We estimate the damage at $ 140 million and we will negotiate with the Ukrainian government to pay compensation,&quot; Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the modernized Lisichansk refinery was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
“There were no battles, there were no &#39;entrenched insurgents&#39;, but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, the technological oil pumped into the pipes disappeared, &quot;he said.
Recall that on July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisichansk oil refinery, an oil storage tank burned down and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
Lisichansk Refinery is the main refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of the enterprise was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichansk refinery is about 7 million tons of crude oil per year.
The plant is capable of producing Euro-4 standard fuel, as well as consignments of Euro-5 diesel fuel.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisichansk refinery were suspended due to its unprofitableness.
It was decided to start repairs at the enterprise.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichansk Refinery along with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-BP.
The DPRK launched a short-range projectile towards the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media, this happened at about 10:30 am local time from the Chagando province, which is located on the border of North Korea and China.
As Interfax was told in the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, the missile allegedly fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.
Ruble falls amid geopolitical pressures
On the Moscow Exchange, the dollar rose 3 kopecks at the open. to RUB 37.15, the ruble fell against the bi-currency basket amid geopolitical tensions.
Trading on the UTS in the dollar started with deals in the range of 37.11-37.2 rubles / $ 1, on average, in two minutes the rate was fixed at 37.16 rubles / $ 1, which is 4 kopecks. above the level of the previous close.
The euro exchange rate was 48.79 rubles. for 1 euro, that&#39;s 3 kopecks. above the level of the previous close.
Dual currency basket price added 3.5 kopecks. and amounted to 42.395 rubles.
The US dollar is trading at 23 kopecks. higher than the official rate, euro - by 16 kopecks. above the official rate.
On Friday, August 29, the Russian market continued its rapid decline, but this time there was no panic.
The ruble also continued to fall in price and even renewed its historical maximum against the dollar.
Now investors are already playing out in advance the deteriorating geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
However, so far it looks more like an artificial hysteria, blown up through the media, especially Western ones.
There are not so many options for introducing new sanctions against the Russian Federation.
TeleTrade &quot;At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to weaken sharply against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains the determining factor.
However, if in the near future we do not see a new negative, both Russian indices and the position of the national currency may correct.
Orenburg Airlines will sue Ideal-Tour
Orenburg Airlines filed claims against Ideal-Tour for a total of 4.7 billion rubles.
We are talking about two cases, sessions on which will be held in October.
Different judges will consider cases.
According to Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on August 14.
Its amount is slightly more than 425 million rubles.
The meeting on it is scheduled for October 7.
The second application was submitted on 18 August.
Its amount is 4.24 billion rubles.
A meeting on it is scheduled for October 2.
As the Russian Union of Travel Industry told reporters, different judges were appointed for the cases.
In July, information appeared in the media about the debts of Ideal-Tour to Orenburg Avilinia in the amount of 1.5 billion rubles.
The general director of the airline, Viktor Zyukin, speaks of the amount of 1.6 billion rubles.
The general director of Aeroflot, Vitaly Savelyev, names an even larger amount - two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to become more interesting for new users
Microblogging service Twitter has changed the user registration process in order to quickly involve new members in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people abandoning their microblogging.
Now, new Twitter users will view during registration a large number of the accounts recommended by the service in order to immediately compose their reading circle.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests indicated during registration.
At the same time, Twitter automatically sets a checkbox for subscription for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to uncheck the boxes with his own hand so as not to read those who are not interesting to him.
If earlier users of the microblogging service saw only avatars of recommended users, now Twitter displays a sample of one of the blogger&#39;s popular tweets to help form an impression of a person.
This is the largest change to the Twitter registration page in three years.
Recently, Twitter has been actively working on upgrading the service.
Such activity is connected, first of all, with the continuing attempts of the service to reach a break-even point.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in user base growth and a drop in reader activity.
The company is currently in desperate need of more loyal customers who, once they visit, would stay for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.
Knowledge Day in Moscow will be chilly and rainy
September 1 in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy throughout the day, according to meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow will be from 16 to 18 degrees, in the Moscow region - 13-18 degrees.
If the weather is cloudy and clear, it will rain in places, and the wind in the eastern quarter will be rather weak - only 3-8 meters per second.
Car scrappage program resumed from September 1
On September 1, the car scrappage program will resume in Russia.
Until December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov explained, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistributing support from other directions.
The program will cover all vehicles over six years old.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand for a car to 350 thousand rubles for a truck.
Earlier, a similar car scrapping program was already in place in Russia.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is assumed not only the disposal of cars to obtain a subsequent discount, but also the possibility, if the car has reached the age of more than six years, to purchase a new one at a discount when the old one is returned to &quot;trade-in&quot; from a dealer, Interfax reports.
More than 16 billion rubles were spent on the previous federal recycling program, which was in effect from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.
Thanks to her, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million units (this is plus 101.4% in relation to 2009).
Coming Out Simulator Creator To Release A Game About Modern Journalism
Game designer Nikki Keys, known for the game Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Keyes started work on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact has only now become widely known.
The game was inspired by the events in Ferguson, where protests are taking place, which began after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a name, will be how the coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a citizen journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where clashes between the police and the population take place.
The hero can take pictures of what is happening in different ways, which will affect the course of events.
If he removes the scene so that the police look like heroes and the protesters look like bandits, the police will begin to treat him better and let him go where an ordinary person cannot go.
If he reports differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into large-scale riots.
Points in the game will need to be collected using the hero&#39;s twitter, in which new subscribers will appear if the photos posted there turn out to be popular.
The game has no name yet.
The release date and platforms it will appear on are unknown.
Keyes, however, posted an image demonstrating how the event can change depending on how the photo of it is taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Keyes explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to devote it not to the protests in the United States, but to the events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media covering the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what happened.
Nikki Keyes is an independent developer that publishes browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about events from the biography of Case himself, is about how a bisexual teenager tries to tell his homophobic parents about his relationship.
Geleta pulls Ukraine into the continuation of bloodshed
With a call to prepare for the next &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of victims, Ukrainian Defense Minister Valeriy Geletey is drawing people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
&quot;Moscow, of course, drew attention to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valeriy Geletey, who announced&quot; the completion of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists &quot;and the beginning of the&quot; Great Patriotic War &quot;, in which the losses will amount to&quot; tens of thousands. &quot;
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the mentioned post on his Facebook page, is a subject for research by specialists not in the military field, &quot;the Russian diplomats said in a statement.
They hardly believe that such statements can belong to the Minister of Defense of a civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the Ukrainian Defense Minister wrote on Monday: &quot;Through unofficial channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.&quot;
At the same time, he said that &quot;the operation to liberate the east of Ukraine&quot; has been completed.

More than 60 Hollywood stars are in horror today.
Hackers cracked primitive passwords in iCloud (data storage) in smartphones, after which their intimate pictures appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
However, not for long.

Tony Stewart crashes back on track
Tony Stewart&#39;s return to the track ended a little more than halfway through the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tire tore on lap 172, ending his performance.
Stewart drove his battered car to the garage and then got out without speaking to the reporters.
His team leader Chad Johnston said the 14 team members are upset but will now focus on next weekend&#39;s race in Richmond, Virginia.
&quot;I wish there was a better attempt and a better finish for him,&quot; Johnston said.
We will go to Richmond and hopefully we can do better there.
Stewart first hit a wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Bush that required repairs to the right side of his car.
&quot;I started the day with a pretty big hope of making it to the finish line,&quot; Johnston said, adding, &quot;It just didn&#39;t work out.&quot;
Shortly after the second crash, Stewart&#39;s car was loaded onto a tow truck, and the team gathered and were ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver while racing on a dirt track in upstate New York.
He decided to come back this week and needed to win either Atlanta or the next races in Richmond to take part in the Pursuit.
He returned to work while investigating the tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took to the track to complain to Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement officials said Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least another two weeks.
No decision was made on whether Stewart would be charged.
The three-time champion was greeted with loud cheers and applause as he was introduced to the race.
Starting from 12th position, Stewart walked in the top 10 at the start of the race, reaching fourth position.
Then, on lap 122 after restarting, Bush&#39;s number.
car 18 left its trajectory at the exit from corner 2 and crashed into Stewart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell behind to 21st position.

Bulgarian prison officials hold a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria held a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital, Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of the old working conditions, which had recently been changed.
The increase in salaries is also on the list of requirements that will be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
During the month, officers symbolically protested the new work schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the union of prison officials met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice on several occasions, no agreement was reached, according to the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).

Members of the Federation of Trade Union Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are expected to join the protest of the prison officials&#39; union.
The army controls the new Thai government
General Prayut (right) appointed Pravit Wongsuwan (left) as Minister of Defense
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prayut Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of the country&#39;s new cabinet, in which more than a third of the posts are held by generals or retired generals.
The representatives of the army received key positions: ministers of defense, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Prayut Chan-Ocha was officially confirmed as prime minister after the king of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to the post.
The 60-year-old military man who seized power in the country in a bloodless coup on May 22 was the only candidate for the prime minister&#39;s post.
He was elected prime minister at a parliamentary meeting.
Earlier, the army has appointed members of parliament.
According to Prayut Chan-Och, a coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations, during which protesters demanded the resignation of the government of Prime Minister Yinglak Shinawatra.
Officially, Prayut Chan-Ocha will be interim prime minister as the military plans to hold a general election in late 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to consolidate its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22
against the background of complete paralysis of civilian power.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country&#39;s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglik Shinawatra.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis has its roots in 2006, when the army ousted Yinglik&#39;s brother Shinawat Thaksin as prime minister.
Both of them are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which more than once ensured their success in the elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the capital&#39;s elite have joined the anti-government movement, which since November 2013 has practically paralyzed the country.
Nobody said that the mussels would be better in the salad, I didn&#39;t promise you that, the waitress from the new Palm brasserie jokes.
We have to formally admit that this is really so, but the mind and stomach remain adamant.
After all, everyone has known for a long time: we say &quot;Belgium&quot; - we mean mussels, we say &quot;mussels&quot; - we mean &quot;Belgium&quot;.
Restaurateurs like to profoundly declare that the success of an establishment depends on three factors: location, location and location again.
There are places that are not so well located, but even excellent, but some unlucky ones.
In short, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe &quot;Gorodok&quot; (in honor of that very TV show), then &quot;Odessa-Mama&quot;, and also a restaurant &quot;Beaujolais&quot; and a beer pub &quot;Druzhba&quot;.
Now there is a pub here again, but not nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Only the tip of the iceberg is located above the ground: a bar counter and a couple of tables, the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But here it is fun, like in a children&#39;s room: red, yellow and green walls, multi-colored chairs, instead of windows there are TVs where mermaid girls swim.
Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg are no longer a novelty, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of draft beer (260-300 rubles per 0.5 liter) and countless bottled beers (170-1550 rubles).
A companionably positive waitress cheerfully presents the menu, telling that &quot;mussels are hearty big seeds&quot;, and it should be noted that the service, despite some shortcomings, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in terms of content, but often very unexpected in performance.
Well, who, for example, is given to foresee that a meatloaf with Walloon prunes (280 rubles) is actually carpaccio, cut so thin, too, that parchment paper seems ugly thick compared to it.
You can feel at least some taste only if you shovel half a plate at once.
Things are even worse with salads.
The classic Liège (260) would be more correct to recognize as a crime against the Belgian people: some withered iceberg, boiled potatoes once upon a time, sour Kenyan beans, stiff bacon chips plus pickled onions for some reason.
You won&#39;t wish a meeting with anyone with such a Liege salad!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partially different, but the impression was also not very positive.
If you could still close your eyes to unripe quarters of cherry tomatoes or overcooked champignons, then why do the mussels look as if they had been thawed and boiled several times in their life!
After all, I already know: there are quite normal White Sea mussels here!
They are served in saucepans &quot;in a sauce of your choice&quot; (490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, the one made from white wine, celery and carrots, frankly did not work.
There are vegetables, but there is no aroma, and whether there was wine there, it remains a mystery.
But frits relying on mussels with homemade mayonnaise are good.
Chicken waterza here is not a stew, thick to such an extent that, depending on your mood, you can decide whether the first or second dish is in front of you, but just a pleasant creamy soup.
The local chef was said to make the rabbit in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
In fact, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: rosemary drowned out everything.
The impression was that this rabbit was fed exclusively with rosemary bushes during its lifetime, which is why the meat acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time, a wonderful rabbit leg was attached - no, just an excellent pear in a caramelized crust.
The waffles at Palm offer not only sweet, but also hearty ones - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce was too watery and the waffles were a little dry.
But the manager who approached the table inquired about the dining experience very informally.
Means, it is worth coming again.
The dollar rate rose above 37 rubles on the MICEX on the news of new sanctions against Russia being prepared by the West.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar in calculations &quot;tomorrow&quot; by 10:29 Moscow time grew by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the euro rate rose by 30 kopecks - up to 48.73 rubles, according to the data of the Moscow Exchange.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous close and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum on February 19, 2009 - then it cost 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37.005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House announced that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are discussing the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is of a long-term nature, both in tandem with the euro and in tandem with the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark, says Anna Bodrova, senior analyst at Alpari.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in the courses one way or another.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today rumors of a troop invasion have not been confirmed on either side, but the market has been very emotional.
All talk that he was resistant to such news was canceled yesterday.
The week, according to the specialist&#39;s forecasts, will close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine - all these are links in the same chain.
Inflation is also predicted to accelerate: 5 to 10% will be added to current prices for the fall.
Soon, moreover, the seasonal fruits and vegetables will run out, and there will be a kind of vacuum while the networks reorient themselves to other suppliers.
&quot;The dollar approached the 37-ruble mark, passed it and came back, there is no powerful hysteria,&quot; says Konstantin Bushuev, head of the Otkritie Broker market analysis department.
They will still be looking to see if the promised sanctions will be introduced on Saturday, how NATO will meet.
The ruble, according to him, weakened sharply after the end of the tax season, then news spread across Ukraine, in addition, the Central Bank said last week that by the end of the year it will completely switch to a floating rate and refuse any foreign exchange interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, then it was no different from the previous ones during this month, everyone was scared by the mark of 37 rubles, the analyst continues.
And so, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful happened.
Let me remind you that there were troubling times for the foreign exchange market, when at the end of January there was an increased demand for foreign exchange, as well as on March 3, when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of foreign currency.
UFS IC also sees the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, this is an increase in the revenue side of the budget from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the rise in import prices, says Alexey Kozlov, chief analyst at UFS IC.
The negative aspects include the rise in prices for imported goods and services.
Sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a result, become the reason for the rise in the cost of borrowing money, which, in turn, slows down the development of the country&#39;s economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smoothes out the decline in share prices expressed in rubles.
For example, the MICEX Index during trading on Thursday fell by 1.67%, while the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of the decline in the indices is explained by the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional in nature and is explained by the massive desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, emotions gradually come to naught, and the ruble quotes partially or completely restore the lost positions.
“We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar,” notes Alexei Kozlov.
A genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
The British reported that she spent many years thinking she would die after being misdiagnosed.
Karin Rogers spent most of her adolescence thinking she had only a few more years to live after being diagnosed with another medical condition.
In fact, she had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
Charitable organization CMT UK said misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are believed to have CMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, unsteady gait and tucked toes.
People who are sick may feel numbness or pain and the condition does not heal and progresses, which means that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich&#39;s ataxia (AF), a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she would be confined to a wheelchair by the time she was 18 and die before she was 30.
A mother of two, now 51, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn&#39;t do what others did.
I fell every day, and it took me longer to complete.
I could never roller-skate or skate with other kids, and I was bullied a lot at school because of the way I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to loosen her Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at her medical file when her doctor left the room and it said she had AF.
“I felt guilty because I stuck my nose where I shouldn&#39;t, and so I didn&#39;t tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association,” she said.
When I received the information in return, I was shocked and experienced the worst panic possible.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in that interval.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she turned 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, &quot;My dear, I don&#39;t think you have this disease because you would already be in a wheelchair.&quot;
I think you have something that poses a much lower threat to life.
After several genetic tests, she was diagnosed with CMT.
“When he explained what CMT was, I thought I was drawing out a lucky ticket,” she said.
The UK CMT charity has announced CMT Awareness Month to try to raise awareness of the disease.
Tax Burden on Washington Zone Entrepreneurs Grows As Economy Recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country rose moderately last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to new research released last week, and companies in the Washington area are no different.
Companies in the county, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid $ 27.6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from the $ 26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on businesses across the state and locally increased 4.3 percent last year to $ 671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, in its third straight year of growth after successive years in which bills decreased in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose faster, 4.3 percent than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study by professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young and the State Tax Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county&#39;s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland&#39;s tax revenue comes from businesses.
Virginia, at 28 percent, brings in the least tax revenue, proportionately, from entrepreneurs.
Much of the rise in tax revenue is fueled by a return to former property values of companies, the researchers say, which has raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years of less than 1 percent growth.
While a large proportion of these revenues come from large states such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same is happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, $ 9.6 billion more than in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent from the previous year.
However, the observed return on property value does not have any similar effect on state and local tax revenue growth in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of corporate tax bills.
Virginia and District of Columbia companies pay about half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes.
&quot;What&#39;s happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around DC, is owned either by the government or a non-profit organization that does not pay property taxes,&quot; said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Tax Center.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent rise in business tax revenues cannot be fully explained by the recovery in the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs&#39; incomes also appear to be on the mend, according to this data.
Companies in the region reported state corporate income taxes of $ 2.3 billion, $ 2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $ 1 billion in corporate income tax revenues, the most in the region.
Although the trends are in the same direction, the tax burden on local entrepreneurs does not increase at the same rate in all three localities.
Growth in the District of Columbia was in line with the national average of 4.3 percent, while growth in Maryland was substantially faster at 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia saw a below-average rise in tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of the three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) at 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the county it is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower state and local taxes for entrepreneurs and an overall better business tax climate than Maryland.
The district was not assessed in this study.
Despite its edge, Virginia is facing competitive pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets for next year, this law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs to even 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better and thus paying more state and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Business taxes paid in the form of personal income tax by small business owners - the transition structure that most small businesses are structured around - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $ 2.4 billion, at a much faster rate of growth. than taxes for entrepreneurs in general.
The researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenues across the country is likely to continue this year, with turnover tax revenues in state and local governments growing 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014. compared with the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may lag behind as lower federal spending affects the region&#39;s labor market.
Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home judo world championship brought the Russian team two silver and seven bronze medals.
According to this indicator, the Russians lost only to the main favorite of the competition - the Japanese national team.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Beslan Mudranov became its owner, performing in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in an equal final fight with Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was decided by only one remark received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian national team - on Tuesday, three medals were won at once.
In men&#39;s competitions in the category up to 66 kg, silver went to Mikhail Pulyaev, and bronze to Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian lost to the 2011 and 2013 world champion Masashi Ebinume of Japan.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost to his compatriot at the quarterfinal stage, triumphantly walked through the consolation tournament and won the bronze medal.
In the women&#39;s tournament in the category up to 52 kg, Natalya Kuzyutina also reached the third step of the podium.
In the semifinals, she lost to the reigning world champion Mailinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who at this championship played under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended her title.
In the dispute for the bronze, Kuzyutina defeated Ma Yingan from China, but after the end of the tournament she nevertheless admitted that the third place was not at all what she had hoped for.
And again, Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutina earlier in the final of the European Championship, became an obstacle on the way of the Russian woman to gold.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg, put bronze in the piggy bank of the Russian national team.
In the quarterfinals, he was offended by the former representative of Moldova, Viktor Skovortsov, who now plays for the UAE team.
However, then the Russian won two fights and became the owner of the award.
Mogushkov played at the home championship with an ankle injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, and therefore will take a break from the competition.
As for the ex-Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal in this tournament.
It is interesting that his other compatriot, who took the sports citizenship of the UAE, Ivan Remarenko, completed his performance in the category up to 100 kg with bronze.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which was won by Ivan Nifontov in the category up to 81 kg.
In a difficult battle of the small final, he defeated the Frenchman Alan Schmitt due to a remark from an opponent.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at the tournament at once, but the Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men&#39;s tournament up to 90 kg.
Kirill Voprosov became its owner, and the Russian team was guaranteed this medal: his compatriot Kirill Denisov was his rival in the consolation final.
However, the fight itself did not take place: Voprosy&#39;s opponent was unable to enter the tatami due to injury.
The men&#39;s bronze was also won by the hosts on the sixth day of the competition - Renat Saidov, who competed in the over 100 kg category, put it in the national team&#39;s piggy bank.
In the consolation final, he won a clear victory over Brazilian David Moura.
This is how the individual part of the world championship ended.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian teams - both men and women - were among the main contenders for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, the fair sex was unlucky - they did not make it to the medal.
But the Russian judokas won the team silver.
In a decisive confrontation, in a stubborn struggle with a score of 2-3, they lost to the main favorites of the competition - the Japanese team.
At the same time, the Russian national team led 2-0 after a clear victory of Khan-Magomedov and a strong-willed one - Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in heavier weight categories, Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) could not cope with their Japanese rivals.
The bronze match in the women&#39;s tournament developed according to the same scenario, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, lost to the Japanese - 2-3.
Russian President Vladimir Putin was present at the team competition in Chelyabinsk, who after the end of the tournament congratulated the men&#39;s team with silver.
&quot;The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could become champions,&quot; said Putin, quoted by RIA Novosti.
Losing to the Japanese, the founders of judo - there is nothing shameful here.
But I am sure that you can win against them.
The Russian national team at the home world championship performed much better than a year ago at competitions of a similar level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
Then the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isaev missed the current tournament.
We are all, of course, great maximalists.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let&#39;s remember that if a person is in the top eight in the Olympic cycle, then he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in such a sport as judo, &quot;- summed up the results of the tournament, the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, quoted by the press service of the championship.
The Japanese national team, as expected, became the best in Chelyabinsk, having won 11 medals of various denominations, five of which were gold.
The next world championship will be held next summer in Astana.

Joan Rivers&#39; family hopes for the best
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
“Thank you for your continued love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had cardiac arrest at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains &quot;severe.&quot;
The response has been widespread, including numerous online support from the likes of Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
All kings can
The debut album of the band Royal Blood is on sale - the new hope of British rock, which brought rock duets from the clubs straight to the stadiums.
The duo Royal Blood has only been on stage for a year, but already has a BBC Music Award nomination, an opening tour with the Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the dressing room of a New York show from Jimmy Page himself.
Their self-titled debut album received 100 thousand pre-orders a few months before the release, and the contract for its release lies in the portfolio of the major label Warner Music.
Considering the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is out of the ordinary, because we are not talking about the new Lana Del Rey or the next sweet-voiced representative of the &quot;new R&#39;n&#39;B&quot;, but about a duet of bullish-looking Britons playing at that volume and intensity, which was last in vogue a couple of decades ago.
In general, the rates for the first album in connection with all the above circumstances were especially high and have already been fully justified.
It was not for nothing that the duo took a name for themselves, which until then could only be encroached upon by very desperate hairy metalheads, and the blood of which kings flows, as it seems to them, in their veins, is also understandable.
This is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aims to shake up the stagnant blood of British rock, bringing it to new heights.
It is perhaps too early to make predictions about the success of this venture, but something can already be asserted.
A dozen songs in just over thirty minutes is not so much a demonstration of a phenomenal composer&#39;s talent as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Certainly, some advantages of certain numbers cannot be denied: for example, the pilot single &quot;Out Of The Black&quot; is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not by the melodic line, but by the drum part.
The musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier to knock than to hum.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful &quot;Little Monster&quot; and the cover song &quot;Better Strangers&quot; with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
The truth is, though, that each of these songs will sound great at a heavy rock party, but when played back and forth, they merge into a more or less uniform canvas.
And this is not necessarily a bad thing, on the contrary.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (they are more likely to be the successors of Motörhead), but they brought numerous rock duos out of the ghetto of indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, is created for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, it is obviously cramped.
The secret is partly in the clever use of bass, replacing the guitar in the familiar format invented in the early 2000s by The White Stripes.
However, it&#39;s not just the instruments, but also the very approach to songwriting.
The heroes of the 2000s retroroot with great difficulty got out of the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance they went to recognize themselves not just epigones, but independent creative units.
Royal Blood already sounds so powerful and impudent that this pressure successfully drapes some secondary and stubbornness of the musical material.
After all, who said that rock has to be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what The Information reported Friday morning: The online store - and the video producer and a hundred other things - is buying the Twitch video streaming service for $ 1.04 billion ($ US970 million).
The news came as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google&#39;s video service for a good billion looked complete, and the combination felt natural.
Founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, Twitch has set itself the goal of being a generic streaming service - a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly morphed into a platform for gamers to stream their in-game moments; &quot;YouTube for real-time gaming,&quot; according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And &quot;let&#39;s play,&quot; a genre of videos in which know-it-alls give (mostly old) games a Mystery Theater-style treatment is already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is mentioned a lot when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met with little interest, a classic example of an entrenched tech company buying out a potential competitor.
It&#39;s a mystery why the YouTube deal fell through, given that it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Sheer: &quot;We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us reach them faster.&quot;
Another secret, to be honest, is Twitch&#39;s incredible success.
For snobs like me who claim to be better off playing sports than watching them, it is difficult to understand the appeal of watching games instead of picking up the joystick.
It&#39;s one thing to look over a friend&#39;s shoulder at 3am as she crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch some outsider get 20 headshots in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them footage without controlling the angle of view yourself can be a headache recipe worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that high-speed playthroughs, in which the Rogers Bannister of our electronic age complete entire games in record time, are entertaining.
But if it&#39;s not about a virtuoso of game or humor, it&#39;s unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique monthly visitors and is the fourth largest source of peak internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon capitalize on this?
It&#39;s hard to imagine Twitch collapsing into Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could simply swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would love to get: the crowds of young men advertisers dream of.
As Twitch CEO Shire said, Amazon and Twitch &quot;both believe in the future of gaming,&quot; and the channel is showing no signs of withering away, not even - oh - as a spectator sport.
The terrorist attack in 2004 killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent several days in Beslan.
We talked with the surviving hostages - almost all of them are now students, with the parents of the dead, with the caretaker of the cemetery - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the Mothers of Beslan committee Susanna Dudieva, an Emergencies Ministry employee who took part in the special operation, - says the correspondent of the Society department Elizaveta Antonova. working on a special project.
Having already returned to Moscow, we met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was the president&#39;s adviser on the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with the officer of the &quot;B&quot; department of the FSB of Russia Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What shocked me especially during the work on this topic is that it was as if Beslan had not been in these ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for everyone who has at least some relation to it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions of the trip are very difficult.
But we must not forget Beslan, and I hope we have coped with our task, &quot;Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the Rambler &amp; Co holding infographic studio, which has been working in the company since this spring.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin&#39;s stay in power.
North Korea launched a short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile into the waters of the Sea of Japan, Renhap reported.
The launch was made at about 10.30 am local time from the Chagando province, located on the border of North Korea and China.
Presumably, the rocket fell into the Sea of Japan, flying about 220 km, said the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
Deputies proposed to speed up the entry into force of the law on personal data
If the initiative is successful, the data of Russians will not be able to be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015
A draft law has been submitted to the State Duma, providing for the postponement of the entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is included in the legislative base of the lower house.
Its authors were State Duma deputies Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov (United Russia), Vladimir Parakhin (Fair Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (Communist Party of the Russian Federation).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to a faster and more efficient provision of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the safety of personal data and observance of the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunication networks.
The law, the entry into force of which is rushed by parliamentarians, obliges to store personal data of Russians processed via the Internet on the territory of the Russian Federation.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, accumulate, store, clarify and retrieve personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation, in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as indicate information about the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right, on the basis of a court decision, to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called &quot;black lists&quot; of violating sites - an automated information system &quot;Register of violators of the rights of subjects of personal data.&quot;
This law was adopted by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoy and Vadim Dengin from the Liberal Democratic Party and Alexander Yushchenko from the Communist Party.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill on the postponement of the entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in the Russian Federation will have to pay rent
Commenting on the bill submitted to the State Duma today, the first deputy head of the Duma committee on information policy, Leonid Levin, said that he sees no problems in postponing the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own storage of personal data of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation will be able to rent them, for example, &quot;from Rostelecom, which has repeatedly said that they are ready to lease their servers. and already provides its servers, from Mail Group, from Western companies, which today already provide their servers. &quot;
&quot;In addition, there are several independent data centers willing to cooperate in this area,&quot; he added.
&quot;If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to operate in the Russian Federation, I see no problems - they will receive technological opportunities for placement,&quot; Levin summed up.
Controversial bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association for Electronic Communications expressed concern that if the draft law was adopted, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking services for air tickets and hotels.
According to the association, &quot;the bill deprives subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data, imperatively determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation.&quot;
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to create a mechanism for informing the user about where the recording is being made, systematizing his personal data.
In this case, he himself will be able to choose in which territory the specified actions will be performed.
The adoption of similar bills on the &quot;localization&quot; of personal data in other countries led to the departure of global services and to significant economic losses.
A test participant with a bucket of ice water dislocated her jaw
Isabel Roberts from the UK screamed so hard when ice water was poured over her head that she damaged the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket ordeal had gone painfully wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after screaming so hard during a test with a bucket of ice water that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabel Roberts screamed so violently when ice water was poured over her head that it damaged the structure of her face.
“The water was so cold I screamed, but when I did it my jaw started to get stuck,” she told The Mirror.
Water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabel Roberts seconds before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but it did not close, it got stuck, and then it came to me that something was wrong.
Then the same understanding came to my mother and sister and they began to laugh, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old UK woman was rushed to hospital to have her jaw set after participating in a popular hobby on Tuesday.
The clip became an internet sensation and was posted thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Militias handed over 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The Army of Novorossiya claims to have shot down a Ukrainian Su-27 and accuses the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
As of 10:00 on September 1, the militias handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead servicemen.
This was reported to &quot;Interfax&quot; by a representative of the press service of the &quot;Army of Novorossiya&quot;.
He added that &quot;air defense forces shot down a Su-27 aircraft near the settlement of Mereshki, which violated the ceasefire agreement.&quot;
According to the interlocutor of the agency, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions during the shelling of the Luhansk airport.
The spokesman noted that the militias managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force at one of the field airfields overnight, as well as destroy two armored personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
&quot;Losses in enemy manpower - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, 13 people surrendered,&quot; the headquarters representative summed up.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the &quot;people&#39;s republics&quot; of Donbass announced the transfer of 223 prisoners of war and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine to the Ukrainian side as part of the ceasefire.
At the same time, at night, the DPR army, according to the &quot;Army of Novorossiya&quot;, &quot;thwarted an attempt by the National Guardsmen, in violation of the previously reached agreements, to withdraw heavy equipment from the encirclement area.&quot;
Then the militias reported the destruction of two tanks and two infantry fighting vehicles in a fleeting battle, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 servicemen.
According to the headquarters, the total enemy losses in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupol) for that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored combat vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian military personnel was surrounded by militias in the Ilovaisk area of the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the &quot;people&#39;s republics&quot; to release the Ukrainian servicemen from the encirclement.
The DPR agreed to do this on condition that the enemy surrendered weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of servicemen began to leave the surrounded settlements on Saturday morning.
According to Semyon Semenchenko, the commander of the &quot;Donbass&quot; battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense, who was surrounded, 14 more people left the &quot;cauldron&quot; on Sunday night.
On his Facebook page, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded were &quot;held captive by the 137th regiment of the 32nd Russian division and the 9th tank brigade of the Russian Federation,&quot; where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian Defense Ministry denied reports of the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures if the EU introduces new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry reports.
The report of the Russian foreign diplomatic department says that the &quot;conclusions&quot; of the European Council of 30 August demonstrated the inability of the EU member states to overcome the inertia of their reckless support of the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on &quot;absolutely unsubstantiated allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country,&quot; the agency&#39;s website says.
The Russian Foreign Ministry expresses regret that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, succumbs to the influence of countries that are interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full-fledged &quot;dialogue between the warring parties,&quot; the ministry emphasizes.
Also on the website of the department it is noted that now there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded, and the number of civilian casualties is also growing.
Recall that within the next seven days in the European Union, it is planned to develop specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives work closely with American officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate with each other the introduced measures by the period of action and the degree of severity.
New EU sanctions may affect the energy and financial sector.
Also, the Australian government announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the areas of defense, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Tricky Ways to Save Money on University Textbooks
With university textbooks costing more than $ 1,000 a year for many students, Matt Schroeder, who will soon be entering his sophomore year, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He devised a system for how to borrow books from undergraduates, offering them nominal compensation to delay selling them.
“I got my $ 180 math textbook for a semester for $ 10 and a Chick-fil-A cookie,” says Schroeder, 19, who is attending Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature for the past semester would have cost $ 430, he says.
He spent $ 120.
According to the Council of Colleges, the average student spends more than $ 1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have a number of options to cut those costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online shopping and creative ideas like Schroeder&#39;s system.
Renting books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use a book for a semester, and is often significantly less expensive than purchasing one.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that book rentals have doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented during the past spring semester, said Trevor Meyer, vice president of Nibo.
Less than half of all books are purchased from university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here&#39;s an introductory course on the best ways to get a great deal.
Purchase in the online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of Mathematical Analysis by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler costs about $ 290 list price, but a new copy can be purchased for $ 239.99 from Chegg.com, which specializes in textbook sales.
Buying used
If you don&#39;t mind other people&#39;s marks or damage, secondhand textbooks are a good option.
Mathematical Analysis sells for $ 93.49 pre-owned on Chegg.com.
Matt Kasaday, 25, a fourth year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand copy of Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding the Business of the Advertising Business.
The book sold for $ 48 new.
Educators such as Ingrid Bracey, director of College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, invite students to check with their professors to see if they can use previous editions.
Sometimes updates are irrelevant to the class.
In such cases, older editions can often be found for a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative for buying used books.
Rental
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you are good enough with them, remember to return them, and do not want to keep them for yourself after the course is over.
You can save over 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent Math Analysis for a semester for about $ 20.
Find out the rules of the store where you borrow the books, including any fines you may be charged for marks, underlining, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember that if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes these books are actually rented by purchasing an electronic license for a specified period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc.
Renting Math Analysis from Chegg.com for six months will cost you about $ 61.
Bracey says literature students can often find the best prices because many classics are now free to download, while science and engineering literature can be quite expensive.
In spite of everything, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start his studies at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the prices of the book, as this will ensure that you are looking for the exact text you want.
Before ordering online, Gault says, be sure to check to see if the book is actually in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was delayed by four weeks, and in the end he paid full price at the university bookstore.
Putin declared the complete ineffectiveness of the Far East Development Fund
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.
&quot;15 billion rubles remained on deposits,&quot; the president stressed.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to speed up the approval of the list of priority development areas in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this fall.
The Federal Assembly, the president noted, had not approved the list of priority development areas in the Far East and their criteria until July 1.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, there is an increase in the transport accessibility of the region, the removal of infrastructural restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create prerequisites for attracting additional investment to the region, as well as to form territories of advanced development, which should become competitive in relation to the key business centers of the Asia-Pacific region, the president emphasized.
As a reminder, it was previously reported that the advanced development area could replace the SEZ.
Why Guardians of the Galaxy Failed to Save the Box Office
Sylvester Stallone&#39;s The Expendables 3 returned less than $ 30 million from its $ 90 million US budget, while Sin City: A Woman Worth Killing For Only returned $ 12 million from its $ 70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz&#39;s &quot;Home Video&quot; only grossed $ 14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children&#39;s films such as How to Train Your Dragon 2 also disappoint in revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin points out that when it comes to children&#39;s films, it may be the poor quality of the films themselves.
Colleen called 2014 the &quot;worst&quot; year ever for children&#39;s films and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a barely &quot;functioning&quot; sequel to fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at slightly older audiences, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of each film released in the summer of at least 2,000 copies between Memorial Day in May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinions of both moviegoers and film critics, suggest that this year&#39;s film harvest is similar in caliber to last year&#39;s hits.
Some commentators have speculated that it could be due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming internet services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on the upcoming Disney movie The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website, &quot;I think times are changing.&quot;
We must admit this and not try to chase what came before.
In contrast to the current drop in the box office in Hollywood, Netflix&#39;s streaming service revenue reached $ 1.2 billion, nearly double last year&#39;s $ 837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized studios for relying too heavily on comic book franchises and predicted the &quot;collapse&quot; of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators have argued that there was some truth to his gloomy predictions.
With several potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic Park, other members of the film industry are more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kienberg recently called the box office drop simply &quot;cyclical,&quot; telling the Hollywood Reporter, &quot;Next summer will be the highest grossing summer in history and no one will worry about it.&quot;
Food sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a nightmare.
And in general, public catering still prefers to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
&quot;It&#39;s better to eat lightly salted cucumber than bad mozzarella,&quot; says Mariano Valerio, the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti, about the quality of the cheeses offered by suppliers instead of Italian ones.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ran out first in the restaurant, they have a short shelf life.
Stocks of Parmesan should be enough for another couple of months.
What to do?
Switch to Russian?
In 2005 I was at the Dorogomilovsky market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes, which is clear: shocking memories do not let him go to this day.
The meat was lying there on carts only 30 centimeters from the floor!
There are cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don&#39;t know, maybe everything has changed there now.
But the other day they brought me a sample of fish from the Far East.
So it turned out to be rotten!
I said that I don&#39;t even want to talk to the person who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many things usual for Italy are a wonder for a Russian manufacturer.
Several years ago I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hung in a refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It should hang down to soften so that the muscles relax.
I did it all with local beef.
Then they asked me: where did you get such tender meat?
I said: so this is yours, Russian!
Why doesn&#39;t anyone do that?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti, in the French restaurant &quot;Brasserie Most&quot;, there is a stop list in the kitchen that lists the missing items: French oysters, sea urchin.
The chef of the Brasserie Most restaurant and the Strelka bar, Regis Trigel, is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced with oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss ones.
However, Regis also becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: “Cauliflower - 200 rubles!
I ask: &quot;Why, on what basis does it cost so much?&quot;
They answer me: &quot;Well, we also need to earn money.&quot;
But this cabbage shouldn&#39;t cost more than 80 rubles!
We buy Far Eastern oysters by weight, but they live 15-20 years, can you imagine how much their shell weighs?
For the price, it turns out that this is a super delicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of horror stories for foreign chefs.
Standard story: &quot;The first three months everything was fine, then the quality plummeted.&quot;
Main complaints: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many European restaurants don&#39;t know what will happen to them when they run out of cheese.

Sanction menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are called mainly food sanctions.
It is forbidden to import beef, pork, meat and poultry by-products, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yoghurts, cottage cheese, cheeses, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups into the country.
The restaurants began to leapfrog with suppliers: food prices have risen, an urgent need to look for analogues from other countries.
Most of all, this will affect the expensive restaurants with monokuchens in France, Italy, Spain, to which the products were supplied directly from the &quot;parent&quot; countries.
Catering had to be rebuilt before.
For example, when in early 2014 the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, the suppliers established beef supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions in the summer of 2014 turned out to be much more serious.
True, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the ban Atlantic salmon and trout fry, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sweet corn, peas and onions for sowing.
Italian Valerio hopes that the sanctions can be softened further.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist in conditions of uncertainty.
According to the company &quot;East-West&quot;, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
&quot;Expensive restaurants will have to change their menu to match what local farmers and other countries produce,&quot; says Sergei Mironov, restaurateur and owner of Restconsult agency.
If the chef is strong, this will not be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such chefs, and it can take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the restaurant &quot;Brasserie Most&quot; is ready for this: you will have to give up 10-15% of the dishes, and rework half of the menu.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine, they are already beginning to replace dishes, for example, marbled beef steak with beef stroganoff, says Sergei Mironov.
&quot;Cheese from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile,&quot; Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of the East-West company, lists.
Cream and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the USA can be replaced with chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway - salmon, salmon, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated for by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, it will be easier for budget chain restaurants to rebuild than for the premium segment: it is unlikely that gourmets who could distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian went there.
Although it will be difficult for the Ginza Project establishments, he said.
The Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace, &quot;says Mironov.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the lack of owners in the country.
Cafe owners of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European ones.
But there are also many restaurants that will hardly be affected by the sanctions.
These include establishments with the cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
&quot;There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine,&quot; says Khatuna Kolbaia, owner of Saperavi Georgian restaurant and Wai Me! Cafe.
All cheeses are made for us in Russia, many dishes are based on chicken fillet, we do not use exotic greens. &quot;
Kolbai&#39;s establishments have not yet removed a single dish from the menu.
Timur Lansky, the owner of Chaikhona N1 restaurants with Uzbek cuisine, is not embarrassed by the sanctions either: he will have to change only lamb for New Zealand.
If Russia establishes imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even gain in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, ”he says.
You can get tenderloin, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits cheaper from the CIS.
Moreover, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than &quot;plastic&quot; from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Everyone knows about Uzbek tomatoes that they are delicious and sweet.
Nobody says that about Spanish.
After the introduction of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, Olimboy Artykov, said that he plans to double the export of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Fast food restaurants that responded to Deng&#39;s request are also quite calm about the sanctions.
McDonald&#39;s press service said localization is over 85% and the chain works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the department for work with suppliers of Subway Russia, the chain buys about 80% of the products in Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise with the supply of vegetables and the rise in prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In Teremka, &quot;sanctioned products&quot; generally accounted for no more than 4%.
The sanctions did not affect the noodle &quot;Wokker&quot; either.
KFC, Burger King and Little Potato did not respond to Money&#39;s request, but other market participants argue that Burger King&#39;s localization is significantly less than that of McDonald&#39;s.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurateurs are ready to buy more Chilean than Russian Far Eastern
On your pink salmon
In the meantime, restaurateurs complain that due to increased demand, prices are rising even for local products.
&quot;Prices for food for Grablya have increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio - twice,&quot; says restaurateur Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will grow by 5-10%, Kolbaia admits.
&quot;East-West&quot; does not deny this: &quot;For example, Belarusian dairy products have risen in price by 10-15% since the beginning of August.&quot;
&quot;Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled the price of pork,&quot; complains Sergei Rak, deputy general director of Stardogs.
Chicken legs have risen in price by 35%.
We are waiting for prices from China, maybe they will cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned increase in prices by 8%.
Now, and so it is very undesirable to raise prices, - says Rak.
According to statistics, the growth of catering revenue for the second quarter of 2014 was only 1.8%.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is unclear how quickly: so far, most restaurateurs have stocked up on food for the next two months, hoping to wait out the swings in purchase prices.
But no one knows what will happen in two months.
On the square in front of the Moscow City Hall there are ten tents decorated with greenery and wood.
In the center is the stage, the musicians are playing a waltz.
This is a festival of regional products with the funny name &quot;There is a time to eat&quot;.
“In general, we have been planning to make a festival of local food for a long time, but here are the sanctions, we hurried, organized a festival,” says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with the musicians, the Greek chef Anastas prepares a salad of pasta and homemade sweets, the other day there was a master class on cooking borscht with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tents there is an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, venison from Salekhard, vegetables from the Lenin State Farm near Moscow, cheeses from the Russianized Italian Jay Close.
&quot;Salmon for restaurants can be safely replaced with other salmon fish from the Far East,&quot; says Philip Galkin, owner of the Svoi lyudi fish store.
We catch sockeye salmon, chum salmon, coho salmon, pink salmon, chinook salmon - &quot;royal salmon&quot;.
Yes, they are not as oily as Norwegian salmon because they are wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take it in your hands - it does not even move.
And you can&#39;t hold our Far Eastern salmon in your hands.
Only establishments agree to replace Italian mozzarella with domestic
In the window of his tent there are shrimps labeled &quot;Magadan&quot;, cod, omul, muksun, mussels from the Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin is sure that it is high time to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, the fish catch in Russia in 2013 is more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Fish import in 2013 - about 800 thousand tons.
The Svoi Lyudi shop has been operating since 2012; it sells fish through an online store; before the introduction of sanctions, it served a dozen more restaurants, for example, Simple Things.
Now Galkin has received applications from 15 more restaurants.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, - he gets excited.
We got confused, tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is several times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In support of Galkin&#39;s tent, a portion of &quot;Philadelphia&quot; with chum is being prepared for me.
Unlike rolls with salmon, these have to be chewed longer, but the awareness that this fish is ours, domestic, gives strength.
There are even halibut and sea bass rolls on the site of the Svoi Lyudi shop.
In sushi bars, however, they prefer to replace Norwegian salmon with Chilean.
Galkin explains this by the fact that chefs are too lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
“The suppliers have not offered us Russian fish yet,” explains Dmitry Evseev, owner of Killfish Bar.
The situation is approximately the same with other products: Russian manufacturers could occupy the vacant niche, but this is not happening.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project Boris Akimov, now we can talk more about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large multinational corporations there with powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace illegal imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, large producers of other countries will benefit from the ban first of all, &quot;says Akimov.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
As a result of massive unscheduled inspections of Rospotrebnadzor, the activities of three McDonald&#39;s enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
&quot;We are studying the essence of the claims presented to determine the actions necessary for the earliest possible opening of restaurants for visitors,&quot; the press service of McDonald&#39;s told Dengam.
In fact, no one understands what will happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says an employee of a restaurant consulting company on condition of anonymity.
If McDonald&#39;s starts to close across the country, the scenario will be very different.
&quot;Europrotokol&quot; instead of the traffic police certificate
Casco payments can be received without a traffic police certificate - this is how the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the &quot;Europrotocol&quot; in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft directive, according to which from September 1 this year, in order to receive hull insurance payments, an insured motorist will be able to do without a traffic police certificate.
This, however, is only about those cases when the accident was registered according to the &quot;European protocol&quot; without the participation of the traffic police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in an accident, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the established limit, and both drivers have reached an agreement on who is the culprit of the accident.
From August 2, the limit of payments under the &quot;Europrotocol&quot; is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to 400 thousand rubles.
The bottom line is that often, even with minor damage, in a situation where an accident can be issued according to the &quot;European protocol&quot;, the drivers who have been involved in the accident call the traffic police.
Indeed, in the presence of a comprehensive insurance policy, it was impossible to receive a refund on it without a certificate from the traffic police.
The parameters specified in the draft directive are precisely designed to remove this obstacle to the implementation of the &quot;Europrotocol&quot; in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for comprehensive insurance in connection with an accident, issued without traffic police officers, should not be lower than the limit for the &quot;Europrotocol&quot;.
But at the same time, it cannot be higher than the limit specified in the Casco insurance contract.
The idea is, of course, useful and theoretically capable of unloading both traffic police officers and the roads.
But, most likely, neither motorists nor insurers will be delighted with it.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat of the growth of fraud, which may lead to the introduction of new rules for casco payments.
As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the age-old Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for hours for the inspector to register a minor accident, because it is safer that way.
And it is still unknown what will be easier - to defeat the scammers or convince the drivers of the reliability of the &quot;Europrotocol&quot;.
Savings certificate will be made personal and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban bearer savings certificates, but it will allow banks to make them an analogue of an irrevocable deposit.
The Treasury is preparing a bill that will ban bearer savings certificates.
Recently, this tool has been gaining popularity, since the rates here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that bearer savings certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank, since there is no need to make contributions to the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) fund.
The piquancy of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and Sberbank and Bank of Moscow will suffer from it, which, according to the DIA, control 98% of the core market.
Moreover, the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency&#39;s estimates, is about 3.5%.
The problem, the DIA explains, is that the clients of a small bank who have bought such a certificate, in the event of their license revocation, are trying to get money from the DIA.
Some depositors who do not have sufficient financial literacy and buy bearer savings certificates may assume that their investments are insured.
Reasonable lack of insurance payments on these certificates in case of revocation of the bank&#39;s license may lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the agency&#39;s practice, there were cases when holders of bearer certificates tried to recover insurance compensation through the courts, &quot;the DIA said.
The problem, of course, is far-fetched.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of certificates anyway, since, according to the law, they have no right to compensation from the state.
If the matter was that the instrument was not insured in the DIA, metal accounts on which citizens&#39; funds are accounted for in grams of one of four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium - would be banned along with it.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, however, no one encroaches on their existence so far.
The point is most likely that bearer certificates are a very convenient security that can actually act as a quasi-money.
At the same time, their movement is practically uncontrollable: any client of the bank can buy a certificate, transfer it to any citizen, and before cashing such a certificate can change many owners.
It is no coincidence that the bill stipulates that a savings certificate must necessarily be a registered security, which must be kept in a depository.
And in order to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right to early redemption.
That is, an analogue of an irrevocable deposit is being introduced, which bankers have long dreamed of.

Germany to send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, ITAR-TASS reports on August 31, citing a decision taken following a meeting of representatives of the FRG government headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Reportedly, Germany will send to Iraq 30 Milan portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges for them, as well as 8 thousand G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Deliveries will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian aid.
On September 1, Ms Merkel will make a government statement on this topic in the Bundestag.
Until now, Germany has not supplied its weapons to hot spots.
The opinions of the inhabitants of the Federal Republic of Germany about the dispatch of weapons to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the fighters from the &quot;Islamic State&quot;, others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militiamen knocked out a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militias knocked out a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31.
According to available data, this happened in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokino and Bezymennoe (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media outlets report shelling of two coast guard boats.
It is clarified that the incident took place today at about 16:20 Moscow time.
The teenagers were picked up by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage Bushwalkers were taken by helicopter to safety after spending the night stranded in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old boy went camping on Sunday afternoon at Govets Lip in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8pm when they did not return home.
A search party was sent, which included local police and a rescue team, and the couple was found around 11pm near Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and bruised his head.
The officers stayed with the couple overnight and were hoisted up on a winch on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance in stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two unions met
The high-level talks in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the top officials of the European Union met with the top officials of the future Eurasian
Even on an alarming occasion (the situation around Ukraine is urgent), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discussed a number of &quot;hot problems&quot; for the first time.
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively is not clear; but it is clear who skimmed the cream off this summit.
Questions on this score disappeared on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, and after them other Eurasians and Europeans saw the new President Lukashenko on the TV news.
The Belarusian leader set an example of polished courtesy, it was the behavior of a man who had just hit the jackpot and is planning a dignified old age in high society.
How Maidan Lukashenko helped
The arrival of three main European commissioners (EU ministers) in Minsk at once, who met with Lukashenka and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf, is not just a legitimation of the president with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European politics and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Denis Melyantsov, senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies, is sure that from now on Brussels will not be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
&quot;The fact that Catherine Ashton met face-to-face with Lukashenka gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to unfreeze,&quot; he told Ogonyok.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the Belarusian authorities began preparations for a breakthrough long before the November Maidan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
“Results have been achieved with the EU as well - these are successful negotiations on simplifying the visa regime and readmission, dialogues on modernization,” Ogonyok’s interlocutor lists, “and negotiations were held with the United States on international security.
The states even lifted a few sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the leadership of Belarus to them only spurred this process.
On the one hand, Minsk managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for punishing pro-Russian militias in Donbass with all severity, did not quarrel with Moscow either.
Minsk did not leave either the Customs Union or the CSTO, and a Russian airbase is located in Baranovichi.
Brussels and Washington noticed the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it, Belarusian experts are sure.
How successful Lukashenka’s movement towards political diversification will turn out to be can be seen from how often Minsk will soon host meetings in the EU + CU format.
The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy Catherine Ashton could not promptly answer questions about what Brussels expects from relations in the new format.
Ashton&#39;s press secretary, Maya Kosyanchich, only told Ogonyok that against the background of resolving issues of war and peace, this topic is not a priority.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan could become the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of top officials in the new format.
A fly in the ointment for Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that, it turns out, he was personally asked by the representatives of the European Union.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: all sides are not opposed to Minsk remaining the central platform for meetings both in the Russia-OSCE-Ukraine format and at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the &quot;last dictator of Europe&quot; is acquiring the status of a completely handshake European leader who is helping to solve a global problem.
The best friend of a European farmer
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, prompted the conclusion that the main reason for the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbass, but the economy.
Indeed, the timetable for future negotiations on gas supplies and overcoming the concerns of the CU countries on the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement, drawn up at the meeting, looks like a more ambitious achievement than peace declarations without specific dates and numbers.
Trade Commissioner Karl De Gucht, however, indicated: EU representatives &quot;came to Minsk to look for a solution to the political crisis, which has economic consequences, and not vice versa.&quot;
It seems, however, that the economic crisis in Ukraine is &quot;working&quot; for Belarus.
Its consequences - and above all the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still experiencing sanctions pressure, a long-awaited room for maneuver.
According to the head of the Mises Research Center, ex-presidential candidate Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus for the supply of agricultural products to the Russian Federation, bypassing the sanctions.
At the same time, supply schemes are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin chided Minsk at the summit.
“The initiators of these schemes,” stressed Romanchuk to Ogonyok, “are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
For a long time they worked out schemes for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
Russian business desperately needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to setting up production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials, also with an orientation towards the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers export about $ 4 billion to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be in great demand. &quot;
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the platform for negotiations between the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenka from the point of view of developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow&#39;s sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has now offered farmers only 125 million euros in compensation.
The Belarusian president may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact on European farmers.
This can raise Lukashenka&#39;s authority in the EU to an unprecedented level.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk is denying its active role in the birth of the CU + EU format, and the Belarusian leader, at a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, stressed that Kiev was the initiator of the new format.
“It was your proposal to get together, discuss without any heap, not to make a decision, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to understand the situation that was developing in Ukraine at that time,” he addressed the cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to reassure Moscow, which, according to rumors, was initially opposed to Minsk&#39;s mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic department diligently emphasizes that Belarus, when organizing interaction between the EU and the CU on its land, does not pursue selfish goals, and the ultimate goal of this format is to create in the future a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“This is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation, is putting forward and promoting in other areas, in particular in the security sphere,” the Belarusian Foreign Ministry told Ogonyok, a department that has been scrupulously choosing words lately.
Paid entry zones may appear in Moscow
The Moscow government is considering the option of introducing zones with a toll entrance as a method of dealing with congestion on central roads by analogy with other major cities in the world, reports M24.ru with reference to the Deputy Mayor of Moscow for Transport, Maxim Liksutov.
One of the options that has successfully proven itself is toll entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, see all the pros and cons.
It is too early to say that any decisions have been made on this matter, &quot;Liksutov said.
The deputy mayor stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and workload to Moscow, is very important for the capital&#39;s authorities.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already ongoing construction of the central ring road, Liksutov added.
The recently started construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there was a sufficient bypass infrastructure, then there would be no need to have transit traffic in Moscow, &quot;the deputy mayor said.
Also, Maxim Liksutov said that the introduction of paid parking has significantly relieved the capital&#39;s streets.
And, according to him, the city authorities do not plan to stop there.
Recall that on August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital Sergei Sobyanin took part in the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the first start-up complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (TsKAD).
Sinful boredom
Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez has revolutionized what one might expect.
The first &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005), filmed with minimal but symbolic involvement of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the chain &quot;thesis - antithesis - synthesis&quot;, which is fundamental for modern thinking (if we mean the universe of noir by the thesis, and the cosmos of comics by the antithesis).
Henceforth it should be read: &quot;thesis - antithesis - chaos&quot;.
Sin City 2 is chaotic both on a dramatic and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar from the first &quot;City&quot;, although, behold, the thug Marv (Mickey Rourke), I remember, ended his life in the electric chair, and here, nothing, only manages to snatch - in the role of a kind of people&#39;s vigilante - knives from the air and other axes with strangleholds.
But the old people are literally pushed aside by the newcomers, as if bursting into the city from some other film, the meaning and plot of which the audience is asked not to worry about.
So, the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has its own story, shamelessly cut short by the authors at the most interesting place.
The lustful frigid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and Dwight (Josh Brolin), who take revenge on her, have their own.
But this confusion, in which Dwight, say, cannot be distinguished from Johnny&#39;s face - especially since the faces, like other parts of the body, are demolished to the characters with inexorable regularity - is not a problem and not even half the trouble.
Well these are not people, we understand that these are noir archetypes: a fatal bitch, an overly confident gambler, a detective who has fallen into the &quot;honey trap&quot; of sex, a corrupt ghoul senator.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and the archetype drives, then this is no longer a movie, but read that abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is simply ridiculous.
Plus, even in this hectic world, there is something permanent.
The battle whores from the first &quot;City&quot; still hold a perimeter defense against the forces of darkness besieging their native slums.
Yes, and the ghost of Detective Hartigan no, no, yes, and look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always nice to look at.
The main problem of Sin City 2 is different.
Frank Miller was good at combining comics and noir as a draftsman, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to transfer comics to the screen.
Comics and noir are two aggressively opposing &quot;realities&quot;.
The comic book phenomenon in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, at the same time when Dashil Hammett&#39;s novels &quot;Bloody Harvest&quot; (1929), &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1930) and &quot;Glass Key&quot; (1931) created canon noir, then called hard -boiled school - &quot;cool school&quot;.
Or pulp fiction.
Comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from Popeye the sailor - a spinach eater that gives him heroic strength, Superman, Batman and detective Dick Tracy to the Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other &quot;avengers&quot;.
But in any movie based on comics there was something flawed: the drawn characters stubbornly did not want to become overgrown with screen flesh, remained pretenders in the &quot;real&quot; world around them willy-nilly.
Simply put, they were completely devoid of &quot;existence.&quot;
Noir, on the other hand, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional romance - with experiences, characters, family scandals and a historical background - lost all credibility.
What Forsytes, what Thibault and Rougon-Maccara, what even Bolkonsky and Rostovs are generally conceivable after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into a soap opera format, and a criminal - that is, by definition, marginal - novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett learned the hard way what it was like to work as an orderly at the front.
He was a communist.
By the way, such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassin, Joseph Losey, Edward Dmitrik were at least close to the Communist Party.
Therefore, noir, the archetype of which they set, is, firstly, rude and cynical, and secondly, purely social.
This is almost an American version of socialist realism.
The first &quot;Sin City&quot; was remarkable precisely because it unnaturally, but organically connected comics with noir.
For the first time on the screen, a comic strip came to life, not in the least ashamed of its graphic nature, and did not pretend to be a &quot;real&quot; film.
The gloom of the corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered the murders, and the senator covered the monstrous sadistic son, was quite worthy of Hammett&#39;s pen.
And the picturesque details like the severed heads with which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the genius James Ellroy, the author of &quot;The Black Orchid&quot; and the best - that is, declaratively sickening - representative of the neo-noir.
Sin City 2 is not even a retreat, but a surrender of the radical Miller-Rodriguez style to the comics tradition.
Probably, this was largely due to 3D technologies.
When you watch the second &quot;Sin City&quot;, you feel yourself enclosed in a glass ball, inside which snow falls asleep in a toy cesspool.
However, most often it is not snow, but bloody scraps, but by and large, what&#39;s the difference?
Well, there is nothing to say about sociality.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, here and there, sometimes, albeit on the side of a dirty swamp, there is a normal world where you can return a girl who has gone along a crooked path or, say, tell inconsolable parents that her destroyer has been punished ...
When in the city of sin there is no place for anything but sin, then sin is no longer a sin, but a norm.
Boring, like any norm.
The chaos of Sin City 2 is just boring.
For the sake of justice, the domestic rental gave this insipid sin a little, but peppercorn.
The credits warn: the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
In relation to the spectacle, in the very vegetarian episode of which a person is broken with forceps, it smacks of hellish humor.
Hammett would have liked it.
France&#39;s socialists must &quot;shut up and get France in order,&quot; says key ally Frasoy Hollande
Monsieur Wall called on the deeply divided left to &quot;show warmth&quot; towards the attacked socialist president, whose reshuffle did not find the overwhelming approval of the French.
The President deserves everyone&#39;s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It is our duty to stay by his side,” he said to a round of applause.
As a gesture of conciliation, the prime minister has pledged that his government will not question the controversial 35-hour workweek in France, despite controversial proposals, it should relax the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economic minister, earlier this week. ...
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande pleaded with his fellow Socialist Party members to remain &quot;one&quot; with the government.
But Christian Tobira, Minister of Justice, put a spoke in the wheel when she attended a meeting of dissenting Socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for letting the French &quot;lose faith in the future.&quot;
Marine Le Pays, leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for the constant internal conflict among the socialists, saying that she had no idea that Vall&#39;s new government would last more than a few months.
François Hollande is a naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Vall, forced to assemble a new government when the previous one did not last even a summer.
&quot;Nor will the new last fall or winter,&quot; Ms. Le Pen told reporters.
She echoed her party&#39;s call to dissolve parliament, saying she is confident the party can easily win early elections and is ready to rule.
France&#39;s ruling party was defeated in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A poll by Sunday&#39;s Journal du Dimanche found 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is in danger of splitting up into several rival factions before Mr Hollande&#39;s end in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Sians Po, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to mend the economy and record unemployment.
&quot;He&#39;s short on time, but public opinion needs to quickly sense that something is changing,&quot; he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
&quot;City without drugs&quot; left without a lawsuit
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court left without consideration the claim of the administrative directorate of the regional ministry for state property management against the City Without Drugs fund.
The department intended to collect more than 7 million rubles from the organization. as payment for renting a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice.
Today the Arbitration Court of the Sverdlovsk Region left without consideration the claim of the executive directorate of the Ministry for State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) against the City Without Drugs fund (one of the founders is the mayor of Yekaterinburg Yevgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect 7.3 million rubles from the organization. as rent for the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff twice failed to appear in court, which is why a decision was made to refuse the consideration.
The representatives in the directorate of MUGISO could not explain the reason for the absence; the head of the legal department, Maxim Titov, did not answer phone calls.
It was also not possible to contact the representatives of the fund.
As a reminder, we are talking about a mansion that has been occupied by the foundation in the city center at 19 Belinsky Street at no cost since 2011.
This decision was made by ex-governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the administrative directorate of the Ministry for State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court to evict the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the department demanded through the court that the contract for the gratuitous use of the premises of the memorial mansion be recognized as not concluded.
In the opinion of the MUGISO directorate, the agreement did not contain essential conditions for the lease of the cultural heritage site.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed the claim, then an appeal was filed with the 17th Arbitration Court of Perm, which was satisfied.
Then the foundation filed a cassation appeal against this decision to the same court, which remained unsatisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the foundation in the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court sided with the directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was signed, according to which the fund began to pay rent again, the head of the city Yevgeny Roizman told about this.
The rent was set at 300 thousand rubles. per month.
The previous regional administration gave us this building for free use, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration has decided differently, &quot;he said.
Tatiana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why was the mayor of Yekaterinburg offered to leave voluntarily
On July 24, the deputy of the City Duma of Yekaterinburg United Russia Alexander Kosintsev suggested that the mayor of the city - speaker of the City Duma Yevgeny Roizman resign.
The reason was the criminal case against the arrested on suspicion of the murder of a pensioner of the City Duma deputy Oleg Kinev, who is considered an associate of the mayor.
How Evgeny Roizman found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of &quot;libel&quot; (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg Yevgeny Roizman.
This was reported at the MIA General Administration for the Sverdlovsk Region, where Anna Filatova, Director General of the Zashchita Legal Center, applied with a corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her in his blog entries of being involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that &quot;this is another attempt to avenge the truth.&quot;
iPhone will be turned into a wallet
Ahead of September 9th, when Apple is due to unveil its new developments, there are more leaks in the press about what to expect from the presentation.
Citing sources, American media reports that the sixth generation iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project between Apple and Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re / code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple, among other things, may announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which a mobile wallet function will be available in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse to comment on this.
This function allows you to make a payment at the checkout of the store using your smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user by his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be the first to integrate NFC (near field communication) technology, which allows contactless payments using a smartphone and a corresponding reader at the checkout.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
For the first time, the NFC function was presented back in 2004 in the framework of cooperation between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that entered the so-called NFC Forum, an association for the promotion of this technology.
The first phone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC - the Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay using their Android smartphone.
However, American experts emphasize that, despite the large investments of high-tech companies in promoting NFC technology, American retailers are still cautious about the innovation and are not too willing to spend money on equipping their stores with such systems.
Therefore, now observers hope that Apple&#39;s entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their retail outlets.
French Foreign Ministry: Paris&#39;s position on deliveries of Mistrals to Russia does not change
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal announced the unchanged position of Paris regarding the delivery of Mistral-class helicopter carriers to Russia.
“I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Hollande) in an interview with Le Monde on 20 August:“ Today, the level of sanctions does not impede the supply.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France, &quot;&quot; RIA Novosti quotes Mr. Nadal.
So the representative of the French Foreign Ministry answered the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will affect the change in the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract.
Read more about the supply of helicopter carriers to Russia in the material of the Ogonyok magazine &quot;The Mistral is almost ours.&quot;
National Security Council of Ukraine: seven servicemen were killed in the zone of power operation over the past day
The representative of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Andriy Lysenko said that over the past day in the combat zone in the east of the country, seven Ukrainian servicemen were killed and another 25 were injured.
The situation near Ilovaisk is extremely difficult.
Until the operation to withdraw troops from the encirclement is completed, details will not be announced.
At the end of the operation, data on the losses and the reasons for the situation will be made public.
Those responsible for such a situation will be held accountable, &quot;added Mr. Lysenko, refusing to discuss the situation near Ilovaisk in more detail, where several Ukrainian battalions were surrounded.
According to a representative of the National Security and Defense Council, &quot;everything possible is being done to return the prisoners of war,&quot; ITAR-TASS reports.
Mr. Lysenko also noted that the Ukrainian military withdrew from the Luhansk airport in the direction of the village of Georgievka.

Norwegian Cruise approaches $ 3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire its sister company Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $ 3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a $ 6.8 billion company with a market value of $ 6.8 billion, access to luxury cruise ships and affluent customers of Prestige Cruises as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp ( CCL.N).
The deal could be announced as early as this week, sources said Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fall apart.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
Sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations are not open.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while an Apollo spokesman declined to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes spanning North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Her revenue was $ 2.57 billion in 2013, a 13 percent increase over 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that sail to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It posted revenue of $ 1.2 billion in 2013, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
The $ 29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
Companies are racing to position themselves as the preferred cruise operators of these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with US regulators for an initial public offering in January 2014.
Apollo became the main shareholder of the company following a $ 850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it is today in 2000 through a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), an entertainment and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Tay.
Apollo invested $ 1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting owned 28 percent, Apollo owned 20 percent, and private equity firm TPG Capital LP held 8 percent in the company as of late June, according to reports.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of cruise passenger traffic in North America, according to filings at Prestige Cruises&#39; first public offering.

The money will also go to purchase equipment, repair the roof and power supply systems in the building of the TV and radio company, founded in 1959, RIA Novosti reports.
Hong Kong Democratic Movement Activists Disrupt Chinese Representative&#39;s Speech The Day After An Election Decision Is Made
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress on Sunday dictated the procedure by which only two or three candidates will be allowed to run for Hong Kong&#39;s presidential election in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the support of a majority of the members of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it nearly impossible for the Democratic opposition to get on the ballot and has prompted Democratic activists to pledge once again to stop Hong Kong&#39;s financial center with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing&#39;s publication of a document describing China&#39;s control of Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in the Special Administrative Region, and hundreds of thousands marched into the city&#39;s downtown area and staged a sit-in.
Lee&#39;s briefing is being organized by the Hong Kong government and the China Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress Zhang Rongshun and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Bureau of the State Council Feng Wei were also scheduled to speak at a series of briefings throughout the day.
The student activists said they would gather outside the Hong Kong head of government in the afternoon.
Britain made no mention of democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to the BBC, the decision to annex the land of South Bethlehem is connected with the desire to pay back for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Defense Ministry announced the seizure of territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administration on the West Bank.
Sahib Arikat, a spokesman for the Gaza Strip, said the world community should hold Israel accountable for &quot;ongoing settlement activity on the West Bank and East Jerusalem.&quot;
Putin demands from Kiev to start negotiations on &quot;statehood&quot; of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports of his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the &quot;statehood&quot; of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean to hint that separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region an opportunity to defend its rights and interests.
But Putin&#39;s call for the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-Russian rebels as equals was in line with the obvious strategy he has followed since the bloodshed began five months ago: Help the separatists seize territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossiya de facto independence in order to get closer to Russia, rather than with the West.
In an interview with state-run Channel One, Putin denounced the Ukrainian military campaign to reclaim separatist-held territory in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were annexed in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists recently named the occupied territories Novorossiya, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes peace talks will take place in the near future, as Ukrainian politicians begin campaigning for the October 26 parliamentary elections and as government forces attack peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, is &quot;a prisoner of illusion.&quot; , ITAR-TASS reported.
&quot;We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations, and not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, in order to respect the interests of the people living there,&quot; he said.
Peskov said Putin&#39;s words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in jeopardy.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the autonomy they need, Peskov said.
This is not an issue for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, &quot;because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.&quot;
The intervention of a Kremlin spokesman to correct the &quot;misinterpretation&quot; of Putin&#39;s words underscored the Russian leadership&#39;s decision to deal with the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than openly seizing Crimea, where the majority of its 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much harder battle to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as the majority of its 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russian, and polls before the conflict showed broad support for the desire to stay inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, effectively handing over to the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would connect mainland Russia with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, houses the main Russian navy, as well as commercial maritime establishments and historic seaside resorts.
The regions between Russia&#39;s Rostov Oblast and Crimea are also home to mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested during his June 7 inauguration speech that Ukrainian lawmakers, after new elections, weigh constitutional amendments to give breakaway regions greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy appears to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, which Moscow is accused of arming and inciting.
Putin&#39;s latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals follows fresh rebel offensives last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a formerly peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the start of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.
This entailed a massive civil and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a 500,000-resident steel port that sits between Novoazovsk and a narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a gathering of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that had been independent for 23 years.
&quot;We are approaching the point of no return,&quot; Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military men and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take specific measures; leaders have called for drafting tougher sanctions against Russia to be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two convoys of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support struggling separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine&#39;s National Security and Defense Council told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly held in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion were traded Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said Sunday.
Nude photo scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gaby Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten has expressed his disgust at the hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée Gaby Greco and a whole roster of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of candid photos of nude Jennifer Lawrence hit the internet in a massive celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker responsible is said to have about 60 candid photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and superstars including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Leah Michele, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne-based Greco also allegedly have their photos stolen in an iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, told Confidential, &quot;It&#39;s disgusting.&quot;
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is based in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was &quot;shameful&quot; and that those targeted &quot;felt they were being invaded.&quot;
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two of her naked by the pool.
Palmer&#39;s film work includes Love and Honor opposite Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of &quot;Chuck&quot; Strahovski and actress from &quot;Sucker Punch&quot; Browning, did not comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
Representative Lawrence told TMZ, &quot;This is a blatant invasion of privacy.&quot;
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his indignation at the hacker, tweeting: &quot;Posting photos stolen from a mobile phone is really no different from selling stolen goods.&quot;
Just from a legal point of view, the publication of stolen photographs cannot be tolerated.
Potential Way to Steal Nude Celebrity Photos Discovered
The massive hacking of the stars&#39; accounts may have been done through a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
A potential scenario for the development of events was described by The Next Web.
A script in Python was published on the Github resource that allowed brute-forcing passwords for Apple&#39;s Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of your iPhone.
To access it, the same bunch of Apple ID login and password is used as for access to the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed brute-force to find out the password from Find My Phone.
With this method, all possible combinations of characters are sequentially entered, starting with the most frequently used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that in the Find My Phone service the number of entered password options is unlimited.
If the security system is properly organized, after several unsuccessful attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and the user should be informed about the hacking attempt.
Due to the vulnerability, users did not receive any messages about an attempt to guess the password for their account.
The hackers learned the Apple ID password and used it to access iCloud.
According to a Twitter post from a Hackapp user, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a password brute-force script was written for it.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user of Hackapp and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is typical for many services, however, he noted that he has no evidence that such a vulnerability was used to access the &quot;stars&quot; account.
This is not me, plz RT
Extraneous entries once again appear on the Prime Minister&#39;s Twitter
While there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has been a wave of malicious activity using the service in the past.
Hackers took control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that in this case, the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Twitter of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev was also hacked earlier.
If the attackers gained access to iCloud in the manner described above, then the password to the account of the head of government in the microblogging service could also be stored there.
The Next Web was unable to obtain Apple comment on the Find My Phone vulnerability.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian pentathlete
Russian President Vladimir Putin has granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anna Buryak.
The corresponding decree was published on the Internet portal of legal information.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and turned to the Federation of Modern Pentathlon with a request to provide her with the opportunity to play for the Russian national team.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European Championship in the individual championship and became the world champion in the mixed relay, which is one of the new types of program in this sport.
She holds leading positions in the current season.
According to the rules, in order to compete at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she will need to obtain a special permission from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to the chess player Yekaterina Lagno, a native of Lvov, who is a two-time champion of Europe (2005, 2008), world blitz (2010) and rapid chess (2014).
As part of the women&#39;s team of Ukraine, the athlete became the winner of the Chess Olympiad in Turin (2006), the World Team Championship in Astana (2013) and the European Team Championship in Warsaw (2013).
Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation stopped investigation of the Tu-204 disaster at Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (TFR) has closed the criminal case on the fact of the crash of the Tu-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline.
This was reported by the press service of the department.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and flight engineer.
The forensic examination showed that the cause of the crash was an increased approach speed, the crew&#39;s failure to comply with standard landing procedures, as well as the inadvertent exit of the engines at increased forward thrust speeds.
The Tu-204 of the Red Wings airline, flying from Prague to Moscow, crashed on December 29, 2012 while landing at Moscow&#39;s Vnukovo airport.
The aircraft rolled off the runway and caught fire.
The aircraft commander, co-pilot and flight engineer were killed at the scene.
Two flight attendants were taken to hospitals, where they later died from their injuries.
Three more flight attendants, hospitalized with grievous bodily injuries, were undergoing long-term treatment.
In addition, a car driver who was driving along the Kiev highway at the time of the accident was seriously injured.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
After the crash, the transport prosecutor&#39;s office conducted an audit in the Red Wings, during which numerous violations were revealed.
In February 2013, the airline&#39;s license was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.

Anger turned out to be the most universal and functional human emotion
An angry facial expression is biologically universal for humanity, and each organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not accidental, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists from Australia and the United States have found.
They talked about their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be read in a press release from the University of California at Santa Barbara.
The angry facial expression - drawn and dropped eyebrows, thin lips, swollen nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and even children who were blind from birth, who have never seen it, make it, notes lead author of the study Aaron Sell.
In a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion arose to effectively handle disputes during conflict.
The more physical damage one person can inflict on another, the more opportunities he has to dictate his terms, and he communicates this to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
The researchers found confirmation of their other hypothesis: physically strong people are more often angry and go to assault, consider themselves entitled to impose conditions unfavorable for them on others, and also prefer forceful methods of resolving conflicts over peaceful ones.
Based on the fact that anger is primarily a &quot;bargaining emotion&quot;, the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create an angry expression on the face should make the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thus force them to agree as soon as possible with its terms to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers simulated faces on a computer, where each of the seven elements of an angry face was present or absent, and showed them to informants.
Although the drooping eyebrows or the protruding chin separately did not make the face angry, the participants in the study unanimously recognized the person depicted with such features as physically stronger.
Human anger, like that of animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one&#39;s own strength, forcing one to agree and submit.
A person flares out his nostrils and purses his lips for the same purpose as a frog that puffs up, or a baboon that displays its fangs.
&quot;Anger&quot; is triggered by the refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes a form that most effectively demonstrates to the opposite side the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of the angry face is arbitrary, they all express the same thing, &quot;said anthropologist John Tubi.
The Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications offered to allocate 250 million rubles to the TV and radio company &quot;Crimea&quot;
The Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications proposed to allocate 250 million rubles from the federal budget to the autonomous non-profit organization &quot;TV and Radio Company&quot; Crimea &quot;&quot; in 2014.
This is stated in the draft government decree prepared by the department, with which Lenta.ru got acquainted.
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be directed &quot;to cover the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space on the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the purchase of equipment.&quot;
In particular, the allocated money will be used to re-equip the hardware-studio unit, video walls, central control room and video server room.
It is also planned to purchase a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter.
In addition, from the allocated funds, the company will pay for the use of a fiber-optic communication line (FOCL) and for the repair of the energy system.
Subsidies will be provided within the federal budget funds provided for the Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications.
The State TV and Radio Broadcasting Company &quot;Crimea&quot; was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
Today, the coverage of the television signal of the TV and radio company is more than 75 percent of the territory of the peninsula.
In 2011, Krym TV and Radio Company received a license for television broadcasting in digital format.
