28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in a stairwell at a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says he can't imagine someone wanting to hurt him, noting, "Finally, he was doing well."
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Bureau of Medical Examiner said.
The San Francisco Police Department says the death has been classified as a homicide and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, told ABC's KGO channel in San Francisco that Frank, a former hands-on line chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at San Francisco's Sons and Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons and Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that works as a close-knit family and will be greatly missed," the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Luis Galicia said that Frank used to stay in hostels, but lately "finally things were going well for him."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn't imagine someone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of connecting with the family was always to cook us some dish, to cook us dinner," luis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any quarrel.
He was a brother who was adrift.
"With all the bad things that are happening to this world, he was the uncut diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.

Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
An international team of biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is a Greenlandic polar shark that can live for about 500 years, RT reports.
Scientists conducted radiocarbon analysis of the eye lens of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five meters long, can be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that a low metabolism plays an important role in the shark's longevity, which leads to slow development.
Female Greenland sharks reach puberty only by the age of 150.
Previously, it was believed that the longest vertebrate animals live "neighbor" shark - Greenland whale.
The oldest specimen known to scientists was slightly older than 210 years old.

Is it worth going to a sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief physician of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
We need spa rest not only for treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In the conditions of the sanatorium, a person can check the state of his body and get recommendations from a doctor how to live, so that his health is not destroyed.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, it should not be brushed off.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And about 90% of visitors experience stress.
And it is most affected by people from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55 years.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and give yourself time to rest.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable holiday for the whole family.
So if you want to spend your holidays with your children, you don't have to part with them.
For children, even the youngest, there are wellness programs, which include both diagnostic services, pediatrician consultations, tests, and therapeutic.
For example, swimming (many sanatoriums have children's pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, physical therapy.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor, taking into account the individual indications and features of the growing body.
In addition, the sanatoriums usually have a children's club with animators, where children can attend play classes, various workshops.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with babies, provide the necessary conditions for infants and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
Mild winter, long summer, an abundance of sunny days in the year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round rest in the resorts of the Caucasus Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are carried out indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, spa treatment is desirable to conduct twice a year, especially people of adulthood.
The main feature of the Caucasus Mineral Waters region, of course, is the therapeutic mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect different systems of the body.
Water varies in temperature, salts, general mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor picks up the water depending on the patient's well-being.
Thus, "Narzan" has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating effect, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Essentuki-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces the level of sugar.
"Essentuki new" has an anti-inflammatory, bile and diuretic effect.
The same effects have the water "Slavyanovskaya."
When prescribing water, the doctor necessarily takes into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks up less salty water because salts hold the liquid, which leads to increased pressure.
Taking mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and a specific temperature.
Now various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are available in the sanatoriums.
What types of recovery, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained at the resorts of this region?
Near Piatigorsk, for example, there is a salty lake Tambukan, the mud from which is useful for joints, spine, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, absorbing, immunomodulating effect.
These are wellness walks on individually composed routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Resort Park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is in close proximity to the mineral spring "Narzan."
There you can also take baths of wine, pearl, iodine, selenium, sage-lacic, depending on what you appoint a doctor.
Let's prolong the fruiting.
What can be done to make the harvest going until the end of the season?
Yulia Belopukhova, an agronomist and dacha, tells the story.
Tall tomatoes it's time to arrange a haircut: remove new stepsons, cut the tops, remove all the leaves until the penultimate brush with fruits and inflorescences with small ovaries - do not have time to ripen.
All tomatoes regardless of the "constitution" as well as peppers and eggplants are fed ash-superphosphate hood, treated with biologics (The grower - to accelerate the pouring and growth of fruits, Phytosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamair, Bactofit - from diseases, Immunocytophyte - to increase immunity, Bitoxybacillin, Lepidocid).
Of the chemicals at the end of summer should be used only copper vitriol, colloidal sulfur and green soap.
We do the last watering of plants.
Long-haired cucumbers in the greenhouse are lowered from the trellis so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lay on the ground, watered with warm water and a solution of Circon, sprinkled with stem 5-7 cm of compost.
Extend the fruiting of courgette is also easy: cut off old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, sprinkle fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against night cold, set an arc above the bed with a sheltered material.
Keep the plants open during the day and close after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists saw signs of Russia's recovery from the longest recession in the last twenty years.
According to analysts polled by Bloomberg, Russia's GDP is showing positive dynamics - in the second quarter GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This figure is the lowest since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data of Rosstat, the decline of the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development have also recently announced the stabilization of the situation.
There is slow growth ahead.
According to CBD experts, the recession in the Russian economy is a thing of the past.
"The index estimate of Russian GDP shows that the recession is behind us, and the slow growth of the economy is ahead," the Bank of Russia's bulletin "What Trends Say".
The regulator's experts raised the modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter the decline in Russia's GDP stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared GDP decline was 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter the recession stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was within 0-0.15," RIA Novosti quoted the representative of the IER as saying.
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the past five quarters indicates that the bottom has passed.
Among other markers pointing to signs of a rebound in the national economy, Bloomberg cites rising demand for electricity and rail transportation, a revitalization of business.
If we make an amendment to the fact that the year is leap, it is clear that the dynamics in plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to the additional working day.
Add to this the lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it is difficult to get accurate data, and plus or minus 0.5% of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality," explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, reducing price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2% compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks Rosstat has been fixing deflation.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has strengthened by 12% since the beginning of the year since the beginning of the year.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy," Yakovenko stressed.
In addition, since April, Russia has seen an increase in industrial production.
In June, the index increased by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover is slowing down from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
The situation in the labour market, where the unemployment rate fell to 5.4%, also shows positive dynamics.
It was only below in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the good situation in the labor market, the issue with real disposable incomes of the population to leave much to be desired.
In annual terms, the figure is reduced by 4.8%.
This factor can hinder the economic recovery, as household spending contributes a considerable contribution to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia's rigid policy can also be cited as risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which does not affect the real sector in the best way.
A negative factor is the insufficient level of investment, which hinders the development of industrial capacity.
But in general, we can assume that by the end of the year the rate of decline of the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015," said Irina Rogova, an analyst at Forex Club.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and perfectly accustomed to winter sports at the Olympic Games in Sochi, is not so actively developed in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and advocated by former foreigners, in most cases we are talking about natives of the countries - the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro we can observe the reverse process - quite a large number of Russians are speaking under the flags of other states.
In each case, the history of the change of nationality is different.
Some parents were taken to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone could not stand the competition for a place in the Russian national team.
And someone thought that abroad will be created better conditions for development in sports.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The 27-year-old's German passport says her name is Lisa Red.
But she used to be, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to do athletics.
As well as her sister, Lisa chose pole vaulting.
If she had stayed in Russia, she would hardly have been able to move Elena Isinbayeva from the throne.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be our only countrywoman, albeit a former, in the pole vaulting sector.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze of the 2010 European Championships and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the evangelical direction.
In large part because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, the family had eight children.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena began to get carried away with wrestling in high school.
Showing good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued her classes at the U.S. Wrestling Training Center under another former Russian, Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
But at the World Cup in the same year - victory.
Before that, by the way, she managed to win silver at the world championships in 2010.
Then there were the bronzes of 2013 and the silver of 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in Yaroslavl, where she first got acquainted with synchronized swimming.
But it would be wrong to say that she was brought up by our coaches in Russia.
Soon the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Maria continued her studies.
Soon she was already a member of the U.S. national team and showed great results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level it can not compete with Russian synchronists, but for America its indicators - the ceiling.
A new name, which in Russian sounds strange, Kristina Shaldybin received at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue teaching the girl rhythmic gymnastics overseas.
Up to this point, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
After emigrating to the United States, she quickly joined the youth team of this country, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, of course, she did not have to fight, but for the U.S. she organized a real breakthrough - brought the star-striped team to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former "artists" - Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who plays for the German national team.
Jana was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more prospects to get into the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 London Olympics.
There, however, Yana was able to take only the 17th place, not enough to get into the final competitions in the personal championship.
But two years before that she managed to win a bronze medal of the Olympic Games - youth.
Another gymnast, only this time sports - Irina Sazonova.
If the ways of emigration of the athletes mentioned earlier can be called standard, the choice of Irina's family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a pupil of Volgograd sports school.
Naturally, in Iceland she immediately became the champion of the country.
However, Ira trains in Russia - specially comes home, so as not to lose his skills.
In Rio, she didn't perform as well as she would have liked.
The best place is 40 in the individual all-around.
There is very little information about swimmer Maria Ugolkova in the Russian information space.
Maria has been living and training in Switzerland for a very long time.
However, for a long time she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a record of the country in the distance of 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she became a Swiss citizen and began performing under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance was 14th place in the 4×100 comprehensive relay.
To get to the games, she launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6,000 francs, which allowed her to pay for the preparations for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle wrestler Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time winner of european championships, a champion of Russia, a master of sports of Russia of international class.
When he stopped getting into our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For several years the talented wrestler disappeared from the sports boardwalks.
The triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and got a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
About another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, in his homeland is known even less than even about the Swiss swimmer Maria Golkov.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Michael began to engage in gymnastics.
He has not achieved much success at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in qualifying on parallel bars.
But even getting to the Olympic Games in gymnastics is a breakthrough for New zealand.
When Nastya, who was born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There the girl continued her synchronized swimming classes, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, she took 6th place in synchronized swimming.
In a duet with Eugenia Tetelbaum Anastasia took the eighth place.
In the solo program she was fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kreuter plays for the Israeli national team.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry became the national champion.
In the same year he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Kreuter also won the gold of the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to high jumps, Dmitry is engaged in long jump and triple jump.
31-year-old Albert - another native of Khasavyurt, who after long speeches for Russia decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the Krasnoyarsk School of Higher Sports Excellence, even becoming the national champion in 2011.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the USSR national volleyball team player Yaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before the birth of his son Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
There the family remained permanently residency.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became the bronze medalist of the European Championship, held in the territory of his new homeland.
Khadzhiyev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and ended up with his family at the height of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original target was Norway, but in this northern country could not get - had to go to France, nice.
There, he continued to learn freestyle wrestling.
He soon won the world junior championship and later qualified for the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the tournament to fight.
And again freestyle wrestling, and again the former Russian.
This time we will talk about a native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain - Taimuraz Friev.
At the end of December 2012 he was granted Spanish citizenship and is currently playing for the national team of that country.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to celebrate high results in Russia.
He won bronze at the national championships in 2007 and 2008.
Tired of not falling into the national team, Taimuraz decided to change his sporting citizenship.
The last on our list is a Chechen boxer born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Makhachkala - Artur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began to engage in boxing.
Since then, Arthur has won the Canadian championship three times, and in 2012 he became the world champion among young people.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won gold at the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Why should children need Cossack classes in schools?
According to The Governor V. Kondratiev, "Cossacks should be brought up not by actions and parades, but systematically."
They should grow and from at least 7 years to understand that they Cossacks and education should be Cossack.
But so far this work, I think, is carried out formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes will take in all the positive things that have been accumulated earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I will be happy.
If everything is in a hurry and unknown how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
Housing and utilities continue to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
There are encroachments on the funds allocated to the communal sphere from the budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General's Office, inflated tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the housing and utilities sector.
As a result, consumers of the region overpaid more than 170 million rubles to the energy industry.
Recently, the prosecutor's office of the Krasnodar region revealed the facts of inclusion in tariffs unreasonable costs.
And in the expenses of "IV-consulting" LLC (supplies cold water) were laid 4 million rubles for the rental of cars at a price above the market price.
And there are a lot of such examples in the country.
People give the last money for the "communal" and pays properly - according to the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is charged with several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of proceeds of crime, abuse of power, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, work on them actually was not carried out, but paid.
Businessmen just gave him back most of the money.
And as the owner of the Criminal Code, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers did not pay and spent it on their needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and residents - millions of rubles.
Makarov's scheme of machinations, alas, is typical of Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the Criminal Code, who embezzled money from citizens, swept across the country.
The trial of A. Koman, by the way, is also a former deputy of the city council, who is accused of fraud for 91.7 million rubles, continues in Kamchatka.
According to investigators, in 2012-2013 in Elizovo Kamchatka region he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited companies.
One of them performed contract work for the Criminal Code, the other two played the role of cash centers, that is, took money from the population.
However, A. Kohan did not transfer funds to the energy industry, but spent money on himself, his beloved.
It is quite difficult to sue in the field of housing and utilities.
Cases are not initiated, protracted.
And "helps" in this extremely confusing housing legislation - believes Svetlana Urotneva, executive director of the "UKH Control"
We do not have time to earn one law, as we come up with a new one, which should make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, on housing and utilities issues.
Lawyers themselves admit that housing law in universities receives very little attention.
The Prosecutor General's Office also speaks about refusals to initiate criminal cases and red tape during the investigations.
Of those in production in 2015, less than half of the crimes in production were sent to court.
The rest of the investigation was protracted and one in five suspended due to the failure to set the accused.
Often, shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement agencies are written off by them on gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the investigative bodies are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of forgery - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
In the first five months of this year, their number increased only slightly - 99.
And what is the falsification of the minutes of the meeting of tenants?
This means: a change of house management, financial and other issues go bypassing the opinion of the owners.
And it means that the market of housing and utilities can not break through normal companies that want to work honestly, and not "milk" the population.
It turns out that tenants are in the red, small and medium-sized business too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such in the whole state, - Anton Sharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property, is sure.
And now this work is actively underway.
These are not just isolated actions - it is a deliberate course to fight corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, the capital does not smell scandals.
Why are there no such scandals in the housing and utilities sector in Moscow, as in many other regions?
Because the capital government has shown an iron will and brought order," Anatoly Vyborny, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, told AIF.
I am referring to the personnel issue, the legislative amendments, and legal education.
Management companies are under close supervision, and all of them have gone through licensing.
Complaints of citizens are quickly resolved in the public space (and appeals of residents, and response measures are posted on the portal of the government of Moscow).
Many people do not just pay monthly receipts, but closely monitor what it says, how the house is kept.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and the obligations of resource providers and management organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow checks the validity of tariffs on housing and utilities - because a large part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Probably, all this together explains the calm situation in Moscow.
So, everything rests on the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe you should change your job on your own?
A Turkish gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to abandon his friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has issued an ultimatum to the United States, offering a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of orchestrating the coup.
He said this while speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to withdraw their support for the "fethullahist terrorist organization."
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the U.S. calls for a change of position.
Experts believe that the rift in Turkey's relations with the West is growing and could lead to a new attempt to change the power in the country.
"Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO (the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization).
Either the coup d'etat of FETO or democratic Turkey.
She must make that choice," the Anatolian news agency quoted Erdogan as saying in Ankara on Wednesday evening.
The Turkish President once again, but already tougher demanded from the U.S. to comply with his demand, voiced by him for the first time immediately after the suppression of the rebellion.
Recall that on the night of July 16 in Turkey high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army attempted to overthrow the legitimate government in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Erdogan made an appeal to the population, the mutiny was suppressed, and its organizers and participants were arrested.
In total, about 8,000 people came under suspicion, in the ranks of which, in addition to the military, were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan's supporters also admitted that the Americans could be involved in the coup.
The U.S. denied all the claims, refusing to extradite Gulen and advising him to change the tone.
The last statement of state department representatives on this issue was made at the time of Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the Turkish president - he insists on his own and also puts forward demands to his other Western partners.
"Ankara will cease to fulfill its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not name the date of lifting visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Omer Celik said on August 9.
According to him, Ankara's amendments to the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, will jeopardize Europe's own security.
On August 1, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open borders to migrants in order to achieve the facilitation of the visa regime with the EU.
His words were a response to a statement by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Another provocative statement Cavusoglu made last Wednesday, admitting that Turkey can withdraw from NATO.
The Turkish Foreign Minister did not rule out that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance if it did not receive the expected support from it.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defense sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign states in the defense sphere - they import missiles," Cavusoglu said in an interview with Anadolu news agency.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
"So far, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member states, but the results have not satisfied us, and we began to look for others," the minister said.
Experts believe that all this speaks about Turkey's serious disagreements with the West and the reorientation of the country to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Examination Yevgeny Minchenko believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot make a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot tied to the West both from a business and military point of view (Turkey is a nato member), so I think Erdogan will try to balance by maintaining a framework with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a completely obedient person in this post," the expert explained to AIF.ru.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (about non-payment of compensation to the EU, the demand for visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the United States) he will be pressured.
"Recep Erdogan will face deteriorating relations with both America and the European Union, and they will put pressure on him on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governing the country and so on," Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for Political Information Alexei Mukhin admits that the Turkish president will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as it becomes profitable for him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely tough stance against Russia and in all ways sought favor in the West.
In a very short time the situation has changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that the Turkish president will not change his priorities again after some time.
I think that Erdogan entered the period of shuttle diplomacy.
Once between the two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Mukhin said.
In his opinion, the main task for the Turkish president today is to keep political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States, which with its help control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, the consensus with Turkey will be reached," the expert believes.
Anna Glazova, head of the Center for Asia and the Middle East, takes a different view.
Now Turkey's relations with both the EU and the United States are quite tense, and this is primarily due to the internal policy, which is conducted personally by Erdogan.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reset the policy both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the Turkish president, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, say that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel have been settled, and there is active political cooperation with Iran," Glazova explained to AIF.ru, admitting that Erdogan's next step will be normalization of relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is now pursuing is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept, which was followed by Turkey before the beginning of the Arab revolutions.
"It was then that Turkey began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region very actively in the positions of "zero problems with neighbors".
Now the Turkish President's visits to Russia and African countries have taken place very successful.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey's position both on the regional and international arena," the expert believes.
Glazova believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its former relations with the EU, now the question is whether the EU will start to respond harshly to Turkey, which can go to open the borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Junior doctors' strike: Calls for new collective protests
Representatives of junior doctors have asked the union to sanction new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The Committee of Junior Physicians (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask its full board to support more collective protests since the beginning of September.
JDC said ministers had failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel an employment contract negotiated with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who took part in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC Chairman Helen McCourt said the government had remained "steadfastly silent" about the problems it said led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: "Given the current situation, the head of JDC voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiation on all of your issues."
In response to the government's silence, the head of JDC today made a formal request to an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuous program to expand collective protests starting in early September.
The dispute has led to young doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the BMA's junior doctors, Dr Joan Malawana, has resigned after a vote to repeal the agreed terms of the employment contract recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good deal to be accepted during meetings ahead of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the employment contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Alliance of the Bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the strong impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked taut, and he hardly radiated warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in contrast, has spoken repeatedly about his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia will return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, one newspaper described Mr Erdogan's actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm suggested otherwise.
But the lingering coolness emanating from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that moment was frantic.
Mr Putin erupted in an angry tirade, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger, coming from a supposed friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media have been conducting a stunning, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be considered guilty of everything.
The most serious were accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's own family had cashed in on illegal oil trade from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting only happened because Mr. Putin received an apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim victory of some kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from his post last month in a coup attempt.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast annually.
The number has plummeted by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here, of course, will feel relieved when flights finally resume.
They are putting at the peak end of the season in the Mediterranean.
And even this week state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables once Turkish imports of agricultural products are allowed again.
"Tourists go there, tomatoes back here," as the report in the Newspaper Vedomosti said.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to that her lingering discontent with the pace of talk of joining the EU and the move by Mr Putin - who seeks to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for support for elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Keep in mind, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit at this gleaming palace on the sea coast allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of the bad": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West join forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after almost three hours of initial talks, while the two presidents were giving a press conference, they did not even touch on the topic.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the possibility of a complete catastrophe when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet - it's certainly better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has backed away from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer lending brands.
It has been backed by millions of pounds of sponsorship for international sport, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including external head office and the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that will gain more influence - Coutts, Adam q Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of clients and staff in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be employed because we are now becoming more of a brand bank."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I am saying now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their populations, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup and it is ramping up the profile of various brands in sponsoring the sport.
"This is the right time for us to move the bank brands, since at the heart of (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the executive director.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and would have closed all these brands.
But with the work we've been doing focusing on the needs of our customers rather than on our own, I think you're seeing a lot of changes.
We can bring these brands back, so I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with win at Newmarket at Addiction
Dettori splashes champagne after take at Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track - on the Addiction, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this outstanding mark in smooth races.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Iddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too
I am very glad that it happened in Newmarket, as this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big social event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a normal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm out of business and very unassuming.
Dettori takes a standing ovation as he leads the predisposition after the win
Two jockeys have reached the mark in hurdles: champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has had more than 4,300 career victories.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is not surprising that he reached the point that so few reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical savvy that sets him apart from others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for the races, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he would have led 6,000 winners if it wasn't just a weekend jockey and big races!
And seriously, Frankie has been winning in the UK for the best part of 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for British racing, but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a trademark jump from a horse
From fast finishes to fast-paced jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of Britain's smoothest races for two decades.
It was ups and downs.
Plenty of big-race winners, including his famous "Magnificent Seven" at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified due to doping.
Three years ago he initially ran into difficulties when he returned from a six-month disqualification, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge the naysayers and get back in shape.
And he may not be done for a while - Dettori has previously said he would like to continue competing until at least the age of 50.
Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed environment and transport spokesman.
A statement from the Kremlin said putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but did not give a reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he was the head of the protocol department of the president and the government apparatus, according to the Kremlin's website (in Russian language).
During his appointment, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your work as head of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your guidelines are implemented.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his dismissal and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Do smiles convince you?
This is a move that has puzzled Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters for a long time and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, both men said that the head of the administration had resigned of his own accord.
But despite the smiles on camera, it did not convince many here - especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these unintended consequences of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official announcement - that the man who was once campaigned as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - was met with huge scepticism.
In comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with this very difficult position, even, one might say, a problematic position, for four years.
Well, it turns out I've been head of the president's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB's state security service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term for Putin would be unconstitutional.
However, another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, took the post.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency after just three and a half years.
"Thinking Like a Criminal" star Thomas Gibson fired after brawl with producer
Gibson was involved in a brawl on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences on set and differences of opinion.
I regret that this happened," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be removed from the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to arrive later, according to statements by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Darma and Greg, has been on the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love "Thinking Like a Criminal" and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but now it will be impossible.
I just wanted to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful team, and most importantly, the best fans the show could have dreamed of.
The show is scheduled to return for its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: The fish landed in Banff's garden
A man from Banff appealed for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes 75 fish may have been sandstone left behind by a water tornado.
Bane, who lives 500 metres from the sea, posted a shot of the spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-2-0 fish.
'ueensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The 1.35 billion pound project is now due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the Northern Span and the viaduct of the queensferry Crossing - which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four close-ups between the "canvas fans" that are now coming to an end near all three pylons of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 guys of the bridge.
The 1.35 billion pound project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from ground to bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses to engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project where over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel have become used only for the construction of this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closing between the viaduct and the pavement is a virtuoso operation using extremely precise assembly tolerances.
In total, about 79% of the entire pavement is now in place, for the last section of the canvas concrete coating is cast in Rosyth today, which means that the entire canvas is ready to rise to the place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first time a bridge project is a milestone.
In this amazing project, this combination is the most modern construction art.
After the installation of the last section of the roadway and the connection of it with the expanding roadway of the Northern pylon, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or facing the shore - side.
This was done by pulling up the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres to the south.
It was a large-scale and at the same time very graceful operation.
Large-scale, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be raised at a tilt angle of about 3%.
Elegant, because the tolerances the team was working on were tiny - just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Moelfr Bay rescue: Three men 'lucky to be alive'
Three men 'lucky to be alive' after being thrown from fishing boat in Anglesey
Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after the team saw the incident unfolding in Moelfr Bay.
The three men struggled to reach safety while their vessel continued to move.
"We saw their boat circling beside them and expecting the worst," Moelfre's steering lifeboat driver Vince Jones said.
"Fortunately, by the time we got down to the water, a strong wind had taken it away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while a third man in his 60s was found exhausted and clutched into a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all lifted aboard the coastal lifeboat and taken to the rescue station
Jones said: "The three men thrown into the water were lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had an emergency break-in, but it somehow detached from the man driving the boat when it capsized.
Someone was protecting these guys today.
Pokemon Go, a decent hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and engages in some physical activity.
Screen time was initially limited to TV, then video games and, more recently, smartphones.
It's great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I'm, of course, referring to the craze that is Pokemon Go, an app based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (later spawned a series of cartoons, playing cards and other offshoots).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all this lost its former relevance a little before this new game became available in the U.S., Australia and New York in early July.
The launch in other countries at that time was delayed due to the massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a matter of days, Pok'mon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players with smartphones go looking for Pokemon that are tracked by GPS and, being detected, can be 'photographed' (via a screenshot on your phone) or 'caught'.
The generation that played the game when they were younger joined the craze, breaking away from the sofas to search.
In the U.S., the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps passed by the "ordinary" person daily.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people they tracked who performed 30-minute exercises daily jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokemon Go, it just sees the primary data on the passing levels.
Many health campaigns urging people to "find 30 minutes," "get off the couch" and "be active every day" have not responded because most health messages are boring and are spoken out by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pok'mon Go is that it pulls people out on the street to do what they love.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring nerds who are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might stumble on the door.
So what?
The breakthrough occurred.
After all, despite the fact that smartphone apps such as Fitbit could previously track our physical activity, they did not give us a reason to practice, as this game gives.
The novelty will eat, and the use will weaken with time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Biles wins women's gymnastics gold
Forget the pressure.
Forget the clutter.
Simone Biles is invulnerable to all of this.
Dynamic on the support jump.
At ease on a log.
Stunning on the floor.
Stunning everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the absolute championship title on Thursday, placing the gap between herself and the rest of the world at a convincing demonstration under the scrutiny of the Olympic.
Her total score of 62.198 was at a sufficient distance from the silver medalist and teammate of "Final Five" Eli Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Biles of the United States performs on a gymnastics beam during the final of the women's individual absolute rhythmic gymnastics championship at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the absolute championship title and fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears when her final overall score was revealed and her long journey to this point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare track and field athletes such as Michael Phelps, who have lifted their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the past three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 golds - with such stunning performances in their blend of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test was waiting in Brazil, the competition is not so much between Biles and the rest in this field, as between her and the load of inflated expectations.
Anything less than heading back to his family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an unwarranted wait.
Simone Biles of the United States, left, and Eli Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual absolute rhythmic gymnastics championship at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned her first gold on Tuesday, setting a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of retiring national team coordinator Marta Karolyi.
While Biles insisted she never looked to the future during her long journey to the top, that's not exactly true.
Part of her freestyle exercise program - one that includes her signature pass - is set on Latin music that would fit right up at home on the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents as a beginner and discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman during a visit to the hall where Boorman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn't lost a single competition since the summer of 2013 - a streak of luck that should last as long as Biles wants.
Despite the fact that Mustafina gained a slight advantage with two spins, it was a mirage.
Gymnastic logs and freestyle exercises - where Biles defends the world title - lie in wait.
She came out ahead again with 15,433 on the beam and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman gently hugged her as they waited for the final bill - a pure formality - and tears appeared around a shiny red and blue Biles eyeliner when the idea she once recorded on the clipping album came true.
Raisman's performance was a little revenge for what happened four years ago, when she shared third place, but lost bronze to Mustafina in the tiebreak.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "grandma" was much ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her freestyle exercise-ridden comeback, which sometimes seemed in question.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from the beginning of this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot dead while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in the Phoenix first serial killer in a decade were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot June 12 when their car was parked on the roadway, authorities said.
The offender fired about eight shots from the gun while standing on the passenger side of the vehicle before fleeing in another vehicle, the report said.
Police say the triple homicide did not appear to be the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the wallets or $2,900 that were in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to check whether he was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latino areas over a four-month period.
"It's happening in the residential area in front of the house," Howard told KPHO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles including a brown Nissan of the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to reveal evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked to the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died at the scene.
The witness told police that it was not unusual that they were sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple homicide, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found casings and removed a bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: 'Getting better'
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Pixivto, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do that.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign up for it.
Which is not really true - of course you subscribe to it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even offered to place him in a specialized medical facility.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing that anymore,"" Pisivto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't speak.
But it is slowly going through some stages.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows a gesture that Edmund came up with for "please sing me."
"We teach him sign language," Pixivto told CBS News.
But not just the usual sign language - she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different factors: genetic infections such as Edmund's during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It is too early to say how this will affect the lives of those who are infected with the virus.
Pixivto recalls the emotional toll of an uncertain future.
Did I keep saying what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I haven't actually asked for a prediction for life because I don't expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Pixivto has reassuring advice for mothers of children with birth defects due to zika.
It's getting better.
You know everything's going to get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding trigger rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected over the state through Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have overflowed and threatened widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid has already gone to affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said there were requests for transportation for high water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tanjipahoa's parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The danger of flooding remains in place until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The Met Office said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches could thubly across the area.
In southern Alabama, flood-watching remained in place until Friday as rain continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comit River near Baton Rouge and the Eimit River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were forecast to set a record for flooding levels over the weekend.
Forecaster Alec Krautmann said both rivers could have flooded many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that flooding going downstream in the parish of Assenshen is a threat, as these swollen rivers will slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest ever recorded level at 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of floodwaters in Aimit and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued early on Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, said the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, quickly rose overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.
"We woke up and the water kept coming," Hansford said.
It reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford it was the biggest influx she'd seen in the 48 years she'd lived here.
Hansford said he and all members of his family have a disability and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they took cover on Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding is "spreading rapidly" as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann said one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been oversaturated with rain since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of streets have led to efforts to rescue residents from homes in Tanjipahoa Parish and cancel classes in five school districts, authorities said.
WWL, a CBS affiliate, reports that Tangipahoa's councillor reported about 200 flooded homes.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but they are both now flooded.
Ward chairman Robbie Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped in high water.
Shelters have been opened in the city of Aimee and the city of Hammond to welcome those who have been evacuated.
"They will be able to go home as soon as the water starts to recede," he said.
In the town of Hammond, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," city manager Lacey Landrum said.
It's on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, Emergency Services Chief Rupert Lacey said heavy rain continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
He said several homes were reported as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Toson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Aimee, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Tauson said, "and she's still pouring on the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, 'riddled with bullets', remains alive after shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia while registering a second shooting at a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to a hospital.
"He was very lucky, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in hospital in a critical condition and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is said to be in critical condition; Two other victims were reported in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the injured men may have been the shooter.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shootout between several armed men.
The casings of semi-automatic weapons, attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons, covered the scene.
It seems like it's definitely been a long battle.
There were shell casings on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were several armed fighters there and they were actively involved in the firefight," Philadelphia Police Capt. Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Many houses and cars in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing CCTV cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was struck in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She is recovering and police are still searching for the suspect.
Why we need Simon, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team and for several reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And the second: three gymnasts play a key role in this team: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The line-up of this team, supplemented by Eli Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, at last, like America.
It has also strengthened black and Latino women's presence at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American woman.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were No.1 and No.2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America cheered approvingly.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez performing unexpected, but nevertheless virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women's individual absolute championship.
And teammate Eli Raisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it does not look so in gymnastics sections across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Eli and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the "final five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of The Coaching of Marta Karoly.
But in reality gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastic clubs, supported by parents, paying for training, equipment, travel, uniforms, fees for participation in competitions, payment of hotel services (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their training, and this is an expensive and long-term duty for the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Honey, coach Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they took up gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable and affordable gymnastics training to communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and low-cost gymnastics classes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (mostly blacks and Latinos) and have nurtured national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to grueling work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive effect on good health, school success and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and that's fine.
Doing sports is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Eli, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of "Women's Power" in winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors set to announce further strikes after Jeremy Hunt's proposal rejected
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing amended contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to introduce the contract, saying the NHS was on "no-go ground" and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract that includes changes to work at night and weekends to improve after-hours care.
Dr Helen McCote, chair of the BMA's Young Physicians Committee, said last night in a statement: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks to go before the first group of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The WMA's attempt to resolve the dispute with negotiations was met with reluctance to take action and sometimes complete silence on the part of the Government.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he fails to do so, then junior doctors are unequivocal in that they are ready to stage subsequent strikes.
The latest strike at the end of April delayed about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurse appointments, while nurses and consultants were brought in to ensure replacement doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing a modified contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
The VMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who will fall under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: "Strikes reach little or nothing, but put pressure on teams and services already working at the limit, and cause anxiety, physical pain and distress to patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Junior Physicians Committee and together with the Department of Health and others to respond positively to their concerns about the role of carers and corporate awareness policies.
Workers hoped that continued positive support on other important topics - such as staff allocation, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after a career break, tuition fees, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differences in medicine - were a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about to comply with the conditions achieved by the VMA in November, February and May.
The drug for 2 euros a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are going to use the drug for 2 degrees a day, after the authorities recommended giving it to more people and for a longer time.
The anti-clotting drug tikagrelor reduces the risk of repeated attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or a new attack.
The NICE oversight service of the UK National Health Service has advised people to give it for four years to prevent the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE nhs watchdog has now advised people to give it for four years to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs to around 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque is torn apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it will be able to move through the blood flow and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already been caught up in one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Tikagrelor, manufactured by the British firm Astra'eneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making blood clots less likely.
The NICE draft instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90mg of tikagrelor for 12 months, then 60mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite having effective secondary prevention methods, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
There is evidence that tikagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective at reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
By recommending tikagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of tikagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
PC ownership culture allows vote rigging to flourish in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was suspended last year over corruption allegations
A culture of political correctness has led to a close eye, which has resulted in widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities, according to a devastating government report released today.
Former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles has criticised police, election watchers and city officials for ignoring evidence of election irregularities because of "excessive sensitivity about race and religion."
The former communities secretary, now an anti-corruption tsar, said the sectarian intimidation was so strong that police should be allowed to put up cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He proposes that voters take ID cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters should only give their name and address.
The report even suggests that indelible ink is applied to people's fingers when they cast their ballots, with the aim of eliminating someone from voting twice.
Better protection should be provided to whistleblowers, Sir Eric said.
He called for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street in the wake of the vote scandal at Tower Hamlets in east London.
Last year, a special court considering elections ruled that incumbent Mayor Luftur Rahman should have been removed from office because of a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "led his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were questionable or were the result of personification when a person votes by posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concerns about postal voting fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, pictured, has made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your ID to prove who you are
Its report said: "Evidence has been presented of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote at the will of the elders, particularly in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There were fears that... States have turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of the oversensitivity of "political correctness" about ethnicity and religion."
Cheese Eric has made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including removing political activists from working with postal ballot papers to stop "collecting votes."
The report, before Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the use of the electoral roll for immigration fraud and privilege.
The option of requiring voters to show an identity card before voting is considered.
Use indelible ink on people's fingers as soon as they cast their ballot to prevent someone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on people's nationality to make sure they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal voting.
Remove political campaigners and activists from working with absentee ballots and postal ballot envelopes.
Give the police the power to set up cordons around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation under the People's Act 1983.
Make it illegal to photograph at polling stations.
Make a requirement that only English is used at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff forces voters to go to the booth one at a time.
Sir Eric is furiously attacking the city police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been brought following the Tower Hamlets case.
"The court considering the election disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal actions," he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of a reasonable doubt - the criminal standard of proof - on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes inconclusive "check for the sake of ticking" the electoral registration departments of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Crazy by Kate's cycling counterpart and other celebrity lookalikes at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week went crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevo, who appeared to look impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old is far from the only athlete vying for gold this summer, who boasts her own famous lookalike - at least according to reports on social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: U.S. archers men's team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
Aside from Kate's lookalike on the bike path, many people online rushed to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. Archers men's team member Brady Ellison caused the storm on Twitter after images emerged of him looking frighteningly like the Wolf of Wall street star.
And in fact, Archer learned about the madness of social media and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
"I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe except for the vegetation on my face," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt point even further this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big expressive eyes, is said to be an exact replica of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a 'sporting version' of the actor's 'Beginnings'
Another long-ongoing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who boast similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist swimmer from Russia Yulia Efimova boasts not only equally tanned skin and blond hair as actress AnnaLynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from Team USA, according to fans, looks like "a sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt."
Harsh women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, right, have the same face and eye shapes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this pair
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to make public her delight that "the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
In fact, U.S. soccer star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautiful broad smile that looks like a smile from "Success" star Gabrielle Union.
Olympics commentator on CBC apologises for speaking out about Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of fourth place at the finish line of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged CBC viewers on Wednesday in a live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started out like a stink" and "died like a pig" during a swim.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started expressing his own opinion at the end of the women's 4200m freestyle relay final.
One could hear McDonald, who was drawn to a CBC commentary team to "dilute it with color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, started out like a stink, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, who is 14, swam the second stage of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing the Canadians to eliminate the gap from China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and expressions they used
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC announcer just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig' ????'
This idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby."
Criticism on Twitter immediately fell on Byron McDonald, with many calling for his sacking
Twitter users couldn't resist hearing how insensitive Byron McDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for McDonald's comment, saying, 'We ask for forgiveness for the comment about the swimming performance being aired.'
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
The IFOR ended up apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to the statement
Commentator Scott Russell's friend had to apologise on behalf of McDonald
The CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
The TV network also hastened to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to go on the air.
Last night we acted promptly to apologize to our viewers live and our subscribers in social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not her as an individual.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized on live television and tried to clarify his comment, saying he didn't think his words would be interpreted as an attack on the individual.
'I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympics broadcast.
'I was talking about the swimmer's performance, not her personally.'
'It goes without saying that there was no disrespect and I'm sorry.'
Primark shopper insulted woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of shop
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped naked to try on her panties on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, she tried on what she looked like in them, pulled them off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone where a woman tried on knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf
Mother-of-two Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said the mystery woman "got dressed again and left the store without buying anything" after fitting her underwear.
She said: "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the shopping hall, she took a pair of panties from the window, took off her own tights and underpants and put them on.
'She didn't try to find a secluded place to do it - she was just standing there, shameless.'
'Everyone was staring when she took off her panties again and she clearly didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'
She did the same thing to three other couples before finally deciding that there was nothing here that she liked, dressed again and went out.
'It doesn't look like she cared who was watching her or what she thought of the man who ended up buying those underpants she was trying on.'
Jenny Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone is going to take home the underpants that someone else has already worn and they haven't been washed.'
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items from sale after she left - and all the better."
'I wouldn't want to come home with a new pair of women's underpants and find that another woman put them on and took them off and they weren't washed.'
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is aware of an incident that happened at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday 9 August."
All the goods in question were withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself from attacks with a gun using Krav Maga
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Mizdry, Master of the Krav Mag Federation in New York, to figure out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether coming up to you from the front or behind, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapon.
If you're coming from behind, according to Misthara, the first thing to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and 'release the line of fire'.
Then you tightly squeeze the gun between your forearm and shoulder, before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then follows the knee in the groin, and while the attacker bends in pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with the barrel and step back, holding the weapon pointed at him.
For the armed, suitable in front, the way of execution is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and twist it so that the villain could not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip, before stepping back and aiming at him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Misceri does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any robbery - if you're not a Master of Krav Magician - is to give away your cash.
For a guidebook, traveller Ian Wright guides his tongue through Europe's dirtiest places
A British traveller has put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test, licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Travel presenter ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, spent the language on the euro banknote, the Peekcadili Circus railings, the toilet button on the train and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what it fits into.
But the experiment, which is to become a film called "The Guide to the Traveller-Lizun on the Inner Power", gave some amazing results.
The thought of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of others can be extremely disgusting, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout the trip across Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and health workers about the increase in gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the licked did not bring him more than bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for his gut strength tests, traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public railings at train stations to toilet flush buttons, this task has undoubtedly tested his immune system
In the film he filmed, he said: 'Since I was a kid I've been completely carefree with my health and I've been pulling a lot of different things in my mouth out of the ground, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test smear showed a luminometer value of more than 4,000 units.
By comparison: freshly washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet, which he refused to lick, after the value of his luminometer was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands show less than 60
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have made a film about a traveler called "The Traveller-Lizun's Guide to the Inner Force" which demonstrates the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the toilet
In the film, he said, 'It's close to one of the worst things I've sniffed in the toilet.'
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
"The Guide of the Traveller-Lizun on the Inner Force" was filmed together with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains fermented milk bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Valio Senior Vice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Nico Vuorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorming session that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about foods, we wanted to put them in more context: the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is related to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let's just say I would have lost respect for Jan if he had licked some of the things I asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.'
Naturally, some things jan was easier to lick, and some were pretty tough.
I'm glad that we were able to film some of these licks.'
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents linked fermented milk bacteria solely to good stomach and bowel condition, while 58 percent said they consumed, at least occasionally, foods containing added fermented milk bacteria.
Hooligan family destroys Saltash, Cornwall council house, on eve of eviction
A family of hooligans has left their municipal home with a loss of 50,000 euros after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcok were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked officials of housing and construction cooperatives found the property in a state requiring repair.
Walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were opened, debris was scattered on the floor and walls were stained with graffiti.
The family has now been resettled and is believed to be living in a private apartment
Donna McEvoy, a settler at Cornwall Housing, said she feared he would not be saved.
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people here and I don't think people should live like that.
There are a lot of things that need to be weighed up because this property is likely to be known as the not-so-good aspect of Cornwall.
This family is notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple have three sons who have lived in the property from time to time, and police say the horror caused by the family included brawls in the street with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive shouting, arguments and expletives.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for anti-social behaviour in June.
In several rooms of the house, which could be demolished, found old garbage
The floor boards in the house where drugs were sold in the past were pulled out
Neighbours say they saw fights in the street and regularly called police
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner's home this week after they were given an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The eviction was greeted with relief by neighbours who said their lives had been turned into a living hell.
One said: 'They didn't care about anyone.'
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
'We couldn't sleep this morning.'
We got up because it was so quiet - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything's going to be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of neighbourhood management group Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to co-operate with local authorities.
The family had lived in the house for 20 years, with police, and were regularly called by police
Debris and old toys were scattered below the overgrown side of the council house
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant has not been able to take any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family, as eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been horrific for her watching neighbours.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have bravely come forward to give us information.
I hope that this development will give a little comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all in their 20s at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove piles of rubbish that surrounds the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as scales, matching supplies and 1,700 euros in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs with intent to supply.
She said the money went to pay for a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were made homeless, it is reported that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the house's rooms were stained with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they will try to evict tenants who do not comply with premises rental rules
Angela Crowe, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
'This is a message to those who feel they can behave without the prosecutor's charges, as well as those who are harmed by this behavior,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane nearly touched a beach
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to soak up the sun, scared for their lives
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft flew incredibly low
The Air Force said it was on a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk
That's the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low-flying plane si%.2000 away.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane flying almost within touching distance of hunters on a strip of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Holidaymakers jumped to their feet as soon as they became understandably concerned about the noise of the plane's engines, but unable to see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident took place last night near the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted a video of the shocking flyby on social media, said: "He flew quite low twice and there was a moment at one point it seemed like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I swear it felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach were terrified when the plane appeared out of the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude
Portugal's Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast, and was forced to descend so low as it was the only way to check them.
The pilot stated that the plane was flying slightly lower than usual due to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the Air Force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the Portuguese mainland and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force issued a statement today saying that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances - thick fog and smog from forest fires that worsened visibility
The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was tasked with detecting the fishing boats as part of the mission
The HASSP system has been mandatory for catering for more than a year, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Checks are becoming more active, and businesses face fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of HASSP) - risk analysis and critical checkpoints - is mandatory for use by food producers and carriers, as well as catering companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CU).
Checks of the business by Rospotrebnadzor for compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials issue fines only for individual violations of the regulations (see "List of documents" ...).
Failure to comply with the regulations as a whole will cost the company 600,000 rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles - for the second.
HASSP, a system that takes into account and prevents food risks, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
Then it was about the safety of food for astronauts.
Now the system is used in all food enterprises not only in the U.S., but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating on the territory of the CU.
The business had 4 years to develop and implement the system (the HASSP requirement appeared in the technical regulations of the TS in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard about this rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been sure that the norm applies only to food productions, not restaurateurs, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone is trying to catch up.
The expected resumption of charter flights to Turkey is late August and early September.
But they will not cause a rush of demand, as their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts say.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies yesterday sent a letter to the government asking to allow charters.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of the selection of high-quality and affordable sea holidays is insoluble, as in the resorts of krasnodar region and the Republic of Crimea, most accommodation facilities are already booked before the end of September," the authors of the letter note and emphasize that the opening of charter flights in August will not significantly affect the already established demand for Russian maritime tourism products.
As reported in the North-West Regional Branch of the Russian Union of Travel Industry (RST), if the aviation agencies of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
There is no clear understanding of when charters will be resumed, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even August, if tour operators quickly build programs and agree with airlines on the necessary boards," said Pavel Rumyantsev, deputy director of communications and international projects of the Northwest Regional Office of the PCT.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but will not have too much impact on the balance of power in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or are spending vacations in other countries.
In the velvet season buy tours mostly single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously," pavel Rumyantsev said.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists, if it now gives very budget offers - 50-60 thousand rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are purposefully waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, CEO of the travel agency Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it is not worth counting on the hype - the bulk of travel has already been planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that as there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but the hype should not wait.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for the next season," Pavel Rumyantsev said.
"The opening of charters to Turkey is positive news for the next season," Valeria Rubtsova agrees.
The tax code provides for exemption from the NDFL established by the law of compensation payments within the approved rules related to the compensation of harm caused by injury or other damage to health.
The issuance of milk to employees employed in work with harmful working conditions is provided by Article 222 of the Russian Federation.
At the same time, the rules and conditions of issuance are set by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia on 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
According to the document, the free issuance of milk or other equivalent food is given to employees on days of actual employment in work conditions with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful industrial factors in the workplace.
Based on these rules, the Russian Federal Tax Service in the letter under consideration concluded that it was based on abs. 2 p. 3 p. 217 NK of the Russian Federation exempt from taxation of NDFL income in the form of the value of milk, issued to employees on days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Rules and conditions approved by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
Moscow's Gazstroybank was left without a Central Bank license.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to carry out banking operations from the credit organization Shareholder Commercial Bank "GazstroyBANK" registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, GazstroyBANK had a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank's assets led to the credit organization's grounds for implementing measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in dubious transit operations.
The bank has appointed an interim administration valid until the appointment of a competitive manager or liquidator.
The executive powers of the credit organization are suspended in accordance with federal laws.
Gazstroybank is a member of the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance compensation to depositors of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with the Federal Law No. 177-Fz "On the insurance of deposits of individuals in the banks of the Russian Federation" is provided in the amount of 100% of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million rubles in total per depositor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will begin no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the reporting data, as of August 1, 2016, GazstroyBANK was ranked 335th in the Russian banking system.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunji said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have been killed by a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only advantage of this whole thing - like a tombstone and a testament to others, is that these are the risks that are at stake when going to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making the same choice," Akunji said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family said she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow within months.
Reid says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he's confident Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland's confirmation, the way President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the man who can replace the last Supreme Court justice, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a conference call Thursday that he predicts clinton will choose Garland "with some degree of confidence."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and was simply making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are "henchmen" and "associates" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was unfit for office.
Treats claims erotic calendars are for 'women as well as for men'
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellmer to release a calendar for 2017 inspired by the Pirelli of the 1970s.
But instead of nude celebrities, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with nude muses.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I make it for women.
Obviously he thinks the calendar too.
"We need to go back to showcasing an eternal and classic nude figure where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at public castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Muscovites will be given memos about unscrupulous online stores.
Moscow is going to release a memo that will tell how not to become a victim of the online store.
This was reported in Rospotrebnadzor, M24 writes.
It is reported that the department's specialists are preparing a memo that will help citizens choose the right online store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure provides several sections.
It will be general information and legislative framework, rules of delivery of goods, ways to protect their legal rights.
The application will give recommendations on how to make a claim correctly and so on," Rospotrebnadzor said.
The memo is currently being finalized.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow, it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute to Muscovites.
The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement in which it named the second suspect in the organization of sabotage in Crimea.
Persons from among the citizens of Ukraine and Russia, who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts, were detained.
Among them - Panov Evgeny Aleksandrovich and Andrei Romanovich.
"All of them give confessions," the statement said.
Earlier, Yevgeny Panov, a resident of the region, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, pleaded guilty during the interrogation.
FAS will fine Google 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antitrust Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google Corporation in the amount of 438 million rubles, according to the agency's website.
"The fine for Google for violation of antitrust laws was 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will implement our decision and pay the fine in the near future," said FAS deputy head Alexei Dotsenko.
During the investigation, the FAS found that Google supplies smartphone manufacturers, which are sold in Russia, the google Play app store only on condition that the device will be installed and other applications of the corporation.
Among these applications is a search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates Section 1 of Article 10 "On the Protection of Competition" (abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the order will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The Law on Protection of Competition must be respected by all companies whose products are shipped to the territory of the Russian Federation, and to multinational corporations, among other things," said the head of the Communications and Information Technology Regulation Office of the FAS of Russia, Elena Saeva.
The agency suspects of collusion of 16 Russian stores.
The New Book Network was fined for selling the book "50 Days Before My Suicide."
The New Book chain has been fined for selling Stace Kramer's book "50 days before my suicide," according to the Moscow City News Agency.
As reported in Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as "provoking or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents."
The Ostankin district court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products to children and decided to impose a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of printed products seized by the Rospotrebnadzor department.
A source at New Book confirmed that it was a work by Stais Kramer.
In March this year, it was reported that the largest bookstores in Moscow are being checked for the book "50 days before my suicide."
An evening of remembrance of Ernst the Unknown will be held in Moscow.
An evening of remembrance of sculptor Ernst the Unknown will be held in Moscow, TASS reports.
The event will take place on August 15 in the Central House of Writers.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the U.S. in person.
Therefore, it was decided to arrange this evening for those who want to remember it on their native land," the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress said.
They noted that this is important for the widow of sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of the Unknown, including poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, artist Boris Messerer, President of the Pushkin Institute Irina Antonova, director Mark Rozovsky, as well as Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Moscow Department of Culture Alexander Kibovsky, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pechatnikov were invited to the evening.
Earlier it was reported that relatives of Ernst the Unknown plan to hold a memorial service for the sculptor in New York, presumably until August 14.
End-user vinyl: who actually buys records?
Single middle-aged men love vinyl.
And while you didn't rush to clog up the comments section with rude insults under the pseudonym Not All-Guys2Oms2stlet, this statement stems from the evidence.
According to YouGov, so much of the filmed revival of records is due not to the boom among the generation of two thousand, who want to imbue with the novelty of the material subject, but nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
It's also not just an act of gathering amateurs - it has an emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%). and enjoy loneliness (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog was a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street, in a modest gray suit and gesticulating violently before stopping, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, "So, let's see."
So, let's see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and filth - hotels, cafes, Paperchase shops are now flooded with buildings once occupied by independent vendors - a few music stores with fantastic experts are still there.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene in which I find myself close to various people in some of these stores and try to gauge their age and emotional mood through observation.
Glasgow-born Stuart, 55, who went from Sister Ray (counting data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counting data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably over 20), in London for half a day to hold a meeting, and strolls around the shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
"I suppose so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me a snapshot, I didn't chase him home), go lines along the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles is partly from his disposable income: he can now buy records that he could not afford when they first came out, and buy back items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of what I'm buying is the late '60s, early '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
That's my fault.
Weez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets fit the YouGov profile.
He noticed, however, a new wave of people influenced by the hype in the media, people who heard about the return and felt the obligation to buy out their old records.
Judging by the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records," he says.
This may explain the boom among vinyl revival figures of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of records?
It is enough to spend a few seconds in a store such as Phonica to understand that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Weiz, some older customers, in particular, are offended by the non-cash payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel the shock of the digital world and prefer to retire to the permanence of familiar envelopes for records, objects that evoke memories of serene youth.
"I think sometimes it can be filling the void or owning material things as a kind of calm," says Weez.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people do, too.
It's an easy way to occupy your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the plate rack.
An ICM poll in April found that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously puzzled, flicking through the rack with Bosanowa's collections.
The "trophy" aspect of the revival is what Johnny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, noticed.
"Someone came in recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on my shelf,"" he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely does.
More component of the piece, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not the elderly, they are a little less than twenty, who are just getting to know it.
Fopp, who has now taken almost the entire floor to vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - the latest synth- and sexy-pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation, breaks through the speakers - it's nice to see the diversity in its customers.
None of them looks particularly lonely, but the excruciating psychological trauma is difficult to establish standing up for 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleanor, 27, walked on Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records on sale.
She looks at the goods, not spends money.
She doesn't earn much, she said, so collecting records isn't a good option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device - simple, but the beauty of vinyl - it is ..." - she plunges into dreams with a sigh of love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban fashionistas.
While I'm creating the illusion that I'm looking at denim tight-fitting shorts, I watch a group of teenage girls gather around the Polaroid camera every minute before the father and his daughter start discussing buying a Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase with adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mack: a mixture of modern style and classics, must-have records for any medium collection.
No one is looking - perhaps because they are just decorations, some are located so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "artistic vinyl."
But given that any attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the Soho hinterland for another while, there's almost nothing to complain about.
Not surprisingly, a segment of the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the layer that spends most of the money on luxury goods such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they do not exclude the existence of the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers who exist in reality, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or offices.
But they clearly don't spend Thursday morning strolling through the record shops on Berwick Street, flicking through records and avoiding the gaze of the nasty 30-year-old fake presenter who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland polar shark - longest-lived vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that the Greenland polar shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, says the record was set by a female aged between 272 and 512 years and five metres long
French court rejects proposal to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or simple dishes for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Prefecture of Calais has said that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they carry fire and sanitary risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing population in the camp.
They said that home-made shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those who need it.
A Lille court ruled there was no legitimate reason to expel people running 72 makeshift shops, but said the problems of Calais prefecture "were fully understood."
Judge Jean-Francois Molla said groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely shaky conditions."
He said the spaces provided quiet meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened with demolition was the Jungle Book children's cafe at the camp, which works not for profit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes and counselling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are under the age of eight."
Two charities, Refugee Aid and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp had grown to more than 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a surge in arrivals over the summer.
Libraries of neighborhoods invite young free people to educational programs.
This week, the library-branches will hold meetings dedicated to the City Day, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the Physical Education.
Programs are aimed at children's audience, so most of them will be held in a playful way.
Today, August 10, the library-branch No. 2, in the district, invites to a cruise presentation "My town is small."
On August 11, the library-branch No. 1 will host the local history hour "I live in this city, I know this city."
A multimedia lesson "Earth of native past fate" will be held in the library-branch No. 2 on the same day.
And in the library-branch number 4 in Surazhevka - game program "Film, film, film."
On Sunday, August 14, for the children from the northern neighborhood, the library-branch No. 3 will hold a game program "Fizcult-hello!".
Britain stops for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass allows them to take gold
Great Britain's impressive series in Rugby Sevens was crushingly halted at the final hurdles by a Fijian team in the final on Thursday night when they were completely crushed 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji were given a masterclass in ball possession, scake, evasion, game support, running lines and brute force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat came with a not-too-poor consolation in the form of silverware - Britain's third in a day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic Rugby Sevens tournament, which defeated New ealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The painful beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier in the day, could return to negatively affect them in the final.
But no matter what, Fiji beat a 15-man team in this form.
It may be some consolation for Britain - but probably not - that at least one Briton will hang up the gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
This has been some travel for the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
These blows will cause pain, but the progress is astounding.
Fiji started superbly, for fun kicking off Britain's attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Colinisau dived into the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Gerrard Tooway added another touchdown on the right flank that was implemented.
12-0 and Great Britain barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's superb interception attempt kept man-mountain Leon Nakarawa from scoring the third, but that only held fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner and Great Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another after the resumption and on the clock still had more than a minute ... in the first half.
Saddamo then broke through several more sluggish interception attempts by Great Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
The realization led to 29-0 at halftime.
It looked as though Fiji were born to play rugby sevens, while Great Britain is still mastering the craft.
Which is pretty much true.
Great Britain made massive substitutions at half-time and they clogged the Fijian dam... For all four minutes, which by the standards of the first half was good until Joshua Tuisova passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for Great Britain by making a touchdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game had long followed the path of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was impossible not to admire the joyful approach of Fiji.
Mata William embellished a Fijian cake that didn't need embellishment, with another try in the final seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in their semi-final, while Great Britain beat South Africa in a tense semi-final with one try each - the difference of the British.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with some superb footwork and scored under the beams in the second half.
A brilliant last-half interception attempt from Marcus Watson, the brother of England's 15th-team side, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to win rowing trainer's battle with cancer
There will be no more exciting gold at these games, and that says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy climbs in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the added value of their golden moment at estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of trainer Robin Williams was always there while they sought a second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sport to get to such heights.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we see is two brilliant female athletes, sliding on the surface with the elegance of swans, do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold rowing battalion of ready-made hands, contributing to the gradually escalating victories that are important, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of a trainer who, 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know whether he would live to see the day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the that they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, it goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your views for the future a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio are lucky he could start treatment in early 2014 in the off-season, keeping the gap schedule minimal if that might be the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed payment, so I needed to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walking around the department -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, though they said it was quite a few steps.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
The moments after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who had a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, captain of the Artillery Regiment with a service in Afghanistan behind her shoulders, said, "I was emotionally wrecked this week, maybe it's a little too much, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much I and Helen have worked, and Robin too.
It's been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank you very much to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams of New York and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much to spare.
We were in a phase.
Helen called: 'Stay in the process, stay in the process.'
Now it is very important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't try to do something amazing.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just waiting to be able to row well and come out and win this race, which we did.
It's going to take the couple a year to decide their future.
Glover is due to be at a wedding next month, on her own with TV adventurer Steve Bacshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I had become an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
Government extends period for destruction of sanctions products
The government has extended until the end of 2017 the period of destruction of food prohibited for import into Russia.
The relevant resolution was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it is published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo against the countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was imposed in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban was repeatedly extended, now it is valid until December 31, 2017.
Some agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein are prohibited from entering Russia.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
Recycling of food imported into the country bypassing the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were withdrawn from sale.
Hunting for "prohibition"

The WTO arbitrator panel found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the organization's rules.
The import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia when it joined the WTO.
"This is the first time that the WTO has taken a decision against Russia," the organization said in a statement on its official website.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures "were systematic" or "comprehensive."
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the statement of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which has imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times reported that U.S. behavior in resolving wto disputes undermines the organization's principles of discussion.
Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members made a similar statement because of the Refusal of the Americans to approve South Korean judge Jang Song Hwa for a second term.
In this regard, Russia will not apply to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed on Russia.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now comprises 162 countries.
Russia joined in 2012.
In the presidential administration, the head of the
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed Anton Vaino, former deputy of Sergei Ivanov, as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin has reshuffled the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In his turn, Anton Vaino said during the meeting that he considers the anti-corruption work that he began to carry out as the head of the presidential administration of Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier," Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable and the reshuffle will not fundamentally change the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head, who has been working in the presidential administration for quite a long time, has left, effectively built the activities of the AP.
He was replaced by Anton Vaino, the deputy head of the administration, a man who knows the specifics of the job.
Poland admits that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
State-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years gas supplies from Russia may become unattractive for it due to reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was announced by the vice-president of the Polish finance company Bohuslav Majec.
His words are reported by TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas (from Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supply destinations for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway," Majetz said.
Gazprom currently dominates gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas in the first half of 2016, which is 30% higher than in 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG purchases rose to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
On July 22, Poland's antitrust agency did not agree on the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners to build the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline.
At the same time, a month earlier, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters of gas under Nord Stream-2.
This was stated by the deputy chairman of the board of the holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the capacity of "Northern Stream-2" will take place in 2017, and in autumn 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its laying.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom does not plan to take any action in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for gas supply from Russia after 2022, said Deputy Chairman of the Board alexander Medvedev.
He reminded that in the first quarter of this year, Poles only increased gas purchases from Russia by 42%.
Gazprom's deputy chairman added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG filed an application to the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not mean the termination of negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court to reduce the purchase price of Russian gas.
Recall, the Polish government's commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure Peter Naimski said that the Polish authorities have decided not to renew the contract with Gazprom for gas supply.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish government's commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, Piotr Naimski, said his country could stop supplying blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream-2 envisages the construction of two strands of offshore gas pipeline with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany along the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine's border with Crimea.
This was announced by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine, Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, answering a question from journalists, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, there are no incidents affecting security.
Observers monitored what was happening at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of the Yak-42 passenger plane landing at Ufa airport appeared on the Internet, which rolled out of the runway at 400 m and fell on the left wing.
The video was published by TV channel "360."
The accident happened at 4.30 Moscow time.
The KrasAvia flight arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to safety and there were no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport is operating as usual.
The Volga Investigative Directorate on transport of the SKR began to find out the reason for the hard landing of the airliner.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
A U.N. special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN special envoy for Syria Steffan de Mistura considers the fact of the incident undeniable.
Similar statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian talks, which are due to begin in Geneva at the end of August.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the attack using toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
At the time, the opposition said that in the area where the Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before, the aircraft dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow these accusations were called a throw-in.
Later, the Russian Defense Ministry blamed the opposition group Haraqyat Noor al-Din al-Sinki for the incident.
It soon became known that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
One of the victims confirmed to the BBC.
"A few minutes later I smelled gas, started burning my eyes, it became difficult to breathe," the newspaper quoted an eyewitness as saying.
At least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalized as a result of the attack.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be considered a war crime.
The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters: "There is a lot of evidence that this actually happened."
The use of chlorine for military purposes is spelled out in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CSO).
Despite the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights activists recorded 35 cases of chlorine use by the Syrian army against the "moderate opposition".
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that shelling of its areas is carried out daily, and terrorists are preventing the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to establish a "humanitarian pause" in military actions.
The organization's current three-hour lull is considered "insufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped."
Staffan de Mistura's humanitarian adviser, Jan Egeland, said a 48-hour ceasefire would be needed each week to bring aid to the city and evacuate the sick and wounded.
"We have to send bulk cargoes with a convoy of trucks in an area where the roads are almost destroyed and those that remain are mined," Mr. Egeland said. "But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit down with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a "humanitarian pause" are continuing.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
Amid the ongoing battle for Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, Russia on August 11 announced a three-hour cessation of hostilities that will be in effect daily starting Thursday.
The establishment of "humanitarian windows" is designed to ensure that medicines, food and basic necessities are delivered to the city.
The decision of the Russian Defense Ministry was taken against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with a demand to cancel the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
Four people have been killed in a series of explosions in Thai resorts.
Several explosions occurred in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed and 19 wounded in the attack.
The epicenter of the explosions hit the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, Russians are not among them.
No terrorist group has yet claimed responsibility for the incident, but the country's Interior Ministry hastened to say that Islamists were not involved.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of organizing the bombings.
According to preliminary data of the local police, the scale and features of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military leaders of the country.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts including Patong Beach in The Phuket area and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
Since the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth has fallen from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism has remained one of the few industries that have demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people visited the country, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of attacks have already been detained, police Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen said.
It is too early to talk about the goals, he added, but the country's Interior Ministry "is confident that they are not connected to international extremist groups."
It is too early to draw conclusions," Mr. Patanacharoen said. -
But we do know that these incidents are not directly related to any type of terrorism, in fact they are local sabotage, and we are trying to identify those behind them.
The explosions took place on the birthday of Thailand's queen Sikrit.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely directed against it.
According to police general Sithiicha Srisopachcharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on busy streets filled with tourists dining in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl selling street food.
The identities of the other victims are not yet known, but they are known to be residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, they include four German nationals, three Dutch nationals, two Italian nationals and an Austrian national.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the press service of Rosturism said.
Local experts also attribute the bombings to the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country's population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitutional commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role in electing the country's prime minister.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time in the parliamentary elections of 2017.
Recall, on May 22, 2014 in Thailand there was a military coup under the leadership of the commander of the army of the country Prayuth Chan-ocha.
The move, he said, was prompted by an ongoing political crisis and a lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council of Peace and Order, imposed curfews and censorship, dispersed protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces surrounding the capital in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
How two explosions occurred in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred near the Victory Monument in central Bangkok, where one of the main protests took place, injuring 28 people, five of them in critical condition.
Explosions were carried out by unknown people on motorcycles.
The authorities have stepped up security measures in the capital and enlisted military forces to protect the demonstrators.
Conditions have been developed in dry Log.
As it became known to "Y", the government was asked to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the gold mine Sukhoi Logue with the preservation of two key restrictions.
It is proposed not to allow companies where 25% or more belongs to foreigners, and those applicants, whose capital will not be at least 25% of state participation.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August, and held - in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources has submitted to the government a draft order and the terms of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia, Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), said two sources familiar with the situation.
The draft was introduced on Wednesday evening, one of them clarifies.
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed to "Y" that the project has been submitted to the government.
A spokeswoman for Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Khloponin, who oversees subsoil use, told "Yu" that the project had not yet been submitted to the official's office.
"The auction can be announced as early as August, immediately after the release of the government order, and taking into account the deadline for collecting applications of potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender may take place as early as October," - say the Ministry of Natural Resources.
According to Yu, the project retains two key requirements for potential participants, spelled out in the version, which was sent to the ministries and FOIVam in July (there is a "z").
The first is the presence of at least 25% of state participation in the capital.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies controlled by foreign investors, based on the understanding of FH-57 about foreign investments in strategic societies.
According to the two articles mentioned in the draft articles of the FP, as already written by "Y" on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to the auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, as the Dry Log belongs to the depths of federal importance (stocks over 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies," but refused to comment on the details before the government's order.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the bidders was put forward by the Irkutsk region, the Ministry of Natural Resources said in December 2015, and was later confirmed by the governor of the region, Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources by his predecessor Sergey Yeroshchenko, who "had agreements on investment projects with Rostec."
Who lobbied for the restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interlocutors of "Y" do not specify.
"But this is in the spirit of the time: do not give control in the largest gold deposit in Russia against the background of Western sanctions," - says the interlocutor "Y" familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy said on August 1 that foreigners "can go to a consortium" if the applicants attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners."
The interlocutors of "Y" consider it unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for the Dry Log in the industry is considered a consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation PAO Polyus, controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and Rostec.
As "Y" wrote, in July the partners created the joint venture "SL Gold" where Polyus has 51% of shares, the structure of "Rostec" RT-GR - 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, and Polyus said it was "certainly interested in this asset" and had all the necessary competences and resources to develop it.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions," Polyus added.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision is up to the Russian government, the sources said.
Russian GV Gold and Canada's Kinross, which develops assets in Chukotka, have announced the possibility of participating in the development of the Dry Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold are not interested in the asset, according to the company.
In December 2015, the head of the Union of Gold Manufacturers of the Russian Federation, Sergey Kashuba, estimated the investment in Sukhoi Log at $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants are deterred not only by the amount of investment, but also by the complexity of the project: serious exploration of stocks and technology of working with complex ores is needed, the interlocutors of the industry explain.
In the pension market, the largest deal of the M-A - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" has launched the process of combining four controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of "Gazfund Pension Savings" will be created NPF with the volume of savings of about 373 billion rubles.
The launch of the procedure of combining four pension funds - KIT Finance, Promagrofund, Heritage and Gazfund Pension Savings - was announced yesterday by the owner of 100% of the funds of KIT Finance Pension Administrator LLC.
"The reorganization is carried out in coordination with the Central Bank, while complying with the requirement of non-deteriorating conditions of existing contracts," the company said in a statement.
The association is held on the basis of "Gazfund Pension Savings."
As oleg Byaloszycki, CEO of this NPF, notes, the merger of funds allows to solve several problems: expanding the geographical presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the estimated deadline for completion of consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the NPF"Gazfund Pension Savings" will become the largest player in the ops market.
As of March 31, the amount of pension savings of the pooling funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
According to the reporting on the fund's website, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through controlled LLC owns 65%) and Gazfund (35%).
However, the group itself launched much later competitors.
Thus, the group controlled by O1 NPF "Future" absorbed "Stalfond" earlier this year.
This combined NPF is currently joining the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
"Unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems," - says nikolai Sidorov, CEO of NPF "Future".
Active work on the consolidation of funds from April is also underway in the pension group "Safmar" - NPF "European," "Education and Science" and "Regionfund" should join the NPF "Safmar" before the end of this year.
In 2017, they will be joined by the Trust NPF.
"The pooling of funds will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, operating processes and expenses," the Pension Group said.
There are several reasons for the merger of funds, which was withstood by KIT Finance Pension Administrator, experts say.
Until recently, the NPF could not buy back more than 40% of the issue of infrastructure bonds, which actively housed the group.
After the amendments to the Central Bank's ruling in March this year on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator, such restrictions no longer exist.
If necessary, the entire issue can be bought out by one major player," said Yuri Nogin, director of the ratings group of financial institutions at ACRA.
Several managers of the NPF from the top 15 in terms of assets are another possible reason for the pause called the division of spheres of influence and, as a result, personnel appointments in a single fund, which were to be agreed by the owners of the group.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment.
Gazfund also did not respond to a request for comment.
Although the consolidation of funds is a time-consuming and expensive undertaking, this decision will be justified over a long distance.
As the CEO of the consulting company "Pension Partner" Sergey Okolesnov notes, "Gazfund Pension Savings" has less outflows, joining will stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, the more successful experience of KIT Finance and Promagrofund in the construction of retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software, will be in demand.
The requirements of the Central Bank for the processes and personnel of the NPF are constantly growing, so it is not advisable to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds under a single investment policy, said Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director of Corporate Ratings of Expert RA.
"The effect of reducing duplicative functions will definitely cover the possible costs of unification," Says Mr. Mitrofanov.
Sergey Okolesnov estimates the cost of combining the four funds at 30-50 million rubles.
"The cost of maintaining four funds of this size is about 400 million rubles a year, while consolidation in the medium term, the budget is really cut in half," - Mr. Okolesnov is sure.
In the Russian box office came the kindest Disney movie "Pete and his dragon."
Beautiful views of New zealand, a sympathetic dragon, a heart-wrenching history and songs in the style of country is enough to once again believe in old-fashioned magic, believes ELENA KRAVTSUN.
Scared baby picked up by a dragon, who became a human cub and a gentle nanny, and a devoted friend.
Pete calls his buddy Elliot, in honor of the puppy from the book of fairy tales, plays with him in the catch-up and falls asleep in the hug.
Six years later, he, who was left in a loincloth, can no longer distinguish from another clever forest tomboy - Mowgli.
In this form, Pete is discovered by a red-haired female ranger Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the brigade of Gavin (Karl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively rolls the forest.
Now she will not only have to believe in the existence of the dragon, but also help save him.
Pete runs a crash course of "be human" surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, moral code in the heart and smile more dazzlingly than in any advertisement.
No character looks and acts too badly for the viewer to truly start to hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who discovered the hunt for an atypical inhabitant of the forests under his control, is far from the incorrigible villain.
Huge fluffy dragon also turned out not to be terrible, with a good snout of a bulldog, airliner wingspan and the ability to become invisible.
Dragon is funny rumbling, purring, even grunts and, fortunately, does not speak, but he always wants to pat, this he differs from all known cinematic dragons.
Elliot's visual image and manner of holding on provide such a high degree of emotional engagement that in the most tense moments begin to desperately sob in the three streams not only small spectators, but also adults.
Surprisingly good and young Oaks Figley in the role of Pete, torn between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford masterfully betrays the canonical grandfather, who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten Disney film "Pete's Dragon" 1977, mediocre from nose to tip of the tail and remembered only by a mix of animation and game cinema, and make it the most soulful film of this summer?
No other than a miracle helped.
In his picture Lowry from the original, in fact, took only two things: orphan Pete and the dragon.
Overboard were musical numbers and most of the strange jokes.
In this kind fairy tale read features borrowed from "Bambi", "Alien" and many other sweet children's paintings.
Disney Studio continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remakes of the 21st century.
Of course, "Pete and the Dragon" isn't as stunningly beautiful as the "The Jungle Book," and it doesn't have the artful villain that Cate Blanchett found herself as stepmother in the new Cinderella.
But this naive film no less successfully helps to believe in miracles and goodness in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to the magical castle of Disney director Lowry will get once again - for the artistic adaptation of the story of "Peter Pan."
In the "Pete and his Dragon" tandem, David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks entered into a new ambitious project about a non-growing boy based on the fairy tale of the same name by James Barry.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov to face new charges
Lawyers for RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist structure, said that the prosecutor's office found flaws in the case of their client.
We learned from investigators yesterday that the prosecutor's office had made such a presentation.
We had a scheduled participation in the court session on the issue of limiting the familiarization with the materials of the criminal case, but the meeting in the end did not take place, and the investigators informed us about the submission made by the prosecutor's office," RBC quotes lawyer Olga Dinze as saying.
She said that the prosecutor's office pointed out to investigators the inconsistency of the qualifications of the case and the collected materials.
Now investigators will have to close the gaps in the evidence base and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze said.
Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the accusation the RBC journalist the wording about "shattering the political situation in the direction of instability" and "toppling the authorities illegally".
Kommersant Boscosport correspondent ALEXANDER SILBERT lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic Village, inspected the home of the Russian national team, had lunch in the local canteen and even passed the WADA test afterwards.
Life doesn't seem to be transfixed for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end after midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, non-stop settlement and eviction from the village, as some athletes finish their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only come here.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all Olympic delegations are drawn to one of the temporary awnings.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational domestic issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which ours were housed, consider, exemplary - it was commissioned one of the first and demonstrated to all inspectors, even in it every now and then there are some flaws.
It's with hot water problems, then, sorry, with toilets.
We fought for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the clinchers began to come, but only smacked with some substance on the floor, and that's it.
Their floors, you see, are innovative.
Like, you can't wash them humanly.
Yes, we know these floors - laminate ordinary!
In general, we have achieved a change of cleaning company and now with this all OK.
The Olympic Village is a South Butovo, a sleeping area fenced on one side by mountains, on the other - an impressive moat, sometimes flooded with water.
Well, for reliability there is still a two-meter iron fence around the perimeter, along which the machine guns walk.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3,604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is completely given to the needs of our national team.
Looking at the small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems, apparently, are the most pressing for the national team.
At the front desk hang two ads: the printed "Please don't throw the paper in the toilet!" and the hand "I'll donate badges.
The stand itself is buried in booklets.
Their cheerful color contrasts with the titles of the brochures: "Memory on infectious diseases for those traveling to Rio de Janeiro," "First aid for drowning, getting a foreign body into the airways, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiopulmonary resuscitation," "First aid for burns, heat stroke, fractures and bleeding."
The text inside is generally reassuring.
For example, "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, not everyone is waiting for a favorable outcome.
Of course, the Russian national team has a medical center, which at any time is ready to provide residents of the house with qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massage.
Opposite the medical center is the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster "No matter what, we will win!".
And, of course, poems:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear believe in them believe in them.
Let the less of us, the sweeter the taste of victories, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for even more uplifting, an ad hangs: "Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Russia, Kirill, the spiritual care of the athletes of the Russian Olympic team is carried out by the proto-priest Andrei Alekseev.
You can order a prayer and other demands by phone...
In general, the village has a Center for Meditation and Religious Rites for representatives of all faiths.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, are in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the congestion of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to be used during the fire.
And in the dark I tripped over the bodies lying on her.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of a new cleaning company.
I suppose, in readiness at any moment to throw themselves on the wash of innovative floors, they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor I was waiting for a meeting with a long-time friend - Vitaly Dubko, the coach of our trampolines, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his pupil, European champion Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
There is nothing to complain about, - the honored coach of Russia shares his impressions. - We live in two, the beds, of course, almost back-to-back stand, but it is uncritical.
The bathroom is one for four, but spacious.
The closet is, of course, funny, fabric, trust does not cause, but things can be put.
"No, well, you pretend they're out of tea!" - tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, who met me in the main dining room, throws her hands.
The main it is called at least because it is a space of 2.7 thousand square meters and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
Here give out on-mountain 60,000 servings a day completely free.
Menu options include :Best of Brazil, Kitchens of the World, Asian Dishes and Pizza, Pasta.
The latter option, as I saw it, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, let's say, I did not find soups in any of the units of the giant restaurant.
What soups? - Kuznetsova is surprised. "There's no tea!
It's a good thing I took the Chinese with me, the custard.
And a kettle.
But in general, just so you understand, our meals on the courts are even worse.
There is at least something you can choose, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose steamed cod and meatballs in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish is a plaque with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as indicating the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, quite, to admit, it was edible.
I don't even know why such a queue is worth all the time at the local McDonald's.
We can say "warm" athletes on the way out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They lure cleverly - a quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
Provoked, you might say!
To get a gift, you need to correctly answer at least eight questions out of ten.
There are questions on the Russian! - attacked me a girl from WADA.
But she attacked the wrong one.
That is, I was in a patriotic impulse, of course.
The situation escalated on the second question: "If I received a notice of doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?"
I settled on option B: "No - I have one hour."
Lost, so to speak, vigilance.
I forgot that WADA does not have to wait for relief.
In general, we need to be immediately.
Well, on the seventh stage of the quiz, my position became quite critical.
For some reason I thought that if I find it difficult to follow a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and I, by the way, it is difficult!), then I can use bioadditives to get "additional nutrients to improve my performance".
No, they don't allow it!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that is categorically not prohibited, but strongly, in several sentences dissuade.
Unfairly plays it WADA!
How are you, Russia? - the quiz presenter asks mockingly.
There is nowhere to retreat - behind Efimov, Isinbayeva and our entire bloodless team.
So I focused and won the unfortunate t-shirt out of my last effort.
Know, as they say, ours!
In a victorious mood, I wandered into the fitness center next door.
I was interested in counting simulators.
He's 250.
He was surprised to note that not a single Russian athlete was found in this pile of treadmills.
But maybe it's correct?
Let the one who can't play train!
But in a nearby clinic, one of our guys was sitting.
In line to the optometrist.
Don't worry, don't be a shooter.
In the clinic, however, as well as throughout the village, wherever you spit, hangs a device for issuing condoms.
It has an encouraging call: "Celebrate with a condom!"
Then it remains only to twist the iron, resembling the handle of the door lock, and a condom, made of natural latex Amazonia, readily falls out of the device.
I took one, as a keepsake.
From the athletes will not leave - they brought them 450,000.
Just for a festive and idle pastime in the Olympic Village there is a whole entertainment center.
Near it just in case there is an educational sign reminding that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million per day on athletes in different ways.
The center is awash with video games, pool and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices similar to video simulators.
What's this all about? - I am interested in a friend in the form of the Ukrainian national team, who actively uses an outlandish toy.
Of course, you could just say that he doesn't want to talk to a man in the form of the Russian national team, and that's it.
Here, by the way, by some strange coincidence in the eyes ripples from the guys in the black-and-black.
The most playing team, it turns out.
To get around the whole village, looking into each corner of it, you need at least three hours.
But, if you just walk, and not ride on electric cars, you will open and the house of the Canadian national team with a moose at the entrance and a tent with a restorative bathroom, and the ticket office, and laundry, and dry cleaning, and hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with goods of everyday consumption, and mail with unique stamps (only you still can not wait out the queue of Chinese philatelists) , and the bank, and the bureau finds, and photokiosk.
And late in the evening you, exhausted, will sat near an olive tree, hung with colorful ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of athletes who left this world.
And you'll be accompanied by a machine that randomly sprays insect-killing liquid, think of the eternal.
That is about the Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world breathlessly watched as the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went into the net.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglasova won gold in the rapier at the XXXI Olympics, I got first.
Maybe I'm even the only Muscovite who saw it happen - not counting those, of course, who watched the competition in Carioca that night.
Only a real fan can understand this.
Imagine: a dead-and-oh Moscow night.
Neighbors from below - as always at 1 a.m. - wake up and start viciously, but very loudly shout at each other.
And it's threatening to move furniture.
In the kitchen a faucet flows - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as asked by the plumber, a new one.
Nothing is clear in the television schedule, so I just kept the match, First and Russia channels under control- though it's almost pointless.
"Russia" is the birthplace of repetitions, all sport there for some reason in the record.
There, the series is broadcast live.
Hope, of course, on "Match" - the whole evening a young man shouted in newscasts first about the great semi-final of Deriglasov-Shanayev, then about the upcoming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead basketball - USA--Australia.
I can't say anything bad about this decision, by the way.
The Australians were on an equal footing, the first half generally won.
They put americans in the place of their own greatness.
As a result, we lost, but, as they now say, the Olympic basketball tournament will not be the same.
That's all well and good, but the fight is coming with Di Franchiska, and the screen without change.
In a slight panic I start flipping channels.
It feels like it's the second time in a row they've been spinning.
Okay, let's go deep on the cable.
There is no fencing on any of the thematic "Match".
And I feel like the fight's about to start.
Text and tweet broadcasts of some sports sites do not suit me.
Convulsive surfing gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the website of "First" it turns out that there is a live technical broadcast of all the competitions that take place at this point in time.
I click on fencing, get a fight for gold.
Deriglasova is excellent counterattack, goes forward on points - and quite obviously begins to pull time.
The Italian wins almost the entire gap.
Ours is one point ahead, to the end a little more than two seconds.
Di Franchiska rushes at Deriglasova, she retreats, time is running out, the Italian injects.
victory!
A couple of seconds later, the Olympic messenger on the phone reports about the fourth gold medal.
So I'm the first one to see it with my own eyes.
Crazy, loyal, implicated.
The Spiritual Administration of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the Plenum of the DUM obliged its imams to conduct Friday sermons only in Tatar to force young Tatars to "learn their native language."
The department says it "in no way infringes" on the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
Some mosques in Kazan complain that up to 60% of parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves, do not understand the Tatar language.
Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar "will not reach the whole audience."
Yesterday, the plenum of the DUM of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in Tatar language.
According to the Mufti of Tatarstan, Kamil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to "learn their native language."
"For those who say that "it is hard" in every large mosque we intend to organize lessons of the Tatar language absolutely free of charge," - promised Mr. Samigullin.
He added that "the decision has already come into force" and today in all mosques the sermons "should already be in Tatar language."
He recalled that the DUM of Tatarstan publishes a magazine "Shura" with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
The imam, who does not speak Tatar well enough, "can prepare for them thoroughly."
The DUM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the mufti, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language in the districts.
At the same time, a number of mosques in Kazan used predominantly Russian.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, the "Ensary" and "Eniler".
However, Mr. Mukhametshin stressed that the leadership sets a task for all students to speak both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"There is no question of any infringement of non-Tatar Muslims," Mr. Mukhametshin said, explaining that the sermon itself "is not mandatory, the main part of the namaz."
At the same time, namaz itself will continue to be read in Arabic, lectures and lessons in Russian language will be preserved in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin told "Y" that there was no serious threat of ousting the Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are not used in sermons in the republic.
The decision of the DUM was actively supported in the executive committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT).
The head of the VCT executive committee, Rinat Sakirov, said: "Mecheti is an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language left this sphere.
He noted that the sermons are only in Tatar language "the desire of the imams themselves," but the VCT executive committee "believes it is the right thing to do."
The imams interviewed by the "Y" who preached at the Russian are ready to implement the DUM decision, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulties in understanding the clergy.
Both Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many people don't understand the language.
They're going to be tough, of course.
"We will have to rebuild," said Farhat Mavletdinov, imam of the Burnaev Mosque.
According to him, sermons in Russian language are closer even to many Tatars, because "Russian in schools, kindergartens, radio - everywhere initially."
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian language, which are held on other days.
We rely on Allah.
Allah will show a way out of this situation," he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we switched to Russian for four years," the imam says.
He believes that in the Tatar language the sermons will "reach a narrower circle and will not reach the whole audience."
But we will obey the decision of the plenum.
It's just that the result of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
"For me, for example, it will only be easier, because the Tatar language is my native language," concluded Gabdullah Galiullin.
Former director of FSIN put on trial
The Moscow Prosecutor's Office has approved an indictment in the criminal case investigated by the SKR State Security Service on the embezzlement of budget funds allocated to the needs of the FSIN of Russia.
Former head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused damage to the FSIN worth more than 2.7 billion rubles, will appear before the court.
The Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office has sent a criminal case against the former director of the FSIN of Russia, Alexander Reimer, his former deputy Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the director of the Federal Service for Information and Technology and Communications of the Federal Service for the Execution of Punishments (FGUP CITOS) Viktor Odeterminenov.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are charged by the SKR State Security Service in Moscow under Article 3, 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers, which caused serious consequences), Article 4, 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using his official position, as part of an organized group, on a particularly large scale).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under Article 1, 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SKR, in 2010-2012, these persons fraudulently stole from the state treasury budget funds allocated to the FSIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems controlled by persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
To steal budget money, the group developed a scheme under which the company controlled by FGUP CITOS, with which the relevant government contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision, including "electronic bracelets", and sold at prices inflated several times.
Despite the fact that FGUP CITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, facilities to accommodate production facilities, allowing to create a complete cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", between him and the FSIN of Russia were concluded five state contracts worth more than 3.3 billion rubles.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubles were found in the accounts of the Samara branch of FGUP, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles of cash was received personally by Mr. Reimer in his office from one of the accomplices, the criminal case against which is allocated in a separate proceeding.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the fraud, was found of unknown origin cartridges to the award gun, which allowed him to bring additional charges.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN filed a claim for damages of 2.7 billion rubles.
Footballer Hakan Shukur is suspected of involvement in the putsch.
Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for former footballer and then-member of parliament Hakan Shukur and searched two of his family's homes.
Turkish football star of the 1990s and early 2000s striker Hakan Shukur is wanted by the authorities in connection with the coup attempt last month.
The forward, who graduated from his sporting career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an "armed terrorist group."
This is the "Hizmet" movement, a society associated with a well-known Turkish religious figure and opposition figure Fethullah Gulen.
It is his President Erdogan considers the organizer of the attempted military coup, which happened on July 15.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the U.S. and Turkish authorities are demanding his extradition.
According to local media, today a arrest warrant was issued for Hakan Shukur, the police have already conducted searches in two houses that belong to the family of the former football player.
According to investigators, fethullah Gulen's organization in addition to Hakan Shukur included his father.
However, neither the former footballer nor his relatives were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a footballer, Hakan Shukur defended the colors of several Turkish clubs and played for the national team.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian Torino, Inter and Palermo, as well as English Blackburn.
However, in none of them he did not spend more than one season.
Hakan Shukur is still Turkey's most productive striker, with 112 appearances for the national team and 51 goals.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur resigned from his post because of a corruption investigation surrounding Erdogan's party and his inner circle.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, on July 25, arrest warrants were issued in Turkey for the arrest of at least 42 journalists.
They are accused of facilitating a military coup and having links to the U.S.-based opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen.
Given the severity of the charges, members of the media can face lengthy prison sentences ranging from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
"I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, tickets for which cost 2-3 times less than for foreign-made films," he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for the viewer with major Hollywood films.
In our country, more than 100 paintings are made every year, of which an average of 20-25 tapes reach the screens.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with "Transformers" and "Iron Man", in the promotion of which are pumped huge budgets," - said the filmmaker.
On July 1, the All-Russian Youth Education Forum "Tavrida" started work in Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and a number of countries near and far abroad.

The Russian Copper Company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RMC has taken up the modernization of one of the oldest and most environmentally "dirty" enterprises in the country - the Karabakh copper smelter.
The Karabakh copper smelter was founded by an English company headed by Leslie Urquhart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually provided life for the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was halted, causing serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, it was decided to reopen the Karabakh copper smelter.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - ecological.
By the early 2000s, Karabakh was notoriously known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company came under the control of the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize production, which gradually reduced the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the governor of Chelyabinsk region Boris Dubrovskiy, who visited Karabashmed in early July.
The head of the Southern Urals called the huge changes that have taken place with the company since Karabashmed moved to the RMC group.
The main event to modernize Karabashmedi in recent years was the construction of a new sulfuric acid plant, allowing to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to Vsevolod Levin, president of the Russian Copper Company, the amount of investment in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of the modernization of Karabashmed is the reconstruction of the converter.
Replacement of three converters, sprays, gas-shipping tract is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new industrial sewage treatment plant worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amount of taxes paid to the budget of the city of Karabakh will also grow.
For the entire duration of the Tominsky GOK project - from the beginning of construction to the commissioning of the second phase - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the commissioning of the GOK, the receipt of taxes to the budgets of all levels can amount to 80.9 billion rubles.
During the year of production in the Varna region, 346.3 million rubles were transferred to budgets of different levels.
And that's for the first year.
"The longer the company successfully operates, the amount of deductions can be more," Valery Ulanovsky added.
The RMC specified that in 2015 tax deductions from Mikheevsky GOK came close to 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of RMC enterprises in the life and development of the territories of their presence is not limited to tax deductions.
RMC enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, to build cultural and entertainment facilities, to improve the territory.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian copper company in Karabakh was an overhaul, and in fact - almost complete restructuring of kindergarten N9 for 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in a state of disrepair.
Also on the territory of the "RMC Arena" will be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and above-ground parking for 600 cars, cafes and sports shops.
"RMC Arena" will allow to hold spectacular professional sports events of international level.
But the main goal of this project is to make physical education and sports in comfortable conditions accessible to residents of Chelyabinsk, primarily for children.

WSJ: The U.S. is considering imposing sanctions against Russia because of the hacking of Democrats' servers.
U.S. officials are considering imposing new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of Democratic Party servers, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama will reportedly have to formally blame Russian or Russian-backed hackers for the attack on servers.
According to the sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia's involvement in the cyberattack.
The WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefers not to name those who carry out hacking attacks.
The exception is the 2014 hacking of Sony Entertainment Pictures' database, for which the DPRK was officially responsible.
Last year, however, Obama issued an executive order simplifying the way sanctions are imposed on those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
Initially it was directed against China, but can be used against other countries.
The process of deciding on sanctions can be lengthy, the newspaper writes.
Even if officials have concluded that the hackers acted with Russian support, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose the information.
They will have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was reported that the Obama administration allows the possibility of sanctions against the state, whose hackers hacked the servers of the Democratic National Committee.
The WikiLeaks website published the email correspondence of the Democratic National Committee.
Media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities may be involved in the hacking.
The Kremlin called such reports absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was the violation of competition in the mobile application market.
Antitrust proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google gives smartphone manufacturers access to Android components on terms that prohibited pre-installation of applications from other developers, in particular, Yandex.
THE FAS found evidence of these claims and found the company abused its dominant position in the market and imposed the installation of other apps along with the Google Play store.
As a result of the inspection, the Federal Antitrust Service decided to punish Google, said the deputy head of fas Alexey Dotsenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the order coming into force.
The FAS concluded that the competition law must be respected by all companies, including multinationals.
In turn, Google intends to first study the decision and only then determine with further actions: execute it or challenge it.
The Federal Antitrust Service found the company a violation of competition law in September last year and ordered to adjust the contracts until December 18.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the agency have been conducting legal proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a peace agreement.
This measure will lead to nothing.
This opinion was expressed by Eldar Murtazin, a leading analyst at Mobile Research Group.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

Snapchat's 'Anime' effect criticised as caricature of Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some reviewers say it is racially tactless.
With the Lens tool, Snapchat allows approximately 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, dog or character to catch a picture of Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are coarse, curving tools that create more than 30 million adjusted selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become well-known.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past when they have been accused of advertising dark facial skin or promoting bleached faces as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them slanted eyes, crooked teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics found it a racist caricature of Asians as "yellow-faced."
And they wondered whether these recurring contradictions pointed to the company's more serious diversity problem.
On Wednesday, messages spread and sparked outrage in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company commented: the lens was intended as a homage to the characters of the anime, not as a caricature of Asians.
But experts who know about racism firsthand, the lens reminded of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with the anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was actively shared, said the lens was "offensive and at least embarrassing."
She added that "it's hard to argue with the comparison side by side of a very crude caricature of Asians and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow-faced, but highly pejorative yellow-faced.
Snapchat isn't the only company passing through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be embroiled in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diverse than their older generation - may mean they are more likely to be understood.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, 25-year-old Katie Joo said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder to go unnoticed like it used to be."
On Thursday, Joo, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes racial contradictions are the reason for the lack of diversity in recruitment in Snepchat.
Yu criticized the predominantly white leadership of the company, consisting only of men and ended her article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Joo, herself a Chinese American, wrote: "Either they didn't have enough non-white people in the state who could make such decisions, or they have non-white people, but they don't hold positions where they can speak safely and openly."
Other reviewers shared her view, expressing displeasure that Snapchat had not answered most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial origins of its staff, but the trustee said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on actively trying to engage domestic resources.
For her part, Joo said she would keep her Snapchat account private, adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us so they can say it's not going to work."
Military leadership misrepresents intelligence on ISIS, congressional committee says
Officials from the U.S. Central Command have altered intelligence reports to provide a more upbeat picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the ground is based on the ground, the congressional committee said in a report released Thursday.
An interim report by the task force, set up by Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations, found "widespread discontent" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who say the leaders were adjusting their assessments of U.S. actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military command in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence documents approved by Centcom's high command tended to provide a more upbeat portrayal of U.S. counterterrorism than evidenced by real data from the scene, and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies," the report said in a news release.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable: when the top leadership is given an inaccurate analysis, our military suffers," said Rep. Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
Problems with the leadership in Centcom reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the flaws that occurred in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analyzing U.S. actions aimed at training Iraq's armed forces provided by Central Command.
While it does not provide definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration's administration ordered the falsification of the reports, he argues that analysts felt centcom's leadership was forcing them to take a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and testimony of the Central Command in Congress were significantly more optimistic than real events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigation, this is certain," Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top intelligence team of U.S. Central Command forged command intelligence documents to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans set up a task force when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State had been tampered with.
As the investigation progresses, a report released Thursday will be followed by more unwrapped data.
An additional, currently unfinished investigation into Centcom's intelligence is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the House Intelligence Committee of the U.S. Congress released their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly closed intelligence assessment process for ISIS and Iraqi security forces," Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic party's top representative on the committee, said in a statement.
The procedure, Schiff said, "has stalled the release of intelligence documents," has damaged analysts' morale and "insufficiently reflects divergent views."
But Schiff and Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House tried to force Centcom analysts to adjust their findings to a "given or political interpretation."
Preliminary results of the congressional investigation were presented Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon's chief inspector, which was opened after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the chief inspector's investigation continues.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of comprehensive data, and the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."
The implications of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing in Iraq and Syria (as is now claimed by more and more Defense Department officials) is being targeted.
But last year's announcements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on Central Command to provide truthful assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of intelligence on the Islamic State echoes controversy more than a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article claiming that President George W. Bush's administration had come out in support of a small number of troops in Iraq because of the protests of many analysts and did not think what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest over intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said, Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes on oil refineries owned by the Islamic State did not significantly worsen the terror group's financial situation because it built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside Central Command, the Times reported in September.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate that many lawmakers deemed overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by the Central Command Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins 4 times in a row in women's field hockey, bringing closer to crucial showdown with Britain
Having scored three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam opened the scoring on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team, when the Americans defeated India 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27, says she's not sure if she'd ever done something like that.
"I can't do it," she said.
I'm not really the kind of person who tracks their goals.
Here's what she knows: The Americans are 4-0 up in the Olympic tournament, and they are competing for first place in their group with Britain, which remains unbeaten after losing to Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
The teams of Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams claim the quarter-finals, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams, and who - the second.
The winner will avoid meeting with a strong team of rivals from Holland, leaders of the other group, a little later, when the quarterfinal games begin.
But Saturday's game shows that the Americans here have made a fuss about their unexpected series, four years after they finished last among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she failed to qualify for the final line-up.
Then came 2012, when everything went wrong with her and her teammates.
The following year, Koeig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach and things started to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, a change in physical fitness," Bam said.
In London we didn't have the kind of performance that we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a throw with an awkward hand at short range.
India came to the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly tight and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative.
She made a long pass with the ball down the left side of the field, then spiraled into the middle and abruptly sent the ball into the net, thus giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The dry win was the first in the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who conceded one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's on the beat.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," Parnham said, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the midst of the Fury of the Olympic Games - "zen" jumps on a trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how long it is, it's the Olympics.
Events in Rio de Janeiro seem unchanged and inevitable, it is a frenzied combination of competition and aspiration.
As if the Olympic flame itself is that burning torch, which is passed from archer to swimmer, to gymnast, to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or overhear your neighbors' conversation in turn at the cafe and not hear about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is competing in the Olympics for the first time, a handsome man with dimples on his cheeks, could well be among those celebrities who are shown in prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencer.
But 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline jumping competition.
The Olympic flame does not cover all events equally.
Further from the center, partly in the shadows, are those sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I'm allowed to speak timidly in defense of my personal addiction, let me draw your attention to the humble charm of jumping on a trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they made their debut at the Sydney Games, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed were unaware that they were even in Olympic sport.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in trampoline jumping, and their athletes did not reach the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians tend to share male awards, while Chinese and Canadians are women's awards.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumping has the charm of an outsider, in part because the unenlightened ear is more associated with circus college than with the Olympics.
Here I must admit that I am not an expert, but only a down-to-earth enthusiast.
They do have comic potential - it's a caricature of endless jumps - but also the finesse of gymnastics and diving, two sports that they mostly combine.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word "el trampol", meaning "jump for diving."
The contenders jump on a giant trampoline, taking off in the air by almost 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends and flips) before the final landing on their feet.
They are assessed by performance, complexity and "flight time" according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
Medal contenders must go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth on the field.
They strive not only to the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in full view of the TV cameras, to another teasing frontier: the world or the Olympic record.
This stubborn desire is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to make even the viewer wept.
But it, in my opinion, is a little tiring when watching the Games.
From it jumping on a trampoline give a respite.
The trampoline's direction is up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps up, seems weightless like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And they, of course, is not without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program there is no mad zeal to the finish line, no long jumps, only marvelous, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
It is the closest Olympic sport to zen.
The women's qualifiers and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast at 1 p.m. Eastern European time; men's - On Saturday, also in an hour.
NBC will broadcast the finale as part of the daytime program starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of Olympic madness is expected a quiet, beautiful moment that can be easily seen in the general landfill.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by exposing male athletes to coveted views and objectification - as, according to the Wall Street Journal, recently suggested by male gymnasts from the United States - Dooley is just waiting for his new admiring crowd of fans.
"Generation protests" in Ethiopia, longtime U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia faced fierce opposition from the Government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally injured during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of splitting?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a staunch ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights advocates, the government's response was brutal.
Eyewitnesses claimed that police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video footage from the protest sites, believed to have been filmed late last year or earlier this year, shows security officers beating young men with sticks as they are put against a wall.
The United Nations high-level human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from disintegrating, and it will be even more difficult to keep," said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project at the International Crisis Research Group.
Ethiopia is Africa's second densely populated country after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly- there is even a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy - human rights organizations constantly mention government repression - the opposition in the territory of the state was suppressed, due to the fact that dissidents were actually silenced.
Many of them have been exiled, imprisoned, killed or driven to remote deserts.
But that could change.
"If people are constantly oppressed and left with no choice but to protest, an uprising will rise," said Seium Teshome, a lecturer at the university in central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints are numerous, ranging from land use to the seizure of power by a government coalition.
After widespread elections last year, the government party and its allies have completely supplanted the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are increasing; The struggle for this uncertain, contentious border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the unrest and rearm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, several years boiling in the back of your mind, flare up now.
The first, seemingly completely harmless: smartphones.
In the last couple of years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and Internet service has improved.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find the ability to communicate through proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that was how they organized the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, Amhara from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands has flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in low-lying areas.
But it's also changing.
"We will work together under one," said Mulatu Gemechu, Oromo's leader.
The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo districts.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tygray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 per cent of the population and which controls the military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have foreseen danger.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at recognizing the first signals of discontent and used scouts to obtain data and neutralize opponents.
"The current regime lacks common sense," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, came out of nowhere and took Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, who was originally from the Tygray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not have the trust of the security services controlled by Tygray.
Many fear that this will lead to more bloodshed as a result.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people protested what analysts said appeared to be elections that the government slogged and then forged the results.
In the ensuing repression, many Protestants were killed, albeit in smaller numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest has passed relatively quickly.
Development experts commended Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure development, such as the new long-distance train and the significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the growing internal discontent of the Ethiopian Government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a town in Amhar, attacked businesses owned by Tygray, and anti-Tygray hatred on social media became comprehensive.
Analysts say the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand it does not want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
"And it's going to be hard to get through this tightrope," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his claim that ISIS was founded by Obama, 'sarcasm'
Donald J. Trump Trump sought to hush up the latest conflict engulfing his campaign on Friday, claiming he was joking when he claimed several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the Ability of the Republican presidential candidate to address the American people wisely.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during the troubles, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
In saying that assumption at the convention on Wednesday night, Trump strongly pressed on his assertion on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a Twitter post early Friday morning, Trump tweeted that he was just an echidna.
The post was the exact opposite of an allegation made just a day earlier, when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remarks by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee didn't take the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted as Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy amid a declining rating.
Trump and Clinton delivered competing speeches about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to revisit the topic.
Again, using Twitter, he cautioned that Clinton's plans would lead to tax increases, and said he thought her speech was boring.
Trump has previously used sarcasm as an excuse.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism by practically saying the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks, saying, "Of course I'm joking."
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is acceptable in political speech and take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing messages that resonate with his fans, watching them act, and then "explaining" them in one direction or another, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his statements and knows that they're vague enough to interpret them differently.
Instead of softening his rhetoric for the broader electorate, Trump has taken an even more stinging tone in recent days, while his approval rating continues to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed Trump trailing Clinton by a wide margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and is trailing her in Florida.
While Trump generally tries not to apologize for provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has come under increased scrutiny in the final months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have left his loyal allies in an awkward position: They have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York who is one of Trump's most prominent deputies, made a serious effort to defend the candidate in an interview given to CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is an acceptable political commentary," Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, tiny organization, he called it non-threatening, totally unfair, and that's why it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most average Republicans say that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to develop because it failed to deal hard with the Situation in the Middle East.
Before a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for smearing his every word and bias toward him.
He mocked the "poor unfortunate" television experts who were trying to figure it out, and said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats have derided Trump's excuses as further evidence that he is unfit for president.
Once-displaced coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
The Verb coffee shop was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn't have Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of her room with a showcase on Bedford Avenue.
The Soup Sheri store, which took the place of "Verb" in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the latest loss in the new city.
Artist Molly Krabaple wrote on Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb has now become a soap shop."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it, in turn, is updated.
The revived Verb coffee shop opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new "Verbe" has Wi-Fi and accept credit cards, but there are some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Besides, the coffee is still good.
At the head of the new "Verba" is Sisko Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and was there until the very end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new place, he said that he would gladly go for it.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, left a lot in his former form.
"Verb" works with the same distributor of bagels and bought the same model of coffee machine.
It even has chandeliers from the old "Verba."
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu includes bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches, and is available with caper toppings or fried onions.
There are brown rice dishes.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now prepares freshly squeezed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many former customers were also squeezed out of Williamsburg," he said.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such client.
Oliveira, who is 34, used to live in Williamsburg and often attended Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After the closure of Verba, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was the coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me in Verba," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although that day instead of the usual ice-coffee she ordered blended tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been a devoted visit to "Verb" since 2003.
He went in front of work and ordered the same thing.
"At fifteen minutes of the eighth, every day, as for hours, I would come and prepare my bagel with butter and all the fillings," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today Rosenthal still makes a regular order, but someday he will change something with bacon, egg or cheese on a bagel with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended that the soap shop once took over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of "Soup Sheri" offered to make a special soap for "Verba" using coffee from a coffee shop, prepared in a cold way, as an ingredient.
"I think we might agree to their offer," Rodriguez said.
Permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also liked this coffee shop.
One of these new customers has translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to find a place for him in the shop window to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has other benefits.
The local juice outlet plans to bottle and sell cold-cooked coffee.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will join the adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verb" will include on the menu their favorite dishes.
Joseph Witt was a regular and shared that he was heartbroken when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Witt said that when he went inside and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he had come home.
"How long have I wanted to feel this fragrance," he admitted.
Depressive eating depression in "Dense Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to dinner in the Oval Office.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt loved fashion dishes from Fifth Avenue, such as foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert - prunes pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message to Americans on how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food history specialists.
Coea's latest book, "Ragu in Chinese," was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of life in a rented apartment on the Lower East Side through food in her book,""s House 97 on Fruit Garden Street.
Their new collaboration, "The Dense Meal," to be published Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some degree of culinary solidarity, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny simple diner in the Flatiron quarter that has been operating since 1929, the year of the stock market collapse.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with slices of olives, while Coe, 57, took turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable mixture.
When a reporter ordered a meatloaf, the couple thought it was a fitting starting point for a discussion about food during the Depression era.
"Rolls were in high demand," Siegelman said.
There was a peanut roll, a liver roll, a bean roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to stretch.
Imagine that you ate as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe winced.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a rock," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in the countryside, was a buffet.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "Dense Meal" describes how the country coped with the fact that suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, challenging topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as difficult: mysterious dishes, such as rolls and casseroles, became staple foods; Casserole is "a great way to recycle leftovers," Siegelman noted, because chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for many years was the basis of American food, has become a sparingly distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures, because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While researching for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of that era: baked onions stuffed with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a success," Coe said.
Siegelman added: "It was very strange."
Peanut butter is completely unsuitable for baked onions.
This was typical of many household recipes.
More than ever since, economics specialists - including Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Economics from 1923 to 1943 - managed the country's eating habits.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "budget makers", accept the challenge and transform the burda like rubbed spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
"A dense meal" is a feast of curious historical facts.
Particularly piquant stories about the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let's eat pies" attitude.
Publicly extolling a simple Iowa farm concoction during his childhood, he fed up like the sophisticated millionaire he became.
"He liked continental cuisine, like fish and cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate almost in the gilded dining room, putting on a tuxedo.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book says, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was completely un interested in taste, and this led to the White House "consuming not only the most dull food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked."
Many of the Culinary Experiences of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Siegelman says, and on how science has been used in cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they had a better understanding of Siegelman's mother's eating habits - that she couldn't throw away food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being negligent in her eating," Coe said.
Siegelman recalls, "She seriously poisoned people."
There was one unpleasant case with profitrols.
When Eisenberg's plates emptied, he and Coe took out a dessert they had prepared at home: a prunes dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called prune mousse," Siegelman said, adding that it was a common use of giving modest recipes catchy names.
There was no whipped cream, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All reluctantly loaded the spoon into a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe twice requested supplements.
In the voice of a confident budgeter, he told his wife: "A few chopped walnuts would not hurt here."
Arrest of defendants in the case of mass brawl at Khovan cemetery extended until November 14
The Presnensky court remanded the defendants in the case of a mass brawl at the Khovan cemetery under arrest until November 14, granting the relevant request of the investigation.
Fourteen people are being tried as defendants.
On May 14, a mass brawl of several hundred Central Asians and North Caucasus gunmen took place at the Khovan cemetery, killing three people.
Former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuyev and lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Alexander Bocharnikov charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be solved within the next two to three weeks.
This was announced on August 12 by Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have specific parameters for how much pension should be raised in order to lower the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Now economists are summing up the half-year results, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks," Interfax quoted Golodets as saying.
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Development Alexei Kudrin to raise the retirement age for six months each year, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Cabinet does not consider this topic.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan made it to the final of the small-caliber rifle shooting competition.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan have reached the final of the competition in small-caliber rifle shooting from the position lying down at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergey Kamensky scored 629 points and took first place - a new Olympic record in qualifying.
Kirill Grigoryan was second - 628.9 was.
In total, eight of the best athletes made it to the final.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gulen is demanding an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt," French newspaper Le Monde quoted Gulen as saying.
The Turkish opposition leader also said that "if any part of the accusations is confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen strongly denies involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
A court in Istanbul has previously arrested opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen in absentia.
Recall that the attempted military coup took place in Turkey on the night of July 15 to 16.
Gilead to reimburse legal fees during hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to receive reimbursement for the legal fees it incurred in connection with a lawsuit over a patent for a hepatitis C drug with drug manufacturer Merck Co Inc, a federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was cleared of $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's drugs, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a number of violations by Merck, including affidavits and other unethical acts.
In a court filing Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to reimbursement for the costs incurred in challenging the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to the laboratory work underpins sofosbuvir, Gilead's active ingredient in drugs.
U.S.-backed forces claim to have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after leaving the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants, Sharfahan Darwish of the SDF-allied Manbij military council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are taking clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in revenue this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in speaking fees, and the former secretary of state announced a $3 million income from publisher Simon Schuster for her book about her tenure in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, released his 10-year tax returns.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set a standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign adviser Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In the exact opposite of them, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and breaking his past promises to make his tax returns public.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cited the Irs audit as the reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
"Your move," Clinton campaign adviser Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic nominee's declarations.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN he would not allow Trump to release them until the checks are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, said his refusal raises questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and other ties, including those with Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue and on Friday released an online video that focused on prominent Republicans who urged Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades without exception: to release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or nearly any taxes in two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants as saying that may still be the case.
Federal tax rates have been the subject of controversy in the presidential election.
Clinton backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would have guaranteed that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, suggested Trump meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he, too, is under IRS scrutiny, and that Trump is "afraid" not of the tax collection agency, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign released tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective cumulative tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income source was wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons declared dividends and capital gains of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks increase protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania are using an unconventional way to prevent elephants from wandering into populated areas - throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American Committee for Conservation of Nature, took over its promotion by teaching volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a four-step nonviolent way to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many have previously used spears to protect themselves.
Friday will be World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we invented the toolkit ... we've seen a change in attitudes within these communities, making them much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps are to light the torch in front of the elephant that has violated the border and signal with the horn.
If it is not able to scare off, then throw the so-called "cloud of chili."
The chili powder mixed with the soil is placed with the flap in the condom, and its end is twisted, the outside is only a wick.
When ignited, the condom bursts with a crash, spraying the fine dust of chili powder in the air.
One whiff is usually enough to turn the elephant the other way.
The extreme measure is a launcher that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Thirty-two Turkish diplomats who left the country after an attempted coup in July have yet to return to Turkey.
Such data was cited by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in an interview with local journalists.
In the first stage, we recalled 208 staff diplomats to continue their work at the center.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations," the head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.
In July, a coup attempt took place in Turkey.
The country's authorities officially declared that the coup had failed, and also reported the detention of more than six thousand people, among them senior and middle-level military officials.
According to the Turkish Foreign Ministry, 290 people were killed in the coup attempt.
Jewish filmmaker sharply criticizes Berlin hotel for deleting Israeli phone code at "request" of Arabs - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin has unleashed a media scandal after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have An Israeli phone code on the list, with employees citing "requests" from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, expressed his displeasure with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German media.
During his recent stay at the Hotel, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in a list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states where you can call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel is excluded and eradicated?
Lanzmann wrote.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own call center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this issue at the hotel administration desk.
The response he received there, according to Lanzmann, "shocked him."
The hotel clerk said the measure was a "deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel chain."
The reason behind this move caused even more anger of the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the Israeli code be removed," said Lanzmann, a hotel employee.
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the incident a "terrible disgrace," Suddeutsche zeitung reported.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible disgrace.
It is even more disgraceful that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The case caused considerable resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel had simply "gone on about" the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," said another post, which stated that the hotel, located on the glorious Kurfurstendamm Street, was next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened to drop any accusations, calling the incident "an oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel newspaper reported.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel on the fast-recruitment list," the Suddeutsche zeitung newspaper quoted a Kempinski hotel spokesman as saying.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riots began when police tried to disperse the students, causing police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
Under proposals by the governor of the state of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public high schools would be closed and 300,000 students would be redeployed to save money.
Some protesters could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against interim President Michael Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff as the country's senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran up 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Jagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian firms to do business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are resuming ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year's record for the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition," he said.
The state continues to tighten the screws in the defense-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was "systematic failure" of the instructions of the CEO of the Almaz-Antey concern, "lapses in work" and "loss of trust".
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed head of the NGO for the next three years.
Information about Neskorodov's dismissal appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause widespread resonance in the media.
How to explain such silence in the conditions of large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This once again confirms that the defense-industrial complex (OPC) has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from society.
The removal of Nekorodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of bringing order to the industry.
The NGO Almaz is the parent company of the concern, which specializes in the production of sea- and land-based anti-aircraft missile systems.
Almaz is currently working on the creation of the Poliment-Redut and Morpheus missile systems, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is caused by the failure of deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of "Morpheus" began in 2007, and commissioning was supposed to be in 2013.
"Police-Redut" should become the main air defense system on the newest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I receive, in a few years of testing, no truly successful tests have been performed.
However, as far as I can tell, there is no clear fault of "Almaz" in this," Kornev said.
The expert fears that the delay in commissioning may also occur with the S-500 missile system.
The development work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should be delivered to the troops.
The Ministry of Defense assures that "the work is carried out planned and everything will be completed in due course", although in 2014 the department acknowledged the existence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has been in charge of Almaz since 2011.
Kornev noted that delays in the timing of the projects can be both a reason and a reason for dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about internal processes in the defense industry and the plans of the management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and big money, as you know, love silence.
As a rule, directors of defense companies leave their posts of their own accord, under the agreement of the parties or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the suspension took place in public, although it did not resonate.
This suggests that the head of the "Almaz" was perhaps a figure of the shrew and resisted the "discharges" coming down from above.
Apparently, the state no longer intends to tolerate such behavior.
With the hands of shareholders, it will suspend those who prefer to argue with the installations of the Ministry of Defense and do not perform the tasks.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the snatched managers (machinations at the shipyard "Star").
The president personally pays increased attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of managers of the defense industry, seeking to have at hand a loyal staff of directors who will carry out the orders received from above.
This is far from ideal policy, but against the background of rampant corruption and lack of normal competition in the defense industry, the state does not have other tools.
The current situation in the defense industry is certainly not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates the Kremlin to put the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of managers in the defense industry, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The army's personnel gained a new quality with the arrival of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the president has adopted the famous saying "You want peace - prepare for war."
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union's military power and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which enshrined Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.
For all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
Proof of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The triumph of the "winners" in the cold war eventually led to the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world", perhaps, there is not a single quiet corner.
Despite the general trouble, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such conditions, the only allies of our country remain the navy and army.
Strengthening military power will allow Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and reach new frontiers of world politics.
Scot Callum Skinner races on the finish line, causing the Briton to grab cycling gold
Scot Callum Skinner raced to triumph in the men's team sprint at the Velodrome in Rio last night, leading the Great Britain team trio to defend their title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of the strongest, which his fellow Scot Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the youngster proudly made history by rushing down the finish line to snatch victory from the winning team-favourite from New York.
Britain claimed the right to a surprise victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Track Cycling Championships in London, despite Hoy having since finished his career.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of specialist participant Jamie Staff.
They did so just at the time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man held by British coaches, seeing potential in the Scot, which has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the norm was surpassed by New 'ealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was exactly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner backed.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hindes rode on a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep up.
Hoy watched from his seat as a guest BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the podium.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and defeated the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After triumphing in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted deliberately fell on the track after a poor start.
He later declined to comment and had no way of appealing from UK rivals.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said: "I felt like I was in London, with all those UK flags on the podium."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We've lost so many world-class races that winning the Olympics again was amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven of the 10 title races in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the velodrome will have five more successful days.
With the form demonstrated by Kenny, it's not beyond the opportunity to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in the same Games.
It would allow us to see How Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (it seems to be a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - brings his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be like Hoya's.
Next time Kenny competes in a sprint that starts today and is played for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win one, to be honest.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the only medal draw of the day, but there was good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Doull qualified for the fastest four-kilometre team pursuit race by four.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record set when winning gold at London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying race, when officials demanded that he measure his weight.
In the women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Eleanor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie improved the world record by showing a time of 4:13.260.
Team Great Britain has come to the point of relying on a mighty team of cyclists to take ownership of the middle period of the Olympics and earn a bunch of medals.
After in fact exceptional demonstrations of total superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have waned in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There have been dramas in the background, not the least - the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and harassment, and the departures of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the race of the first evening at the velodrome, it seems that Britain's now legendary glory in reaching the top at the right time may just happen again.
Future of Portland steelworks in jeopardy due to termination of electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in jeopardy because the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant's owners, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
The move follows a decision earlier this year by the Victorian government not to extend subsidies to support the plant's operation.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, could be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the steelworks consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry steelworks, leading to the closure of the Engles power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland steelworks is losing money and risking closure.
These actions were the result of reflections on the future of the plant, which has been going on for several years, initially due to the strong position of the Australian dollar, and later - because of the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expected the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contracts.
The controlling stake in the plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, a joint short-term company, while China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp own smaller stakes.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue operating, meaning that the physical demand for electricity from the steelworks will not stop," she said.
AGL said the contracts were so-called 'hedged contracts' that were due to come into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month termination period, so in fact they will end in 2017.
"Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to generate some revenue in fiscal 2017," the electricity company said.
Any potential impact on AGL's profits from the 2018 financial year is currently limited by forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its report by $187 million in terms of "impending termination."
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to manage the steelworks or supply electricity to the steelworks."
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect in November this year, but has yet to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland steelworks in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavourable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL's chief operating officer, Stephen Mikkelsen, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts of energy annually.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the electricity market.
It's going to be bad for us as a producer," he said.
Not only the Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model and the fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan," appeared on the coveted September cover of American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and has been fashion at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Being in the room with my loved ones, I looked at the cover and cried," Kendall wrote.
The news of the cover was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of "The Kardashian Family"?), prepared a reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the debauchery Rob and Caitlyn, also joined them by everyone's favorite uncle of show business, the producer of "The Kardashian Family" Ryan Seacrest), forgot about the appearance of his sister on the cover, and at the end - the classic twist: they planned a surprise party.
It's the standard storyline of almost all episodes of children's TV shows dedicated to birthday (Seacrest says the phrase: "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon bunny from the program at 8 a.m.), but Chris needed that fame to be shared with other girls anyway.
Because with this episode on the September issue of Vogue, we've certainly entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
Kendall's older sister Kim has appeared on the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling issue of the year.
Thickly similar to a gift edition than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the calculations of the portal Fashionista, 615 pages from last year's 832-page issue contained advertising).
News of which of the stars will be on its cover, expected with such impatience that in the last two years the photos of the magazine merged before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "celebrities who work as models" than "models who are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Face of the Dior brand Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga won the honor.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, whom the magazine has described as the "outstanding model" of her generation, falls into the first category, she's in good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality TV stars or modern kids who know how to make good videos on Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
These are really talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
For Beyonce, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful in her career with the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, due to her past reality TV star, should always remain shaky.
In June, one of the first Victoria's Secret models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "bitches of the moment."
Those sentiments boiled over again after news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it makes no sense to dwell on discontent.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She defiles for Marc Jacobs.
She sells you Estee Lauder tonal cream.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own apps, available on a paid subscription.
She sells her own photos of her daughter Cindy Crawford to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Kourtney and her children, she's on a reality TV show.
Community legal centres deny service to 160,000 people a year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the least protected people are denied service in community legal centres as the sector prepares for an effect that will further cut funding to an already empowered sector.
In NSW, three out of five people - mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people unable to deal with unfair dispossession, and so on - have already been turned down in an attempt to get free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already operating outside the facilities are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Community Law Centres of NSW, said thousands of people a year were being refused, according to the report of the latest census by the National Association of Community Legal Centres.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not overturned, the situation will only get worse.
"Community legal centres in NSW are consistently underfunded, which means thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need," he said.
People coming out of violent relationships, people with unmanageable and ruinous debts, families going through divorce, unfairly laid-off workers -- all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning thousands of less-protected people in NSW will be forced to tackle complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis to immediately repeal these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal challenges.
Last year, the state government met its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal centres and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Palaszczuk Government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign sued after employee allegedly threatened with gun
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's campaign office was sued after the headquarters allegedly did nothing after reports that its operations director in North Carolina threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state's campaign headquarters.
Bordini said he had waited several months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized that "it's not going to happen."
Principal Earl Phillip "removed the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed the muzzle at Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the complaint.
Complaining to the local and regional campaign headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four other people had been involved in similar incidents with Phillip, the statement said.
"The guns don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The lawsuit came just two days after the Republican presidential nominee made a splash by telling listeners in North Carolina that "second amendment people" - understood as gun owners and amateurs - could act if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and can choose judges.
Trump's campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not spoken out in support of the violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the campaign staff for negligent control, and from Phillip - for threatening physical violence, insulting by action and causing moral harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks declined to comment.
Attempts to speak to Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently resigned from the campaign.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one quickly called back.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg County Superior Court Division (Charlotte).
Britain must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring rebirth and prosperity not only in our local communities and in London as a whole, but across the country.
For me, that was the huge advantage heathrow had, just as it was with London 2012, where we did our best to ensure that our nationalities and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympic Games have been of great benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again, creating opportunities for locals and firms near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as london 2012 was before, there will be those who think the task of expanding Heathrow is too ambitious.
I have been told that Britain will never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we will find ourselves in a quandary on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will be proved wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for a narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented an 11 billion pound infrastructure investment programme on time and within budget, from T5, the airport's best terminal for five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's two busiest runways.
They are now poised to secure a third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The London 2012 Olympic Games were a huge success for the UK and I'm sure heathrow expansion will also be.
It is time for us to put the Olympic spirit on the right track and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton is chairman of Heathrow Council and former Treasury Trade Attache
Adblock Plus, Facebook play "cat and mouse" on ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, trying to bypass ad-blocking software is a cat-and-mouse game, according to one company that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site would change the bar around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now claims to have been able to bypass the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between the open source ad blocker community and those trying to get around it has been going on since the invention of ad blocking," and it's possible that Facebook will present its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social network has entered the fray is a clear sign of how big an advertising blocker has become for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to last year's Pagefair and Adobe study; almost four times the number of those who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users who visit Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue.
However, the company is hunting for desktop ad blockers because mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, according to a spokesperson.
Still, the desktop version advertising is a lucrative enough article for Facebook to consider such a move a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its "advertising preference" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook said the new Adblock filters were a concern because they would also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to address this issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Ad blockers are a rough tool, so we're focusing instead on creating tools like Advertising Preferences to put control in people's hands.
Woman moved on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide episode
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was driven by several vehicles on a motorway early on Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident happened on the A1 near Walrus in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of desperation" and was struck by several vehicles, Waugh police said in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill himself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, struck several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several of the involved drivers have already been questioned, but the identity of some has not yet been established, police said, urging them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come to a standstill.
A criminal case has been opened, a "logical" step in such a situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid being hit?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine," Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case - both involving a man walking in the dark on a freeway - a sentence was passed that motorists could not expect to accidentally meet a pedestrian on a freeway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she punched and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payern on the night of August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the female police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was driving the vehicle in a manner that was justified and that having a man on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about the incident on Thursday near Morge should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus may have once been habitable, according to estimates of NASA's new climate model.
Scientists from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to study Venus's past, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot waterless surface and atmosphere oversaturated with carbon dioxide, could ever have conditions like Earth's.
Scientists have previously assumed that the small speed of Venus's rotation is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a rarefied atmosphere similar to Earth's, and still rotate slowly.
The model also examined the topography of early Venus.
The planet was likely to have more arid regions than on Earth, but once it had enough water and enough geographic variability to create living conditions and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dim.
"According to the GISS model, Venus's slow rotation sets its daytime side to the sun for almost two months at a time," Anthony Del Henio, a scientist at GISS, explained in a press release.
This warms the planet's surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds acting like an umbrella, protecting the planet's surface from a significant portion of the solar heat.
The result is average climatic temperatures, which, surprisingly, are a few degrees colder than these days on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development, which was previously assumed by experts on the study of planets.
Although Venus may have been habitable for several billion years, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burnt by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen evaporated, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- that is, Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy stepped down as coach and vice president of hockey for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
The executive vice-president/general manager of the Colorado team Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of colorado Avalanche hockey with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
Over the summer, I spent a long and hard time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needed and elevate it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of a coach and vice president of hockey must perfectly align with the vision of the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's work.
These conditions have not been met at this time.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has lost the playoffs the last two years.
The Avalanche team declared a 39-39-4 score for the 2015-2016 season and are five points behind the Wild in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goalie, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two each with the Montreal Canadiens and with avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks and suspend strike
Workers' strikes on oil workers' salaries in the North Sea have been suspended and all sides of the discussions are embarking on a new round of talks, leading representatives of the parties said.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve ongoing disputes," the joint statement said.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
Unions said their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was aimed at potential pay cuts of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group has cut rates paid to contract workers working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent this year because of negative market tensions.
The company's rate cut comes after a 10 per cent rate cut for contract workers on the board in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it the space it needs to overcome the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of people and announced plans to end oil and gas operations in the country of up to 10, as it rationalizes its activities due to its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure over lower crude oil prices, with the economic situation deteriorating due to the uk's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest Labour conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to the average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The kepler space telescope's latest mission helped astronomers compile the most comprehensive catalog of the rotational speeds of the stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how the rotational periods correlate with the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stellar clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the star's mass, its age and even the history of its solar system," Louise Riball, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology, said in a press release.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They rotate as fast as they will never again.
At their peak speeds, these rising stars emit large amounts of stellar wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have a inhibitory effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The newest catalog of rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than smaller stars.
Riball compares stars with dancers: larger pirouettes are slower than smaller ones.
"In Pleiades, we see that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, whereas those that rotate faster usually belong to very light stars," Riball said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with rotational speeds.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of star rotation, both younger and older," Riball said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, where and why stars slow down the speed of their rotation and hang their "dance shoes" on the nail, figuratively speaking.
Riball and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the speeds of the Pleiades rotation in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation related to the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea is being conducted by two agencies, Kommersant writes.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of sabotage in Crimea.
As previously reported, the confessions were given by a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar Yevgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, he considered the "Titan" chemical plant in Armenia, the oil depot in Theodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields as objects for sabotage.
Law enforcement officials believe that not all accomplices of saboteurs were detained.
This, in particular, was the reason for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev District Court of Simferopol, the newspaper notes.
Stanislav Cherchesov became the head coach of the Russian national football team
At the meeting of the executive committee of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with him will be for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the RFU executive committee appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as head coach of the Russian national football team.
He is a well-known footballer who previously played for Spartak Moscow as a goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was a mentor of such Russian teams as the same Spartak, Pearl-Sochi, Terek, Amkar, Dynamo, as well as Warsaw Legia, which won the national championship and the cup of the country.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the near future and is designed for two years.
Thus, it is he who has the duty to prepare the national team for the World Championship 2018.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Pannikov.
There is information according to which the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to media reports, the leadership of the RFU set a goal for Stanislav Cherchesov to bring the Russian team to the semifinals and win medals.
As stated by the coach, as a priority he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and is going to give the players an opportunity to prove themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under Cherchesov's leadership will be played on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly match with the Turkish team.
Earlier, Leonid Slutsky, who combined him with coaching at CSKA, was the head coach of the Russian national football team.
He announced his resignation after the failed performance of the Russian national team at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor result of the national team on himself.
Sandwiched between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
Nevertheless, since independence from South Africa in 1990, this country of 2.4 million people has made great strides, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the Government places great emphasis on education.
While people in developed countries take free primary and secondary education for granted, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce training fees to "reimburse costs."
In Namibia, however, primary school is free.
Moreover, secondary education has become free since 2015.
The country's authorities are also actively working on other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97% over the past decade.
Contrary to the international trend of rising inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini coefficient, a standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
And the poverty rate has fallen from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) also fell, from almost 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest free speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country is well ahead of the United States and other wealthy nations.
In addition, the country has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Corruption Perceptions Index" which is compiled by human rights activists from Transparency International.
Even as commodity prices fall, Namibia has managed to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25%, less than one-third of the debt level in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia also has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least in traditional assessment methods, is still quite high, at almost 28 per cent.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high incidence of HIV/AIDS, with almost 17% of the population infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is an above-average country with above-average incomes, but the authorities insist that their state is in fact a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
The country's deserts are inhabited by isolated nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes, which in one way or another must be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: just like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think to give up, the country solves the problems it faces.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap health care not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20% of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbours.
Namibians realized that they did not choose their neighbors, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to encourage investment and exchange of students.
Furthermore, the Government of Namibia has rightly judged that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that the proceeds of Namibia's natural resources need to be invested in infrastructure and production facilities.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum profits from the sale of the country's resources, and are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to make sure this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, which is why the government's strong support for free speech is so important.
As the head of state Hage Geingob noted, the media often say things that he does not like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend its freedoms, the president says.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are exhausted.
Some - such as fisheries - are renewable, and the government is working hard to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even countries that begin with serious flaws - racism, colonialism, inequality and low levels of development - can embark on the path to shared prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the "Gold of Varna" - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps it was the most high-profile archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during excavations of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilograms - was found.
Only one burial site, known as "grave number 43", extracted 990 gold items with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world's oldest gold may soon turn to a nondescript-looking bead found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunacite.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tell Yunacite is located away from the sea, near the village of Yunacite in the Pazardzhik district.
The beads are a golden strip rolled into a ring.
Yavor Boyadzhiev, head of excavations at Tella Yunacit, dated the find 4600 BC and stated that it was at least 200 years older than Varna's gold.
Varna's treasures date back to about the same period, 4600 - 4200 BC.
There are currently no technologies to date the metal with impeccable accuracy.
How does it take to have confidence in which gold is older?
Apparently, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I am quite sure that Yunacite gold is older than Varna gold."
This is a find of extreme importance: it looks like a tiny object, but it is large enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiev said that in the near future scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re-and more thoroughly study the archaeological site where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bead as accurately as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell Yunacite is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Currently, Tell Yunacite is considered the oldest "city" of Europe.
Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
Over the following centuries, metals processing developed rapidly in the region, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the national historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC around the centers of metal processing began to emerge settlements of urban type.
Now they are called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunacite is probably the oldest, as artifacts from 4900 BC were found here.
I would call Tell Yunacite a prototype of a modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is a thousand years older than Schumer," Boyadzhiev says, referring to the conventional wisdom that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the usual sense of the word.
Excavations of Tella Yunacite have been going on since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortified wall, which once reached three meters in height, were found.
Little has been preserved from houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, urban dense buildings, "business center" and residential suburbs.
Tell Yunacite is often called the "Bird City": dozens of clay figurines of birds were found here.
All birds are depicted at rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but the object of the local cult.
The "Bird City" was destroyed around 4100 BC - perhaps by Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
Nomads had no cities, but there were horses and weapons.
The three-meter walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of brutal carnage: the remains of elderly people, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by battle axes were found inside the houses.
New findings and new facts appear every year, changing the usual ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive in the search for this civilization was the "gold of Varna" found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that Varna's golden luxury had to precede something - something like a tiny golden bead created in Tell Yunacit.
Porsche artificially aged the 911 Targa
It is officially stated that the preparation of the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by the unit's specialists who work with production machines.
"Retro-onion" is, for example, in a special body color Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the porsche 356B - even the logo of the model is painted in this color.
In addition, the targa received branded white graphics along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheels, as well as some body design details painted in "white-gold metallic".
The interior of retro-features is noticeably less: it differs, by and large, gray-blue range of design, new chairs with extended ranges of electrical adjustments and trimmed black anodized steel rapids with the logo of the unit.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive as a gift a car case and an ornate album with photos of the production process.
The Porsche Exclusive specialists did not touch the power plant: the retro-targa on the characteristics is quite identical to the serial one.
It is powered by a six-cylinder 3.0-liter turbocharged engine, developing 420 hp and 500 nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in a limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each particular sports car is reported.
Facebook and ad blockers unleashed an "arms race"
The recent introduction of Facebook technology, which prevented the hiding of advertising on the pages of the social network, provoked developers of solutions to block ads to retaliade.
AdBlock Plus has released an "antidote," but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus advertised its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
Representatives of the social network noted that in an effort to cheat the new technology of "unblockable" advertising, the solution from AdBlock Plus along with commercial ads blocks many ordinary posts from friends or pages.
Facebook expressed regret for this policy AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
According to a source among the developers of the social network to TechCrunch, the code that renders AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop site Facebook will be ready in the next few hours.
Thus, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of "arms race", trying to beat each other, the affected side were users who missed interesting recordings from friends or saw advertising where they are not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of ad blocking have been hotly debated in recent times.
Rapist to stand trial in Murmansk Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been investigated by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation on the Murmansk region.
The charge against a 54-year-old man is very serious - committing sexual violence.
The investigation found that in late November 2015, the accused in the area of Pavlova Street in Murmansk committed acts of a sexual nature with violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The sanction of this article provides for a maximum penalty of up to six years' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia a crossvan Fengguang 370 and a pickup truck Rich New - the site behind the wheel www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 - a representative of the growing popularity in China class of cars, combining the virtues of a minivan and a crossover.
Another stated Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup truck.
Many Western firms of the Moscow International Auto Show this year decided to ignore, so the void of exhibition halls "Crocus Expo" will fill Chinese firms.
In particular, Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has great views of the Russian market and intends to offer our motorists a number of interesting new products in the near future, will be a powerful front.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossvan, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (just under 550,000 rubles at the current rate).
Russians are unlikely to see such a price tag, and the issue of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 at the end of June sales managed to get to the 11th place in the list of best-selling minivans, although due to the large road clearance (175 mm) and protective plastic bodying on the lower perimeter of the body it can be attributed to crossovers.
The cross-van is built on the front-wheel-drive platform of the younger Fengguang 360, the 370th has the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm vs. 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden planks, but the large vertical touch screen shown in the photo "like Tesla' on the central console was only on the early exhibition copies of the crossvan, and the sale came cars with "music" easier.
Five of the seven seats are easily folded, forming a flat loading area of 1650 mm length, the maximum volume of the trunk - 1500 liters.
The engine for the Fengguang 370 is provided only one - 1.5-liter gasoline "atmospheric" with a capacity of 115 hp, docked with a 5-speed manual transmission.
The manufacturer modestly keeps quiet about the dynamic qualities of the machine, but promises a sparing budget of the owner's appetite at the level of 6.7 liters/100 km.
The Rich New pickup truck is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara of the previous generation, but with a slightly ennobled Chinese stylist design.
Despite the obsolete design, this model is still in stable demand among the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious "workhorse".
At a similar price Rich New is sure to interest russians, because modern Japanese pickup trucks have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: a petrol 2.4 hp (137 hp) or a 2.5 litre turbodiesel (116 hp).
The gearbox is only a mechanic, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a hard-connected "front".
There will be a new flagship A9 sedan at the Dongfeng stand, its Russian premiere was announced in June.
Minvan-like crossovers in the Chinese market is becoming more and more, one of the latest innovations - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng line consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the hatchback H30 Cross.
In the first seven months of this year, dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Notices on transport tax will stop sending in the mail - the site behind the wheel www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the way property tax notices are sent.
All Russian car owners are used to the scheme that has not changed over the years: in the summer and autumn they receive in the mail receipts for payment of transport tax for the previous year.
However, this year many of them will not wait.
The fact is that the tax inspectorate has changed the order of notification of citizens without unnecessary noise.
Those who are registered in the "Personal Taxpayer's Office" on the official website of the nalog.ru department, notifications will come electronically.
The inspection automatically considered such Russians online users and struck them out of the standard, "paper" mailing.
The innovation will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will still receive the usual letters.
However, the opportunity to return to the old scheme is also available to account holders on the site.
To do this, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write an application.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after the compilation, while the letter will go several days and may be lost altogether.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax office exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the agency to save significantly on mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some could register in a "personal office" to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notifications by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the ensuing consequences.
Access to the "Personal Taxpayer's Office" is carried out in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, through electronic signature or input of the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person at any branch of the tax office (regardless of the place of registration).
We remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid by December 1.
Notifications began in July.
The tuning Mercedes-Benz G-Class, in which the refinements are aimed at achieving a very high return, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the masters of the company G-Power, who took up the modification of the sports version of Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human to its masters is alien.
Indeed, why not upgrade the G 63 - a 571-strong flying sledgehammer with the aerodynamics of the tank and acceleration to a hundred in 5.4 s?
Pumping up the "muscles" of the crazy "helik", the masters took advantage of the 5.5-liter supercharged "eight".
But the dynamics of acceleration to a hundred has improved on indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "brick" is capable of a spurt for 5.3 s.
However, accelerations from medium speeds are certainly given to him noticeably better.
The speed ceiling is intimidating: if the standard G 63 is faster than 210 km/h does not drive, the tuning all-roader with a deactivated electronic "collar" is able to squeeze 250 km/h.
Outside, the car is almost indistinguishable from its factory original, except for other wheels - 23-inch Hurricane RR measuring 305/35 zR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach luxury division has announced a striking 6m-long concept coupe to be presented as part of the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the "green sub-brand" BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand.
At least four eco-friendly innovations are expected to be produced in the coming years.
