India also reportedly hopes for an agreement on defence cooperation between the two countries.
Fano of Russia to hold final Expert Session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with the Russian Academy of Sciences will hold the third Expert Session "Assessment of the effectiveness of scientific organizations."
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, according to a press release received by Lenta.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to sum up the results of the Expert Session for the year and to form a final list of indicators to assess the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Separately, the participants of the event plan to discuss the rules of the formation of expert groups responsible for assessing the work of scientific groups, and the criteria for conducting evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events to form a unified approach for all three academies to assess the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months we have succeeded, and the final version of the regulations is under negotiation.
At the end of the next session, we should complete the formation of the processes of science and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment," said the head of the expert and analytical department of the Russian FANO Elena Aksenova.
Representatives of more than a hundred scientific institutes of Russia will take part in the event.
As a result, a resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow City, Solyanka Street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneity in stellar clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow to look among the stars related, that is, originated from a single cluster.
The results of their research were published in the journal Nature, and briefly available on the university's website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of the nearby stars is the turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas, preceding the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of star-relatives.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster can lead to differences in its chemical content from that in relatives in the cluster.
The results of the simulations conducted by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, the experts simulated two streams of interstellar gas using a supercomputer, which together formed a cloud.
This object for several million years under the influence of its own gravity is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added paint tags to the original gas streams and found that rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud achieves a high degree of chemical homogeneity.
According to astrophysicists, their research proves that it is possible to look for stars-relatives by chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions of formation of such objects.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old after pursuit of motorbike at high speed
The motorbike was impounded after it drove at 125km/h in a 70km/h high-speed zone and through a bushland to escape police in the Pilbara.
A transport police patrol in Karratha this morning tried to stop the blue motorbike after discovering it was speeding at 125km/h as it drove off the service station on Bathgate Road.
Police say the motorcyclist did not stop and continued on Burgess Road, then swerved into the bushland, causing police to lose sight of him.
A motorbike and a man matching the driver's description were seen near a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police charged a 20-year-old man with failure to stop and dangerous driving.

Lavrov: Russia will not "slam the door" due to new sanctions and will not withdraw from the WTO
Russia will not "slam the door" in connection with the new sanctions.
This was stated today by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
As for our response in case of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even speculate, fantasize, because everything should be calculated concretely," he said.
And when we understand what the European and American partners will like to do, then we will make decisions about how to respond.
This will not be connected with the slamming of doors, some grievances, falsely understood, - the minister stressed.
First of all, we will start from our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of partners on their adequacy, contractual capacity and reliability.
According to the steps taken in the area of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what the partners are trying to achieve, - the Russian Foreign Minister continued.
If they say in full voice that "they will be painful for us too, but we have to go to it to punish Russia" - it is probably not very adequate."
As for the WTO, Russia's exit in response to possible new sanctions, no.
On the contrary, we want to actively master the WTO tools, including when it comes to trade disputes," Lavrov said.
We have already used this toolkit to overcome what we believe is the EU's discriminatory anti-dumping policy.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and at the same time anti-dumping measures are used against the sectors of the Russian economy.
"We are ready to use WTO mechanisms in order to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the norms of the third EU energy package retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How to use lilac in the design of the garden?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since lilac loses its main appeal after flowering, it is desirable to plant it together with other shrubs.
It goes well with many cultures.
And next to lilac can and should be planted as plants, decorative in other terms, and blooming at the same time.
Another plus of lilac is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stamp tree of different heights, an improved bush, a bush with a wide base and even a similar garden bonsai - a tree with a bizarrely curved trunk.
Just choose the shape that is more consistent with the design of your garden.
A resident of the Leningrad region was convicted for selling counterfeit money in Karelia
According to the republican Interior Ministry, the man was engaged in his criminal trade in the Olonetskoye and Segezh districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other parts of the country.
In particular, the accused has already managed to inherit in Vologda region, where this spring he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
The man later appeared before the Olonets District Court.
And to end the investigation into crimes committed in our republic, was staged in Segejo.
The investigation has proved to be guilty of several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money dating back to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the materials of the criminal case with the indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court ruled to replace the term of imprisonment for four years with serving in a general regime colony.
The sentence has not entered into legal force.
Recall that last week two more sellers of counterfeit money, who were paid by them in the stores of Petrozavodsk, were convicted.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them was imprisoned for five years, the other for four years.
Each was fined 500,000 rubles.
The sentence has also not yet entered into legal force.
The 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish" was celebrated in Arkhangelsk
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervish delivered military aid from the United States and Great Britain to the USSR.
In Arkhangelsk, a remembrance rally was held at the foundation stone to the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedov embankment in Solombal.
Representatives of Arkhangelsk veterans' organizations and children from the cadet class gathered for the event.
We first met twenty-three years ago, when the mortgage stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who have not been returned by the sea," said Boris Karpov, chairman of the Northern Maritime Shipping Board's Veterans Council.
Then the city brass band performed at the event, and the pupils of the cadet classes presented the veterans with flowers and marched with the flags of Russia and the victory banner.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers to the stone mortgage.
The convoy itself consisted of five British ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of uniformed boots, tin, wool and many other equipment and equipment).
In addition, there were military equipment and weapons on board - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Hurricane fighters, disassembled.
At the same time, the escort convoy consisted of 16 ships of the Royal Navy, including two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of ships was not discovered by the enemy and safely reached its destination - Arkhangelsk.
A total of 126 transport and about 50 warships were killed out of 848 ships taking part in vital caravan operations.

Remembering the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill that would protect union organizing as a civil right.
"Where there are unions, there are middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota who is co-chair of the Progressive Caucus Congress.
That's why I'm proud to present the Workers' Rights Act, along with the civil rights symbol John Lewis.
This groundbreaking bill will give workers the same legal opportunity to discriminate against union organizations as in other forms of discrimination, stopping opponents of trade unions
Changing the Labour Regulation Act to allow workers facing discrimination for participating in unionization to seek justice in civil courts - and receive damages and punitive payments - is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
But this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the co-sponsors of the bill are proposing is to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that unions have suffered in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - Americans once supported countries around the world in accepting, expanding and respecting labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that hideki Tojo's paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in the formation of the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize, negotiate, and collective action is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and heard in a new state, the Germans included an article that openly read: "The right to form associations to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe on this right will not be legally binding; measures aimed at these purposes will be considered illegal.
When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chairwoman of the International Human Rights Commission, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948 would be adopted by the United Nations as a world agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have taken for granted the basic position that labour rights are human rights.
When that country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and for the union to participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.
At a time when these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the strength of the nation, but increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers, as it should be, and to us.
Official recognition of labour rights as a human right - and increased protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against union organization - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reviving the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
Judge temporarily blocks law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the enactment of a Louisiana law that his supporters say would likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under the measure, which was signed into law by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jinadle in June and was supposed to take effect on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have the authority to admit patients to a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while continuing to seek such powers.
"Plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing to obtain authority," Justice John deGrevells wrote in his decision.
A hearing will be scheduled within a month, at which the judge will make a more permanent decision on the law.
Abortion rights advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to get hospital powers.
"Today's decision ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from a treacherous law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who did not act as plaintiffs in the case and also applied for admission authority.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, and courts recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have shut down most of the remaining clinics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion rights advocates, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admission laws impose restrictions on physicians that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion object that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some have also noted their positive effects in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has the authority to take care of a hospital, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor would stop performing the procedure, the group said.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not penalize abortion doctors while their applications for admission are pending.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of goods in the range of retail chains should be Russian-made, said Oleg Nilov, a member of the State Duma from the "Just Russia" faction.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, Izvestia newspaper reports.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not manufactured in Russia. <...> For the rest of the groups of products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic manufacturers," Nilov told the publication.
Together with amendments to the article "On the basics of state regulation of trade activities in Russia" the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code, setting a reduced VAT rate of 10% when selling products produced in Russia.
The idea to introduce a 50% quota in retail chains is part of the incentive package for Russian manufacturers.
On the shelves will appear several times more domestic goods.
However, the initiative can have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.
According to Sergei Litvinenko, a lawyer for Taxovik, a member of the independent expert center "Public Duma" for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
In the plus will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means that the profit will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate to retailers their terms and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian manufacturers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will lead to the payment of higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some are faster to develop, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, however, not immediately," the expert notes.
Previously, Russian enterprises often could not break into the shelves of local stores because of the high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now, after the embargo, this niche has been liberated and it is possible to breathe a sigh of relief.
But we should not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary checks on the Russian market will receive food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.
In other words, now is the "moment of calm" when the former players have already left, and the new ones have not yet arrived.
After almost a month we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the increase in prices for finished products," Tamara Kasyanova, first vice-president of the Russian public organization "Russian Club of Financial Directors", told AIF.ru.
Definitely, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will allow to consolidate the sector for local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods, which are cheaper due to subsidies from another state.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will unfold between companies operating under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian manufacturers are able to meet 50% of the internal needs of compatriots not on all counts.
And in this situation, the retail chains will have to "reach" the share of Russian goods to half of the range.
In this regard, there are growing fears that the shelves will receive substandard goods.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be supplied under the guise of produced in Russia," the expert adds.
Large trade networks, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers, will feel the negative effect of the introduction of quotas.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will suffer in this situation, as the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods can affect consumers as well.
The fact is that some products of Russian production can yield on the quality of imported counterparts, while stores will be able to inflate prices for the second, as a scarce commodity.
Economists started talking about the idea of import substitution forgotten in the early 2000s in February of this year because of the continuous devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the background of difficult relations with the West, the issue of abandoning imported products is becoming even more urgent.
The law is intended to oblige retailers to take into account domestic manufacturers when forming orders.
Then we will take the path of import substitution much faster and more confidently, and the system of planning production for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time frame," said MP Oleg Nilov.
A quota mechanism would be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential was particularly high, for example in the dairy industry, where imports accounted for 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to completely cover the shelves of Russian shops.
In addition, meat production can get a strong boost.
As you know, the largest share of imports is saved by beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% is still accounted for by Russian products," Kasyanova said.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will contribute to import substitution and can speed up the process.
However, this initiative will not lead to import substitution by itself, as it requires a set of measures, Litvinenko believes.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be brought from abroad, which means that there will be no full-fledged import substitution, but significant steps in this direction will be made.
In addition, it is not enough to set quotas, it is necessary to establish the production of domestic products in the country in order to meet these quotas.
These quotas will provide such guarantees," the expert says.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video of their late mother's memory, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who work in rural Australia face a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers analysed disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that just 35 per cent had lived five years after being diagnosed.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the Institute of Medical Research of the iMR Berghofer reported that those who live in regions and remote areas of the state are 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those who live in urban areas.
READ MORE: New drugs may slow lung cancer and ovarian cancer
Researchers traced the women's medical pathway for seven years.
Dr Jordan said the woman's age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socioeconomic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those with cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
While the study was not intended to determine why women living outside cities were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr Jordan suggested that late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly found in big cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of out-of-home services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home, and support programs for people undergoing treatment far from their home, could help.
Dr Jordan said that regardless of geographic location, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, highlighting the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young Gold Coast mother, Elisha Neave, was told she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, the new FAP will open its doors in the Kuzhener district
Construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaybelak was started in April this year and was carried out on a model project.
The cost of the works was just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Office of Public Relations and Information of the Head of Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the national budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the facility built is almost 230 square meters.
It will provide medical assistance to residents of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaybelak and the villages of Dementyevo, Puenciukal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraibeljak, Shinur and Chakayal.
The new midwifery station will replace the existing AFP, whose building was built in 1918 and has long since exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet sanitary requirements.
The new facility will open soon.
Four-month-old son who killed four-month-old son in drunken state of Novocheboxer to stand trial
A resident of Chuvashia will be in the dock for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksary, the investigation of the criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by negligence, has been completed.
The investigation found that on July 26 this year, the accused, together with her four-month-old son, came to Cheboksary to celebrate the birthday of her idol's child.
After a long feast, the new-decker decided to stay away and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, a drunk woman put him next to her on the bed to breastfeed, but soon fell asleep.
During the sleep, the woman fell on her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, according to the press service of the SKR SU on Chuvashia, was sent to the court.
Inflation came out of vacation.
Will Russians feel a sharp rise in prices
As a result of cross-sanctions of Russia and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not meet the forecasts of the authorities, analysts of VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the postponed consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, RBC Daily writes.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year and even less - 6.5%.
However, according to Kommersant newspaper, this week the IER should make "small but principled" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the newspaper, the agency can lower the estimate of inflation for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zeroing of income growth of the population.
The forecast assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation are valid for a year - until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be assumed in such a situation?
The current situation assumes a one-time shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," said the source of the newspaper in the Ministry of Finance.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the financial and economic bloc of the government regarding inflation and forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.
The main effect of food bans will come together with the possible introduction of a sales tax (NSP) in the regions of Russia in 2015, experts are convinced.
Inflation peak of 9% will be in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will decline, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflationary results after Russia imposed "careful sanctions."
AIF.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department of AForex FC:
Price growth is already observed in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially important products began to become more expensive, the Government was forced to launch measures of systemic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unreasonable price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators to let the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason initiates price increases.
The main factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the enormous rate of capital outflows, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressures remained under control, the value of a basket of minimum products would not have jumped by 12% in a quarter alone.
The ban on the import of food products provoked a shock of supply in the domestic market and led to a perfectly logical increase in the final cost.
Since at the current stage we are not able to fully launch the import substitution mechanism, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, retaliatory sanctions will continue to carry risks of growth of the inflation component.
If we add here also the fiscal reasons associated with the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the worsened prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year inflation may well exceed 8%.
Alexander Razuvayev, Director of Alpari's Analytical Department
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, in zero it was also above the current level, another thing that then it was compensated by rapid economic growth.
I think at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Plato Maguta, Asset Manager, Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is still successfully restrained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, first of all, on the financial sector - it can lead to some difficulties and increase inflation expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally manifested in purchases of cash in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to soften the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But price growth begins traditionally after the summer lull and may become more tangible this autumn.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5% is likely to stand, as Russia has more financial savings.
Gardening centres are saddened by the decline in the number of homeowners
The fall, driven by an exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could lead to gardening centres losing tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach the "basic age of gardening," according to an HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to the report, people renting spend on average 55 per cent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on gardening.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of paving yards in front of the house for parking and the reduction of garden sizes as other threats to the industry, whose annual sales are estimated to be 5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the UK has the lowest level of spending on household goods.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society reported that renting and lack of space for a garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticulture adviser at rhS, said: "Growing plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of gardening retailing as a result of the increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year thanks to better weather after unfavourable conditions in March and April last year.
Bulgaria's Ministry of Agriculture Conducts Mass Cleansing at Agriculture Fund
Three of the four bosses of the "Agriculture" fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four chiefs of the "Agriculture" fund were replaced on Friday.
Officially, Bulgaria's Ministry of Agriculture announced only the dismissal of Executive Director Atanas Dobrev.
He was replaced by Lozan Vasileva.
It turned out that two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were quietly replaced on Friday.
Deputy Executive Director Tatiana Angelova, who until then was responsible for state aid and the SAPARD program, was released, BGNES reported, citing the Trud newspaper.
I was not present at the board of fund managers because by law we are not members of management, but I was informed later that I was released.
I can't say why my dismissal is not reported on the foundation's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to find out more on Monday," Angelova told the newspaper.
She will be replaced by Ivanka Baghdatova, who until now was the head of Investment Lending at the Central Fund in "Agriculture" in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolay Dachev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
In his place will be appointed by Yivko Jivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the "Agriculture" Foundation in the city of Veliko-Tyrnovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the fund, Atije Aliyeva-Veli, retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey summons U.S. diplomat over espionage report
Turkey's foreign ministry has summoned the country's highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to explain the report on U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. attorney general and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying all the leading countries were spying on each other.
Earlier reports that Germany's main intelligence agency had also made Ankara an intelligence target provoked a more angry response from the Turkish government.
China's largest companies unite against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China's largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (social media, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
However, catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which left behind even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
The Union's largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of it will be owned by Wanda and 15% each of the Internet companies, Wanda Group said in a statement.
The company is scheduled to be registered in Hong Kong.
The JV will combine Baidu's search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China with a total of about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda Infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial properties across China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and theme park in Tsingtao (a city in eastern China on the shores of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its shopping malls, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the newly created competitor Alibaba.
According to Dong Tse, who will lead the new company, thanks to the merger, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new site should become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, Dong Tse notes.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract customers online so that they come to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is coupon services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest "pie" in online commerce," said Wanda CEO Wang Jianlin (quoted by Bloomberg).
"Right now, there is no real O2O site in China, and in this situation the chances are approximately equal to that of everyone," he said.
The Chinese online trading market is the largest in the world, and According to McKinsey's estimates, its volume will more than triple by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, Bloomberg quotes official statistics: it is more than the population of any country in the world, except India.
And it is predicted that by 2015 this number could grow to 850 million people.
The Union of the Richest
Tencent CEO Ma Huaten was until recently China's richest man, but according to Bloomberg's Millionaires Index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already overtaken him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion comes from his stake in Alibaba.
Baidu's chief executive Robin Li is now third among China's richest men, while Wanda's Wang Jianlin is fourth in the rankings.
"It's very interesting to see this battle: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge the even richer," Cao Lei, director of the China E-Commerce Research Center in Hangzhou, told Bloomberg.
But he believes the new company is unlikely to be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately after its creation: "Rome cannot be built in one day."
The fact that it is not so easy to compete with Alibaba not only new companies, but also honored leaders of the world Internet trade, is evidenced by the report published the day before on the financial performance of Alibaba for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as a cross between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June the Chinese company earned more than both of its U.S. rivals combined.
Alibaba's net profit for the period is almost double that of its competitors - it nearly tripled year-on-year to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has huge potential to generate money, thanks in large part to its mobile applications," an analyst at Hong Kong's Arete Research Service told Bloomberg.
According to the updated Alibaba prospectus on the website of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July amounted to 188 million, which is significantly higher than the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba will name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the share sale.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may take place as early as September 16.
The company's road show, preceded by this event, will start on September 3.
Alibaba's IPO is expected to be the highest in NYSE history and will allow the company to raise about $20 billion.
So far, the record for the amount of funds raised on the U.S. exchanges belonged to the payment system Visa, which in 2008 held an initial public offering of its shares, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of food products in retail chains should be Russian-made, according to State Duma deputies.
They drafted a bill on the subject.
We are talking about amending Article 8 of the "On the Basics of State Regulation of Trade Activities in Russia" and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of domestically produced products in stores should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in winter, so they will be made a "discount" to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Russian Tax Code, which sets a reduced VAT rate of 10% in the sale of all food products, the country of origin of which is Russia, Izvestia newspaper reports.
On August 27, a draft law on changes to the Retail Markets Fund was introduced in the lower house of parliament, which proposes to revive the farmers' markets in Russia, where small producers will be able to sell their products.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the public prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The police chief of Calvia on the resort island of Mallorca has been arrested after being accused of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the infamous Magaluf drinking centre.
Chief Inspector Jose Antonio Navarro was remanded in custody following corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the daily online publication Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca anti-corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard on corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say that protectionism by the authorities seriously affects the state of their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about surviving," one businessman told the court.
Our livelihoods cannot be compromised.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines in the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showed an 18-year-old British holidaymaker blow 24 men during a bar race.
Authorities on the island have since been trying to stop drunken hooliganism among Magaluf holidaymakers, minimizing the number of infamous alcohol runs on bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club where the incident occurred was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage Bar Race together were fined €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular with young British holidaymakers, has also been the site of numerous alcohol-intoxicating accidents associated with the insane fun known as "balconing" when people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into a hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights at Adelaide Airport
A COLD surprise has arrived in southern South Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5mm of rain fell on the city in the evening by 9 p.m., following the 6.6mm fall over Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short showers with gusty winds, including a thunderstorm that started shortly before 8pm and poured in almost 4mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter gave out an early portion of spring last week, temperatures again dropped on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city.
The squalling conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay in boarding a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land on schedule just after 7.30pm, but hit the wind shear zone - a sudden change in speed or wind direction at short range - and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts were as high as 50km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including Emirates flight from Dubai and flight zantas from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is forecast in Adelaide on Tuesday with the chance of one or two showers.
The calculation of the estimates of construction sites in Russia will take place in a new way
The Federal Antitrust Service takes special control over pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems of connection to networks.
The FAS has established an expert council to develop competition in the construction sector.
At his meeting, Vadim Solovyov, head of the FAS's housing, construction and natural resources control department, said that "today's calculation of the estimates of construction sites is completely incomprehensible."
Regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to unreasonable construction price, according to the FAS.
And they propose the cost of construction of state property facilities at the design stage to determine on the basis of market prices constructive solutions instead of the current estimates and single prices for technological operations.
These proposals have been put on the road map and are currently under consideration in the Ministry of Construction.
"Replacing the traditional estimated documentation in construction with the calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry," Vadim Solovyov explained to RGB.
After all, now the estimate counts every bolt and nut, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation unscrupulous construction companies can bury "whole tractors."
The Ministry agrees with the FAS.
"The first developments on the transition to the calculation of the cost by structural elements are already there: methods have been developed to calculate prices for constructive solutions, to draw up estimates on these indicators," the head of the department of urban planning and architecture of the Ministry of Construction Elena Shchukova told RGB.
Road construction has been selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
Anatoly Demjanko, head of the profi-invest construction company, told RGB that the estimates are out of date, but no other mechanism has been proposed for business.
"As for the proposed calculations on structural elements, in practice it is difficult to implement, as the construction of buildings often uses completely different technologies," he said.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing largely due to the state order.
According to Ekaterina Lezina, chairman of the board of the Expert Community of State Order Professionals, the state is now the most solvent customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, deputy director of engineering at Rosatom's industrial capital construction center, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to the portfolio of contracts, and companies that have monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors to enter the field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is protected from someone's management influence as much as possible.
At the expert council it was proposed to form a system of state order in such a way that the same executor is not entitled to receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts worth more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of the impact on business, as well as the efficiency of construction management.
As explained by Elena Shchukova, in this case it will be necessary to give the customer the functions of a general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the staffing of the customer and budgetary expenses for its maintenance.
At the same time, the customer's specialists will have to have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by contractors, as well as their safety.
Often, this breakdown will require determining who will be responsible for the security of the object as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to an outflow of highly qualified public procurement participants due to the lack of interest in obtaining a government order for incomplete work and a small amount of contract.
Alexander Evstashenkov, deputy head of the expert advisory center of the Institute of Procurement, believes that now the procedure of the state order has turned into a business game for the care of the contractor.
And he gave this example: "a participant should specify "specific indicators" without specifying the words "or equivalent" when filling out an application, "should be," "from," "more," "less," "similar," "or," "type," "similar type," "no lower," "below," "may," "may have," "maybe," "earlier," "no earlier," "no higher," "not allowed, etc.
Customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of an application submitted by contractors.
Another problem 44-Fz, according to Evstashenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work through the "paper" proposal of the participant at the application stage.
Considering the application of the participant, it is really possible to evaluate only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of work, which has not even started, - the expert believes.
The quality of the work can be assessed only when they are accepted.
The expert council also proposed to move the marginal income from the upper to the lower echelon, so that the intermediate contractors would disappear.
Chairman of the expert council, State Secretary, deputy head of FAS Andrei Tsarikovskiy believes that this should not be done, as the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise it will turn out, as in Arkady Raikin's famous reprise "Atelier": "Is there a claim to the buttons?".
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mines rained down on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the territory recovered from the fighting.
The start of school hours brought a sense of joy and excitement to the missile-affected settlements of southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff at the Pashosh kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed traces of shrapnel from walls and children's slides before the students came.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited about the future," said Ronit Barth, a Kibbutz Saad resident and English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Barth, said it was "a little weird" to start going back to school.
"It was a difficult time and we didn't leave their homes at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz, which is located near the Border with Gaza, to express his support.
Before the cease-fire stopped the war last week, thousands of border residents such as Saad did not go outside or fled their homes to safer areas further from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should go back.
The Department for Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the border with Gaza that has been hit hard by Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study diligently and said, "We will do everything we can to give you knowledge and ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The cease-fire immediately put an end to the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas' demand to lift the Egypt-Israel blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
A new phase of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians have been killed in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this allegation.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged and destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in more than 100 schools that have been converted into shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and fighting continuing, education officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon open so that we can complete our education as children around the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a Gaza school.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices showed the largest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index for house prices in the Australian capital rose 1.1 per cent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase led to a cumulative increase for June, July and August of 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth was 10.9 percent, more than double the 12 months to August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne were leading a two-tier market.
Figures from RP Data show Sydney house prices have risen 16.1 per cent in the past year, while Melbourne's has an 11.7 per cent rise.
The next most powerful markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five to six per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which has seen government spending cuts rise by just 1.4 per cent for the year.
Mr Lawless said there would now be an increase in the number of properties for sale over the next few months, which would be a "real test" for the market.
"Given the current high rate of auction sales, overall high sales rates and current conditions with low interest rates, it is likely that the cost of housing will still rise over the next three months," he said.
How people live in Ufa's oldest house
In the former house of gold miners and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (formerly Big Kazan) 18 apartments.
The 18th-century house has hardly changed since the construction, except for the dilapidation.
Outsiders go here as a tour, and the tenants suffer more than rejoice, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufa house, the walls of which remember the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is almost 300 years old.
The old yard, always the open door, the creaking staircase.
Doors to the apartments are located close to each other, the walls cracked, and in the gaps from the peeling plaster in some places the street is visible.
I think it's all about being honest.
And the locals say, "You don't think that's the case."
It is very difficult to live in a wooden house of the 18th century, - says Tatiana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment number 3.
The object is on state protection, but the money for its maintenance is not allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits, which the authorities simply forgot.
The last renovation was 40 years ago.
The walls are still poorly kept, but the foundation is rotten.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be satisfied in such conditions?!
The road passes directly under the windows, even the pedestrian zone is not.
Tatiana pulls back the curtain.
Now you can see what was only heard before: under the windows rushes a stream of cars.
You see, the glass rattles constantly, the windows can not open, and the noise used.
Man gets used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are golden.
Moreover, we have two rooms, we live three with our son.
And other families conditions are much worse, on the second floor in general ceilings just over one and a half meters high.
For contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from apartment no. 6 Lyudmila Starostina.
A pleasant hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile tells:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live: my husband and daughter and my granddaughter.
I've been here since birth, there has never been another living space, - Lyudmila circles the room with her eyes: mezzanine, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them is a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very closely and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historic."
But the ceiling regularly flows: the water system is no good.
Lyudmila speaks about her apartment casually and surprisingly at the same time, as an Italian woman whose house stands on Roman ruins.
That is, it reduces to one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water pipe was carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
At the same time they made us a small kitchen in a back and a toilet from a former closet.
We live exactly where Demidov and his family lived, and the servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
The Ufa Real Estate Center says privatization doesn't matter.
We still get only a one-room apartment, we can not claim more.
Four months ago they promised to resettle us, but it did not go beyond promises.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandparents, mother and dad, me and my husband and my daughter with a granddaughter.
Everything happened during that time.
For example, hefty rats ran around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the outhouse, they are meter thick!
They say the solution was mixed in the eggs, which is why it lasts so long.
The house is built thoroughly, thank you Demidov!
Probably that's why no one has been killed by the collapsed ceiling or piles.
Only the building still slowly dies before our eyes: the boards and logs of the house rot, the floors repeatedly failed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground, as in a well.
They say it is - under our room a secret loop and a passage to the White River, which was specially made by the Old Believers who once lived here, so that you can hide from the danger, in case of what.
They were persecuted.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how a historian came to them and begged them to start excavations in the apartment.
And then he urged them to give them a place to live in exchange for his one-piece on October Avenue.
Lyudmila refused to the historian:
Where are the four of us in one?
And here at least a tiny hope is that they will give housing more spacious.
If we had agreed to the exchange, we would not have won anything.
However, the Starostyn family did not win anything.
Lyudmila's biggest dream is to be resettled, and her daughter and her 16-year-old granddaughter were given a separate room.
That is, two families allocated a two-room apartment instead of not the most majestic ruins, in which two generations live now.
Cute, petite girl Olesya Karsakova from apartments 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There are two cramped rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, lives her large family.
There are seven of us, two children.
You can see the conditions.
Plaster falls off in pieces, as well as window frames, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms through holes.
The water in the tap all year round is only cold.
Walking through the apartments of Ufa's oldest house, you can see that the most fortunate couple Lavrentiev from apartment number 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.
You're right, there's a lot of room!
The room is 75 squares, three people are registered.
We live in the rooms where Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Lavrentyev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing - everything around bursts at the seams, falls apart, collapses.
Neighbors must have already told me!
Most of the torment we have with the floors: wooden boards rotted, the ground literally went away from under the feet.
I put the props, the wedges; there's nothing else in the room, and in the other room we walk like we're swinging on a swing, so it's so shaky.
Alexander Dmitrievich can tell about the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov better than any guide.
He treats the gold producer as his native, speaks about him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was extraordinary: the owner of the Kaginsky and Uzyansky factories built houses, cast guns and bells, kept Ural mines.
The heirs of the merchant real estate ancestor are proud, but they do not want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child in the 40s of the 20th century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden rooms for carriages, stables and guardhouses, which were later demolished.
In 1968 they wanted to clean our house, but something prevented...
History repeated itself in 2014: again beckoned new housing.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, ran the right authorities, and suddenly found out that the move to apartments is postponed to 2015 or 2016.
We don't believe in all this anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
Officials did not accept the tenant.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, they gave a piece of paper without a signature and a seal: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of tenants."
I even have a feeling that our house is long gone in terms of the city, because at first it was number 57, then became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like it was already demolished in the '70s.
"Russian Planet" turned to Vladimir Barabash, head of the information and analytical work of Ufa's land resources department.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of resettlement of dilapidated housing.
I can not answer for the actions of officials of the 70s, only know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value - is successfully implemented.
The tenants are to be resettled in new apartments soon.
According to Barabash, the restoration of the House of Demidov will be Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Now in Italy there is an architectural biennale, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire former Old Kazan Street will be restored, - the official says.
The houses will get the proper look, corresponding to what was before, three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to become a museum open to all comers.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street at the weekend pedestrian.
On weekdays, unfortunately, it will not work, too much congestion of roads in the city.
Vladimir Barabash promises to resettle people from the future museum in 2015.
However, it is unlikely that they will be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from another era.
In Primorye due to a thunderstorm started a forest fire
A dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire in the territory of the Hunting District forestry in the Pozhar district of the Primorsky region.
A group of forces and means is being built up at the site of the fire.
According to the management of the KSBU "Seaside Air Base" the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, deputy head of the airbase:
The fire, which occurred in a hard-to-reach area, was discovered by an observer pilot from aboard an An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
The tree remnants on the old burner are burning.
Strong cluttered territory and steepness of the slope more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable for landing paratroopers-fire areas create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
Delivery of forces available to the airbase by Mi-2 helicopter and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
Four parachutist firefighters were quickly dropped off at the scene after the fire was discovered.
The main task of specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional firefighting equipment.
Three paratroopers and firefighters were additionally delivered to the area of the village of Hunting by helicopter.
As soon as the landing site for the helicopter in the area of the fire will be ready, specialists will be transferred to the place of extinguishing, according to the website of the administration of the Primorsky region.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
Never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses a comedy, "Rudy's Rare Records," which is based in part on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the melodies are cheerful.
However, Henry had to wade through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death there was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often reflects on the relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: "Stop making noise.
Get away from your sister.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of hitting cricket.
I've never spoken to him like that.
He was such an unsmiling guy in the corner who read the paper for most of my life.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions were better than in his father's day, he was able to look at what his life must have been like.
Now it is a little better, but it is dark, smoky, depths of labyrinths of underworld with flashes of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.
My dad would go into the bathtub and just lay there, and you could hear him slowly start singing to himself because he wanted to get rid of the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing it for years and years to earn us a living, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry came out of his childhood devoid of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
It was only when Mom got sick at the very end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Daddy, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, whom he's been married to for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was the one who killed her.
So when I got very, very well and I developed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take drastic measures.
Then I started serious fitens, and I also had to go on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry's career trajectory is perhaps reflected in his noble, short-haired beard.
Ever since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has completely immersed himself in the theater.
"Comedy of Errors" followed august Wilson's "Fences."
This work differs from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his rich professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ noticed how he was parodying on stage, and wrote about him in "New Faces."
His career in television began in the mid-seventies: "For quite a while I was the only black parody/comedian on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working in television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in "The New Faces" in 1975
Since his manager had the rights to "Black and White Menstrels Show," an easy entertainment program in which people "ink their face," Henry discovered that he had been performing in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I kind of want it to never happen to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, reprehensible position, I worked on large venues and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "an award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
Representing characters who mocked the culture of blacks in the UK and chanted it, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the eighties.
The first season of "The Lenny Henry Show" aired in 1984, and in the nineties it was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock from the comedy series "Chef!".
Commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 SERIES on LennyHenry.tv the BBC," he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it's a little bit like you're pulling time or slowly turning away."
Then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 titled "What's good in...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I can't say I was really taught that at school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the preserve of middle-class white people with tights and cabbage at the bottom of the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You've got to try.
Don't scold it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of those words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's last monologue for the documentary, and he got hooked.
I got the feeling I could do this.
It's like my head's been straightened out.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it on.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be waiting for the disaster, but it didn't happen.
Soon we started "Comedy of Errors."
Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed.""
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.
"A quiet voice inside me said, "You're going to have to work 10 minutes while they're fixing the computer.""
Instead, the assistant director announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else deal with this.
"You play in a play, stay in the role.""
Henry in "Fences" at the Dachass Theatre
It was difficult to learn the text for "Fences."
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
She was well received, too, so it was like a sign from above, saying, "This is what you have to do.""
He says it, of course, in a GROM's voice.
So I'm holding on to that.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the mindset of a comedian - all the way our conversation is interrupted by flashes of his humor, when he then begins, then ends up parodying.
I just decided not to work in the standup, because this thing of getting instant rewards from a full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you're always trying to do that, it could come to a standstill.
I sometimes work at Apollo Direct when I want, but mostly I don't get as much pleasure as I used to.
I ask if he'll give a standup tour ever again.
The joy of sitting indoors with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the journey - I don't think I'll ever want to give it up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You're always telling a story, and it's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public servants to identify 'invisible workers'
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove "invisible workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, according to a government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has vowed to reduce government corruption since he came to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) a month was lost due to payments to "invisible workers" and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects that salaries continue to flow into bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports BBC reporter Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants must report to identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure their data is collected through a biometric registration procedure, according to a government statement.
Anyone who fails to do so without a good reason will be struck off the payroll, it said.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear payroll at both levels of government - hence put an end to the problem of "invisible workers,"" said Ann Vaiguru, cabinet secretary for planning and structuring power.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with 'conspiracy' against government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," local news agencies reported.
Police did not immediately comment.
Among those detained were 14 high-ranking officers, according to the Harriet Daily News.
Some of them participated last December in a corruption detection exercise aimed at vetting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) has identified their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting reporters that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony was held at not every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian People's Front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksean Pastukhov, the headmaster of the school in Slavyansk where Yatsenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their later lives.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the fact that children wear embroidered shirts, hold balloons and give flowers to their teachers.
In the person of Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found such an impressive leader that it needs
Behind it is a trail of fame from the world of banking, media management and inner circles of the Tory party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at global management consulting firm Bain and Co, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world at Pearsons.
She was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a senior position at Pearson's parent company was held by a male colleague in a lower position.
It is said that her earnings are approaching 1 million.
Her political rating is also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector professionals to Whitehall: she became a Cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman's job a poisoned chalice.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organisation at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The council has two orientations: inside as the top level of the bbc's management hierarchy itself, but also outward as a voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly that needs complete radical reform.
However, what new chairman would risk coming by trampling and destroying an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty if he loses his job in the process.
It's a difficult decision.
It wouldn't be that hard, many people would be happy to see how the BBC will shrink in size - after reviewing its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies defy cosy old habits, the inevitable negotiations over the cost of a licence pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of 145.50 per year, the British acquire a stake in, definitely, the greatest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its results cover 96 per cent of households and cost each of them just 40p a day.
Moreover, it is clear that the popularity of the Beeb is growing: 53 percent support it today, up from 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC's viewing and usage patterns have changed: now I'm getting news headlines on my mobile phone and watching missed programmes on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope he found him.
Perry, from Texas, says the humiliating tweet was tweeted by someone else
A tweet from the confirmed account of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry on Sunday night contained an offensive image of a Democratic district attorney at the center of a criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account, in which the post was disavowed.
Just from my account was posted a tweet that was written by someone else.
"I disapprove of this tweet and I removed it," the later post said.
Perry's aides did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
Although the recordings were uploaded from Perry's verified account, it was unclear who was actually posting the tape.
An earlier tweet contained an unflattering caricature of Travis County Prosecutor Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of driving while intoxicated in April 2013.
Perry imposed a funding ban on her department when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The tweet's caption reads: "I don't always drive while intoxicated, three times the legal blood alcohol level,.. but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me about it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg's office did not conduct a grand jury investigation against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry has pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His powerful legal team asked the judge leading the case to reject the indictment, saying the law used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history was vague, which was unconstitutional.
Perry stopped funding $7.5 million from the state's Public Audit Division, which is based in Travis County and was pursuing corruption in Texas's public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto prompted a formal complaint from a left-wing public watchdog group.
Perry's verified account tape is frequently updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming fifth at the party's convention in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he might be out of the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to "normal state"
One of London's most prominent property developers has warned that the property market in south-east England has "returned" to normal levels of activity.
Homes in the capital have been the subject of soaring demand and soaring prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble will push the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgeley, founder and chairman of luxury construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its peak in 2013," adding that this has provided a "stable working environment."
London's property market has excelled during the downturn as foreign buyers have moved to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped by 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to the Land Registry, well ahead of the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for Berkeley's private, affordable and student schemes rose by about a fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London property less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also been stopped by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "mansion tax" ahead of next May's general election.
London-based real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that April's reform of the mortgage market, which imposed tighter loan conditions, would also lead to a slowdown in both real estate and price transactions in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting a further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has cut its forecast for London property prices for 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis that property price sentiment has already begun to weaken.
Transactions volumes, meanwhile, fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital was very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales volumes to the amount of more than 2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgeley added: "Demand for the right product with a good design and better location has remained the same and, reflecting this, sales have remained for the duration."
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes this year through the end of April - almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit increased by 40 percent compared to the previous year to 380 million, revenue - by 18 percent to 1.6 billion.
Speaking ahead of the company's annual meeting on Monday, Mr Pidgeley said Berkeley's expected earnings for this year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, the profit for the full year is expected to be in the first year of the pre-tax profit of 450 million.
Berkeley's share price was held at 23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence published online by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Annual Academy Awards.
Photos of nude actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Academy Award, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a "catalogue" of photos of 100 other rising stars.
A spokesman for the "Hunger Games" star confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real and condemned the hacker for "brazen intrusion into personal space."
There has been an appeal to law enforcement, and they will prosecute anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly obtained due to a flawed Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalogue" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's unclear how many of these photos are genuine, though "Scott Pilgrim vs. All" star Winstead on Twitter also condemned the hacking.
"To those who look at the photos we took with my husband a few years ago when we were secluded at home - I hope you are proud of yourself," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victoria's Winner" denied that she had the photos, writing on Twitter: "These so-called nude photos of me ARETISH, people.
Let me stop this in the bud. It's intentional.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that a spokeswoman for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos, which she believed to be, were genuine.
An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J" that drew praise from critics
They dissolved, it is best to say so, they gradually fell apart like a cardboard box, which was left in the rain.
Only sometimes did the woman tell him that he was too serious, heavy in communication, tense, closed and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw himself as irritable.
He was prickly, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this prickly was a small novel, from which he waited more than usual, getting rid of a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileenn Solomons was a tremulously fragile beauty with swollen hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Roiben.
She came south with a companion older than herself, whom Kevern considered her aunt, and the latter inherited a house in a damp but paradise-like valley under the joyous name "Paradise Valley."
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes flowed, the spiders sat motionless in the baths, the slugs left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; garden overgrown with weeds, similar to giant cabbage heads.
It was like a cottage made of a children's book, both intimidating and charming, with a secret garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in the longlist of the Booker Prize in 2014.
Shortlist to be announced next week
Kevern and Eileenn sat holding hands, in broken loungers among the high grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; they both absent-mindedly joined a cheap console that provided the country with soothing music and soothing news when, looking at her crossed brown legs, he remembered an old song by a long-forgotten black performer, whom his father liked to listen to by lowering the curtains in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type on the console no longer played.
They were not banned - nothing was actually forbidden - just they were not lost.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic."
Public taste did what would never be achieved by orders and regulations, and just as among the books people chose memoirs of the rich, who grew up in poverty, cookbooks and love novels, from all the music they chose ballads.
Fascinated by this day, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and a crude comic voice to glorify the big legs of Eileenn.
Eileenn didn't get it.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he told her, mechanically putting two fingers to her lips.
So always did his father to stop the letter "J" before it flew off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father as he told him.
Start with "J" by forgetting to put two fingers on your mouth, and it's going to cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game back then and it wasn't much fun now.
He knew he was expected to do that, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Eileenn never heard him.
The Jazz didn't play either, though it wasn't openly banned.
Improvisation has gone out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
With wit in the same way.
His unpredictability got on people's nerves.
And jazz was a wit expressed by music.
Although he had reached the age of 10 without ever hearing about Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileenn that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, and this meant that each of its segments agreed with gratitude - thanks to those who were saved by fate - with the principle of group predisposition.
Afro-Caribbean people were well suited to entertainment and sports in their temperament and physical characteristics - and they sang and ran.
Natives of the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature talented in everything related to electronics, made sure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was plumbing; what was left of the Greek was beating the plates.
The people of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not leave the country rapidly, when THAT, IF THE WORLD was happening, in fear that they would be accused of igniting the flames, in fear, in fact, that the flames would engulf them next, opened restaurants with labnea and hookahs, did not stick out and yearned for idleness.
Everyone's ability.
Since she had only heard ballads before, Eileenn found it hard to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sung to her could have been put to music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Unless maybe for people who have big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of safety.
No word could penetrate through the soundproofing of giant leaves, similar to cabbage.
Eileenn didn't understand anyway.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to press two fingers to his lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"It seemed ridiculous to him, " he said instead.
She shook her head incredulously, closing Kevern's review.
In the whole world there was nothing but a cop of her blue-black hair.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if that's what you say, " she said, remaining in her opinion.
But that still doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do my legs get too big?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Ankles, maybe a little bit...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you precisely because you have thick ankles," he tried instead.
I'm so disgusted.
It didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often led him into awkward situations, because, like his father, he lacked that soothing charm, which could mitigate the cruelty that was dug up in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to, Kevern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Eileenn Solomons blushed and got up from the sun lounger, knocking over the console and spilling the wine they were drinking.
Wine from elderflower, so intoxication could not justify him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you because you have a stupid head," she said.
You don't like it, though.
He felt sorry for her, both because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebuffed him.
Did she think he was going to hit her?
She did not talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that in the main features she looked like a local.
The same huge icy ocean hit them both.
The same bewildered men, even more sensitive and capricious after WHAT, IF REALLY, than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered furiously from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand to any woman who dared to refuse them or tease them.
Dumb head?
They'd have shown her a blunt fist if she hadn't been careful!
First, if they had kissed, the kiss would now become the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; antidote to the fresh ballads that the console gave out - first kiss her, and then hit.
Excessive clarification, according to Kevern, because the kiss itself was already hooliganism.
Eileenn Solomons corps showed that he had to leave.
He rose from the sun lounger like an old man.
She herself felt the leaden weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window watched him leave, her companion - a man who himself took on the burdens.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a shot of compassion for him and the men in general, even though some of them raised their hand on her.
The man who turned away from her, with his bent back, shamed, smitten, all the ability to fight left him - why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember a single occasion until today when she would have seen such a thing?
Again, one Eileenn Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above or so, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked for Ofnau, the unofficial Public Mood Monitoring Service, produced a small report on the persistence of low to medium levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decline if it did not stop altogether, given the means and strength that stood out for its eradication.
"Much has been done, and much is being done," she wrote, "to soften the innate aggressiveness of the people who fought in thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow russells where, despite the spires hovering over the hedges, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in history.
However, some qualities, it turns out, are ineradicable.
The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions that it gives rise to.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories about the obstacles overcome and declares its fervent belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only old rudeness retains its strong grip in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there is also evidence that a new and vicious bullying is emerging in homes and workplaces. on the roads and even on playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate habit of writing too much," said its scientific director, after reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "not because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We have no preconceptions here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as those you have shown me.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call "evil" and "rude" others would interpret as an expression of natural vitality and energy.
To continue to be mean about WHAT WHAT, IF REALLY, as if it happened, if at all, yesterday, is to deprive the country of the vitality it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head pink as a flamingo, LED letters echoed the advice that "Ofnau" had given the country the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile for your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Conversation is better than silence, the word song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I totally understand what you're saying," Esme Nussbaum said quietly, when made sure her scientific director had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything other than that we haven't healed as effectively as we convince ourselves.
My concern is that if we are not ready, we will find that we are repeating the mistakes that originally led to WHAT WHAT, IF THE WORLD.
Only this time we will throw away our anger and distrust not on others.
Luther Rabinowitz connected his fingertips into a pyramid.
This gesture was supposed to mean infinite patience.
"You go too far," he said, "calling "mistakes" actions that our grandfathers did or didn't commit.
You go too far when you say that they have thrown away their "anger" and "distrust" on "others."
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that, understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we do not talk about "us" and "them."
There were no "us" and there were no "others."
It was a time of disarray - that's all we know.
"For which, to be honest with myself," dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can well justify itself.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what is done, it is done.
Then it was then.
There's no need to say anything else - we agree here.
And how not to blame anyone, do not make excuses if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not to learn -
The past is a thing of the past for us to forget it.
If I can add one word to that -
Luther Rabinowitz's pyramid fell apart.
"I'll review your report, " he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove onto the pavement, as described by passers-by, "in spiteful rage".
Coincidences happen.
The Lesotho army says the coup was not planned; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Lesotho's army denied that it was preparing a coup to overthrow the Government, saying that they had acted against the police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, saying the country's army had encircled his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, claiming that he had received a threat of an attempt on his life.
Army spokesman Maj. Thllehle Ntoy said there had been no coup but that the army was responding to a threat from "political fanatics" whom the police were trying to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces took action by receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police that are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to cause chaos," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyella said the army's actions looked like a coup.
"While no one has claimed power grabs by force, according to all accounts, the actions of the Lesotho armed forces so far have major signs of a coup," he said.
Lesotho army officials said the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing runs the government in Tabane's absence.
Tabane said he believed he was under attack for trying to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Taban suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his unified Government.
He stated that his actions had not undermined the Government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on loan at AC Milan, reports the Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
Last season he took to the pitch as a member of the London club only three times.
Earlier, AC Milan rented striker Fernando Torres from Liverpool.
Eurozone production at lowest level in 13 months
Eurozone output growth slowed to its lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The eurozone manufacturing sector's latest index of business activity (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed and businesses have been hit by growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The values came before a meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will expect the bank to have a clear plan for how to cope with the eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi later this week may be giving further signals that he is mulling a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"While some growth is better than no growth at all, the brake effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more apparent," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The PMI of germany's manufacturing sector, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economy, France' PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does Italy's weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
Signs that growth momentum has faded in mainly industrial growth, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also adds to confidence," Mr Dobson said.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to add more fuel to the fire for analysts waiting for the introduction of additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said about the August survey of the eurozone manufacturing sector business index is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "Eurozone producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - particularly those associated with Russia/Ukraine - add uncertainty to still challenging conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit business - and especially consumer confidence - and is likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it was "increasingly similar" that the ECB would, of course, have to carry out some sort of quantitative easing, "although we suspect it will be limited."
Residents of Mariupol will put up a human chain against the militias
In Mariupol until last week everything was calm - no one was eager to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are waiting with horror for the arrival of the "militias".
According to political analysts, the separatists break through to Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - recently the city of Novoazovsk, which was not a member of the self-proclaimed republics, was recently taken.
Mariupol decided that the Ukrainian army, although it will protect them, but its forces are few against the well-armed representatives of the DNR-LNR, and gathered to help the military.
They dig trenches, build roadblocks and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a live chain, singing the national anthem of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and transport equipment and food, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
Shops are gradually closing in the city, banks and ATMs are shutting down.
Ten years of hell for Beslan survivors: Ten years on from the eerie takeover of the school as the children who ended up in it still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during the school atrocity
Exactly ten years after the horrific seizure of a Beslan school, in which 334 people died, including 186 children, heroically survived the disaster warned last night about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed like something of an extreme evil.
Tragedy united east and west in disgust, which miraculously then escalated into action and hope for the future in the face of severe grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death during a school atrocity.
We found amazing young people who confronted trouble, although memories of terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now tormenting Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now stop.
Girl pictured trying to climb back into shelled gym
It is captured on the picture of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when in one underwear tried to climb back into the shelled gym after the explosion of a mine.
At a loss, Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that they were both dead, but in fact they survived.
"The woman told me to run with all my might, but I couldn't, " said Aida at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday said: 'Three months ago the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgery.
A few shrapnel left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people just as doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but she certainly didn't break it," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzera Gapoeva, was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the capture stays with her, though the memories dim a little each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our woes and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from the UK and from everywhere.
When I see a picture on the Internet where I climb through the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make sure that it does not happen again.
The boy who ran through a hail of bullets, believing his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians start school at 7 years old) and survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
He was seven at the time, and he said, "Mum told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She told him, "Run."
Fearing she was dead, he ran and on the road saw a crying toddler, grabbed the child's hand and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her.""
In fact, Tamara got out and was in the hospital with injuries to her legs, in turn thinking that her son was dead.
After their reunion, she said: "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (now a defunct newspaper News of the World), where he was awarded as a Children's Advocate by the Barnardo's Foundation, Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can say that in my memory it fades.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard who never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy shop where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted and a ride in an open-top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the kind of grief that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him.
"I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who last week volunteered at a convent.
I'm so much here to help.
I want to serve in the police someday and hope that I will be enrolled in the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the eerie silence right after the capture, there just weren't children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She vividly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London cried as I told our story.
I realized then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Sheri and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting them with his water pistol, and they were running away and playing with him.
And only a month passed after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: "I keep thinking this world hasn't gotten any better in these 10 years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is a news report that they listen to when they're bored or when they're doing something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive and not evil.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not fixated on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other war toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, cute, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got to my feet, I looked around, I saw the hell around me, when body parts were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember shouting to him, "Damir, run, run," but then again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
So life for us continues, unlike so many others.
Georgi Ilyin, 17 years old
Boy whose shocking post-capture photo has become crucial to Beslan tragedy
Rest of heart: Beslan survivor Georgi Ilyin with his mother Fatima after his capture in 2004, and right George today
His bloodied face had a mark of fear as he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a chief medical officer, took him to school on the first day of school before taking his eldest son, Vladimir, to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare," she recalled.
Not quite alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes these days are all the time in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Heartbreaking: George's photograph (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalised in a sculpture (right)
I remember that George wanted to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of a crying George in San Marino.
George doesn't like looking at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but I also feel that this photo makes people feel our pain.
George says now: "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they are investigating this crash of Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, no one wants war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need decades to go by to forget her a little bit.
It's affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years I had nightmares because of the seizure, but now it's better.
I went back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym before every September 1.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to walk into a gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and enrolled in a medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to study to become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but my health didn't allow me to.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it's not going to happen.
Georgi Farniev, 20
Boy who survived despite being at the feet of a killer terrorist
Incredible: Georgi Farniyev was at the feet of a terrorist killer at the time of the capture, but still managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a terrorist killer.
Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.
"It seems to us that it was still yesterday," says George, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB but was unable to because of the damage that was done to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children easily cope with bad events - I have to say that it is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
2005 - the following year - was the first and last time I walked into this gym again.
I passed out.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show where I was sitting in this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgi Farniyev today with an open laptop photo of himself in hospital after the seizure
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking normally.
But still health did not allow me to go to study at the FSB academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second hobby was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not something children should know, and certainly not something they have to go through.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse, as the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate her.
I know George won't go.
For him, it has to be even stronger because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan, the imprint rests on everyone.
He stays with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had a few surgeries, he can walk, but he can't play sports.
I would say that he has overcome this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture and this only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me and this is the best gift God could make me, but my heart aches for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget my heart jumping out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world - wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We've been one tight-knit country in the past, how come we're at a time?
People and children are suffering, I am sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could grab all the rebels and throw it away, as far away as you can.
Aliona Tskaeva, 10 years old
Baby, who was touchingly carried to safety by a special forces soldier
Rescued: Aliona Tskaeva is carried to safety by a Russian special forces soldier (left).
She is now ten (right) and has no memory of the heinous crime.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when little Aliona was carried out in his arms from a captured school in Beslan by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christina and brother Mahar in the school gym.
Machar, who was three at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the deadly carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and he and his new wife Svetlana have a young daughter, whom he named Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Aliona, who is now ten, has no recollection of the capture and blossomed into a smart and cheerful girl, neighbors say.
"They're a big happy family now, and Aliona and Machar are both lovely kids," says a close friend.
Ruslan - a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can see why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Borussia Dortmund, said he was looking forward to being able to take to the pitch again in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyous event in his career.
Of course, I am very happy that I will play for Borussia Dortmund again," Kagawa quoted Bild as saying.
I feel very good.
Full of positive emotions and looking forward to being able to take to the pitch again in the form of Borussia Dortmund.
Kagawa joined United from Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to gain a foothold in the English club, having played only 38 league games in two seasons, scoring six goals and giving up eight assists.
Man charged with hitting girl at 'pelican' pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man will stand trial charged with assaulting a three-year-old girl at a pelican pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit the girl at a crossing in Pittenwyn, East New York.
Prosecutors said Mr. Stewart drove his Audi 3 without due care and attention and hit the girl, causing her injury.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, pleaded guilty at Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the royal counsel, set a trial date for Jan.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande won't buy in Vladivostok
Duty Free duty-free shop at Vladivostok Airport has put up a sign prohibiting shopping in this store by a number of world political leaders.
Do not buy them perfume, vodka and cognac.
The administration of the store decided that U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Vitali Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, the Prime Minister of Japan and several other famous comrades will not be able to buy vodka, cognac and perfume in their store.
And I hung a sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama received a ban on appearance in an even less accessible service to him - Dietary canteens MSU, as reported by the website of catering establishments.
It is not known whether the American president ever dreamed of eating in a diet canteen in Russia, but the authors of the bans clearly seem to themselves terribly witty.
Is there any cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the embargo, Russian farmers should adopt new technologies in order to establish the production of cheeses demanded by buyers.
The advice was given during a visit to the Company "Yugpticeprom" of the company "Agrocomplex".
The head of the government also advised restaurateurs to refocus on Russian meat, the quality of which is at the proper level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been imposed in Russia since August 7.
The head coach of the Russian national team Valentin Maslakov is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third place is a good result given the lack of purposeful preparation for the competition.
Our athletes performed at their level, - quotes "All Sport" Maslakov's words.
Third place is a confirmation of our fairly high team level.
It is nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans above us is minimal.
We have to take into account that we did not prepare for these competitions.
The season is over and we did not oblige our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we have been second in this tournament, but this season we have a refreshed national team.
The French, on the contrary, put forward a combat-ready team, including 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which was repeatedly publicly announced.
But even such a line-up of the hosts of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians performed in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were much lower than in the same Diamond League.
The season is over.
Naturally, the result is not so important for the athletes, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, it came to the absurd, when at 1500 m men were so fond of tactical intricacies of running, that showed the result below the average level ... women's races.
4 tips on how to get the best quality underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or shoot videos underwater, you have a number of hardware options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof soapbox, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3' Silver Edition, both of which sell for about $300.
I took these pictures on a family holiday with several cameras, all priced at about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed in order to get the best results.
Recheck your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you're going to shoot.
Some photo and video cameras have modes of shooting or object type that optimize exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, understand how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are only 5 feet high, others are 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our buyer's guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Shoot a few frames - because many of them will not work.
Soaps have a lcd that will help you to put together pictures, whereas action cameras usually do not.
Even if you have a yuCD, it will be difficult to see underwater, and the layout of the frame will be a random process.
So do a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial shooting mode that shoots multiple frames with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay near the surface.
The amount of light is significantly reduced the deeper you dive under the water.
If possible, stay near the surface when you shoot in the pool, river or ocean.
It will also allow you to convey more color in the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you'll see.
Swim closer to the shooting sites.
This is great advice for shooting on land, but it is even more important underwater because of the darkened light conditions.
It's especially important if you're shooting on an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you'll have to get close to the subjects if you want to fill the frame.
Bronze medalist of the Olympic Games in 2012 in freestyle wrestling Bilal Makhov can go to the Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was announced by the head coach of the Dagestan national freestyle wrestling team Sajid Sazhidov.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of the athlete at the World Championships in Tashkent in September 2014.
At present, Bilal Makhov is at the training camp of the "classics" team, - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Sajd sajidov.
In general, Bilal performed in both styles in juniors.
At the 2005 World Youth Championships, he won the freestyle tournament and the third prize-winner in greco-Roman competitions and decided to concentrate on freestyle wrestling.
There has long been talk that our heavyweight will spend a new stage of his career in Greco-Roman wrestling.
I will say more: Makhov can perform at the World Championships in Tashkent - if he wins the outfit.
But the final word is always behind the coaching staff headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of person whose strength of personality could shake things up, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
A consulting anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to ridding patients of both the suffering of the disease and the torment of treatment.
Among those who spoke to him, his wife recalls, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors were passionate about diagnoses and illnesses, those undergoing treatment were mostly concerned about something completely different - pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found that he was irritatingly reproaching his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster, not later," he said.
When Juliet left for a week, Lawson discovered that he was unusual and incomprehensible why upset.
Something wasn't right.
He asked a colleague to have a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The X-ray results came in.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or the lining of the lungs.
For most crayfish, it is difficult to find out the exact cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But with mesothelioma in a different way.
In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called a "miracle" but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be overlooked.
Asbestos, after all, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommendational industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipe-engineers, builders, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.
But such calmness is wrong.
The UK, it turns out, is now at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic.
Here, more people die from mesothelioma than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual mortality rate of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than from car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and projected future deaths in the UK
The reason we feel its deadly effects now is that although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), the development of mesothelioma usually takes decades.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction specialties.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases remains, laid in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of wealth, profession or age.
The bastions of electability, from trendy London department stores to private schools, were not a salvation.
The Houses of Parliament are riddled with asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are designed to treat us have turned out to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pipe-proofer.
As a matter of fact, he had to think about where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It seems that there could be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years on probation," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and movers - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who trained at Guy's Hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma over the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I am the only survivor."
How many of us are going to get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
He was 55 when he died on February 17 this year.
It's unusual to live so long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
It's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in the UK, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely to suggest that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK should die, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people now have no idea they're going to die like this.

A quick review of reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma attack has spread.
This June, for example, Marks and Spencer admitted that Janice Ellen had been exposed to asbestos by neglect.
She worked at the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, running the clothing department at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at the M'S.
She now has two children over the age of 20.
"Before it happened," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I never thought I'd be affected.
Few people really know much about asbestos.
As a matter of fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They get their name from the word "asbestosforms," which means a fibrous structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roofing panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation pipes, boiler seams, even in brake pads of cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of health damage" that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amositis) and blue asbestos (crocidolit).
The UK was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there are good, albeit indirect, reasons to believe that this is the main cause of the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma (in the UK)."

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients which suggests that "a significant percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."
Much of this impact, he says, is due to "routine use and weather exposure" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which looked at the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even at the heart of government, may have been exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and pipelines behind the parliamentary committee premises were contaminated with asbestos, which could have been driven by something as innocuous as "strong air flows."
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.
Although the Parliamentary Maintenance Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had received a "clean sanitary certificate", it has now admitted that work is needed to refurbish the Parliament by improving the electric and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, MPs may be sitting in the conference centre of the E2 nearby rather than on the green benches of Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that "the asbestos situation was not managed in accordance with different rules."
It is impossible to know whether this management error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who has not been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a GP.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital that was successfully sued for asbestos," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places where I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009, when he was struck by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45 and was in the middle of surgery late at night.
Suddenly I started to get feverish.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the pleura, the shell around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
Ultimately, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Puzzled doctors took chest X-rays and put pleural catheters to pull fluid out of the lungs and send it for tests.
Yet his condition went undiagnosed.
Gradually, his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he exercised and breathed heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to his waiting room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and the doctor who consulted him showed his CT results and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel unwell, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the shell of his chest and the shell of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just move on," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott immersed himself in meetings with Macmillan's nurses, one of whom suggested he contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings where asbestos thermal insulation on pipes was quite common," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people of atypical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-isolated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that patients will be affected.
But many staff members who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly actually exposed to the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were a place where, theoretically, saved lives for pocients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
He's still being removed today.
Schoolchildren installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos stands
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its amazing insulation and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools, too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos for the first time in the classroom.
Across the country, in countless chemistry classes, schoolchildren installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos coasters.
Websites have emerged to highlight the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, innocuous things such as floor tiles or roof sheds tended to contain asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison embedded in a huge amount of our buildings," said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful when demolishing garden sheds.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is huge.
"It takes quite a while to realise that," Graham Abbott said.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but realized that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to go away and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not going to celebrate Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of the doctor to the patient's position.
As countless patients before him, he remembers being baffled by the amount of information that had to be taken.
"It was hard to grasp everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to celebrate Christmas anymore.
That's it.""
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous because it is the mechanics of how we support life - the very act of breathing - that causes cancer, which kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises from inhaling needle fibers of asbestos," Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
It is the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, a leading mesothelioma treatment centre.
Treger knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably exposed while in hospital.
When asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, Says Treger, "breathing them pushes to the periphery where the shell is.
This is, at its core, an invasive process from the beginning.
Conventional treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Treger disagrees.
"You can't cut the pleura," he says.
It is impossible to approach around her with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer "does not lend very well to chemotherapy" which "acts" but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are patients who live long," says Treger.
But at the end of the day, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen J Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two-and-a-half years after his diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he fell ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, single-handedly became a support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he said cheerfully when they called.
"He was very positive," Abbott said.
He was diagnosed four years ago and is still very energetic.
At first, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life by just a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "managed to give the whole a slightly more positive coloring."
After meeting several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lange-Lazdunski, professor of thoracic surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"We had the advantage of not having directions, I just called them and they accepted me," Graham admits.
The average patient would have to receive referral and approval for funding.
Money is crucial for patients with mesothelioma to get the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment is finally ineffective, many patients face another financial cause for concern - the future of the families they will leave behind.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos is harmful to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small amounts could put health at risk.
That's when the companies started talking about bad faith.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full-cost settlement," according to Morgan, as Lawson could not unequivocally prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
Following an investigation into his death, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed, however, that "asbestos in the basements in question was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
As a matter of fact, tying deadly exposure to asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after that - has proved a big problem for mesothelioma patients demanding compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed ownership or closed.
Insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend against lawsuits know that on their side of the time, which the plaintiffs, of course, do not have.
In response, major new legislation has been introduced this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma patients to recover compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
In accordance with this law, a £350-million fund funded by the insurance industry has been created for those who have been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact, but who has no one to sue.
In such cases, the patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a normal compensation case - about 120,000.
About 300 successful lawsuits under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that the £350 million represents a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers," he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if a time period hadn't intervened and mesothelioma patients could track down companies and file lawsuits the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, the former Work and Pensions Secretary, admitted the law was "flawed."
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that, while seven people die every day, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering so badly and they need help today," Penning said during the bill's second reading of mesothelioma last December.
By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lange-Lazdunski boasts as many as 40 per cent of surviving patients over five years.
Abbott felt a surge of energy.
"It's certainly one of the most important things," Abbott said.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is some power that supports you.
When you give up, the condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott went into surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no trace of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March.
There were a few spots in my chest.
I was about to turn 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
Again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there is no trace of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things - about finances when I die, for example, or about showing your wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you get bleak.
We need to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father, 16, and Tamzin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease, which means I wouldn't live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a call very quickly.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimpse of the possibility of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as, ultimately, for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos tissues.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen pots and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
Now a canvas has been invented that is not flammable.
I saw napkins made of him smouldering in the fireplaces at banquettes
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are opening in Canada and South Africa and soon after in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the perfect heat insulator for steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
Global asbestos production is growing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Statistics from Prudential identify premature deaths among those who work with asbestos and are therefore denied life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr William Cook testifies that asbestos particles in her lungs "were undoubtedly the leading cause of death."
This is the first case of this type.
Kershaw's employers, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not recognize liability.
No compensation is paid.
During the Second World War, shipbuilding, one of the most deadly professions in terms of contact with asbestos, was developing intensively.
Voluntary industrial ban on imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful health claim caused by asbestos contact in the UK.
Global asbestos production grows to more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
The UK imports 139,000 tonnes.
The UK's Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety requires all asbestos contractors to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act has been passed in the UK.
A compensation scheme of £350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
World production is held at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose its leaders; protesters vow to take revenge
China's parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to kick-start long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People's Congress essentially allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It hasn't deceived our expectations, but it still infuriates," said lawmaker Emily Lau, the Democratic party's chairwoman.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And it is obvious that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said allowing the popular nomination of Hong Kong's leader to be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the region's residents to vote for the head of government starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a nomination commission tightly controlled from Beijing.
And, according to a new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision came after a summer of one of the largest and most publicized protests in Hong Kong in years.
Behind much of Hong Kong's pro-democracy campaign is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to cut off Hong Kong's financial district unless Beijing guarantees real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement was moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise in the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently seeking to avoid problems with government agencies.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement "considered the possibility of capturing the central district only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
It is with great regret that we report that to date all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the capture of the central region will undoubtedly take place.
Government authorities in Hong Kong had been preparing for Beijing's announcement for several days, and security measures were stepped up at government headquarters on Sunday, involving police and barricades.
At the heart of the unrest is the feeling among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of residents from the mainland increases competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put Hong Kong's business, the lifeblood of, at risk.
"The protest they're talking about can cause a lot of economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long," said lawmaker Regina Yip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is spiraling out of control.
It's a view that's bad for investment.
Chinese state media have also reported in recent days that Hong Kong pro-democracy activists have been shown by saboteurs sent by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on suffrage that attracted 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
American graduation culture reaches university life: freshmen offered to arrive on private jet
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the UK's first luxury travel service for current students.
To leave a vivid impression of arriving at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also said the service had been thought about safety.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to drive their belongings across the country in a dangerously congested car.
Combined with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping this year's students get to university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that since the service had just been launched, orders had not yet been received, but added that "students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks."
The company also stated that despite the fact that students are faced with the need to pay tuition fees of £9,000 per year, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Today's students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and expectations: more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, NSS Vice President for Higher Education, said: "This project seems incredibly out of touch with most students.
Many students who start university this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to keep pace with soaring spending on basic needs, before they can even start thinking about taking out thousands of pounds for something like just arriving at a hostel.
Feminists raise issue of race and police behavior after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who came raise their hands, chanting "Hands up, don't shoot" as they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, related to the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam zoila Perez noticed a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who commented put gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions grew in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Perez saw responses from white women who focused 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9 killings, personal essays with headlines such as "thoughts about Ferguson on behalf of a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about oppressing women" appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic of the crisis we're facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so racially attached, they feel they have to point it out.
For Korita Mitchell Ferguson, an English professor at Ohio State University, he laid bare the challenges that black Americans face every day but which are not perceived as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's happening to me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," says Mitchell.
When I write something about people of color being attacked in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about public safety?" she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied issues of race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between issues related to race and gender.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly share those issues; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the rape of a white woman was almost always the basis," Hattery said.
It took a white woman to corroborate the story to substantiate the lynching.
From Hattery's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes such as Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for suffrage would only be effective for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all their eggs in the voting basket for women, and the right to vote for blacks was to appear later," Hattery said.
Looking back at these things gives us a clear idea of why women of color don't trust white women.
We didn't do any good.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynchings in the Women's Association of the South for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group came nearly 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell's point of view, the rise of white feminists' reactions to the issues raised by the situation in Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "catch up" with problems that black women have faced in generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists who have such a "traditional feminist" ideology were just as serious about the right to raise a child as they feel about the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Second-wave feminists who have made careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what it means.
A prominent white feminist activist, Gloria Steinem, took to Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown's murder and published a scathing article by The Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take part in racist protests.
"I hope that women who have another but similar reason to understand the dangers of the body - and the views on racial issues that differ significantly in the public polls - will be at the forefront of change," Steinem wrote.
While Steinem vouchs for more intersecting feminism, which includes both issues of race and gender, her comments about race in America still surprise some.
American Enterprise Institute researcher Christina Sommers, author of "Who Stole Feminism?", told The People that young men in the United States, especially young people of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson contradict the criticism she has previously criticized.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, "Watch My Brother," to help vulnerable black and Hispanic youths, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
Police relations with the black community are not the only issues that advance the front lines of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Patrol arrested about 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's southwestern border this year, immigration reform came to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present the issue as important to women, she only needed to share stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to male immigrants, women who come with them find themselves in positions vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate with women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich house 'with a pig' for sale
A photograph of the house for sale in Suffolk was removed by estate agents when it was found to show a large pig resting in the living room.
Put up for sale for £120,000, a detached one-bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description featured a photograph of the living room of the house - which depicted a pig with his head resting on a sofa.
Real estate agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo is the home pet of the homeowner.
"However, the photo was posted by mistake and has already been deleted," a company spokeswoman said.
In a detailed description of the home, Connells described the former meetinghouse as a "unique detached one-bedroom home."
Although the agency has removed the photo from its website, it is still stored in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, with some asking if the pig was being sold with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, who lost to Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round match of the US Open, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year with dignity and try to reach a new level, reports Vasily Osipov from New York.
How do you overall assess your results at this year's Grand Slam tournaments?
Of course, I'm glad I won at Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially in the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
After all, I couldn't even reach the quarterfinals.
What are your goals for the rest of the season?
After a disappointing defeat, I have a huge motivation to reach a new level.
I have a lot to work on, and I'm going to do everything I can to finish the year with dignity.
The Asian series of tournaments begins in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuev suggested that bonuses should be given bonuses when entering universities for fulfilling the rules of the TRP.
According to him, in general the standards will be the same as in Soviet times - people will pass the standards on pull-up, running and other exercises.
Recall that 12 subjects of Russia will start implementing the TRP rules on their territory on September 1.
I also offered schoolchildren who passed the TRP to give bonuses when entering universities, - said Valuev.
For example, you can add them a little points to the EEG.
There are also proposals to give an additional severance to employees of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
In the city of Harvey in South Wales there was a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in Perth's south-west, where one lucky man will take home almost $1.1 million from Saturday night's lottery draw.
The newspaper kiosk in Harvey brings gold in the main prize draw for the second time in five years, the last win was $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still needs to declare himself.
Shop owner Steve Forward said the win caused a stir in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole town is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought that such a win could be secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated winning the top prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for the state's players.
Last week, the Canning Vale player became one of five August millionaires, following the couple's huge $7.5-million win from Belmont just weeks earlier.
The winning couple have been playing for twenty years and said the win gave them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
Millionaire Harvey brings the number of top prize winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total winning of $85 million.
Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce a comprehensive plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, said Oleg Pluzhnikov, deputy director of the ministry's department, at a roundtable held by Vedomosti at the Moscow Motor Show in 2014.
The plan is made on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted in late September - early October, Pluzhnikov says, the proposed measures relate to electric cars and hybrids - the plan for the development of vehicles on gas-engine fuel in Russia is already there.
The plan (a copy of Vedomosti) is designed for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport need to be developed and how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
The report to the government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electric vehicles, will be prepared by December 2014; The scheme of concessional lending and preferential leasing will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of machines, stimulate localization and build service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is expected to make changes in regulations to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities during 2015 to encourage the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of providing it with advantages in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to expand public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce criteria on the list of indicators of evaluation of regional authorities, reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of clean transport and the development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric cars in Russia is still in its infancy - in 2013, about 100 electric cars were sold in the whole country.
In early 2014, the import duty on electric cars was zeroed, so sales will amount to about 500 pieces, predicts the chief executive officer of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia Andrey Pankov.
But the five-fold growth does not make electric cars any noticeable: in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, 2.78 million cars and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric cars to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says Nicolas Remiz, director of strategic planning and partnerships at Renault in Russia.
Most of the other manufacturers of electric transport took a wait-and-see attitude towards Russia.
The development of electric cars is also available to Russian manufacturers - ", GASA, ", but the output is minuscule.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to ASM-holding, Avtovaz produced 30 electric vehicles.
Demand is low because of the high cost of electric cars, admits the director of "AvtoVAz" engineering Sergey Amanov, without state support breakthrough in this segment will not ....
The development of the Russian electric car market in addition to the high cost of cars (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average twice as expensive as analogues with internal combustion engines) is constrained by the underdevelopment of charging infrastructure (refueling - units), sighs the CEO of "Autostat" Sergey Celikov.
Due to the high cost and low rate of cost reduction, electric cars will remain a niche segment of the Russian market in the next 3-4 years, predicts Mikhail Postnansky, editor-in-chief of Autorevu, and Celikov agrees with him.
Automakers, by contrast, say some models of electric cars are already close to the cost of conventional ones.
The Russian electric car market has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "electromobility" is real; This, in particular, will be facilitated by the emergence of new charging stations, stresses the president of BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state-owned company Rosseti: several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of a network of gas stations are underway with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sofyin, director of the Rossetei department, the company believes in the electric car market and is ready to build gas stations all over the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric cars of different brands.
In addition, Rossetti, as a network company, is not allowed to sell electricity, and the possibility of doing so with regard to charging electric vehicles is being worked out.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the electric car market in Russia by zeroing customs duties.
The zero rate will be in force until the end of 2014, the possibility of extending it and expanding the preferential list is being worked out.
Replacing the transport tax with an environmental one (the idea is discussed and applies to all cars) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where the tax cut has led to a sharp increase in sales of electric cars - now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, we need and stimulating measures for car owners, such as free parking in the city center (as already done in Moscow), Pankov believes, or the ability to move electric cars on dedicated lanes, which in Russia is not yet available.
Private jet crashes in Colorado
A single-engine Piper PA-46 plane crashed in the US state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it were killed, ITAR-TASS reports.
The survivors were taken to hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the runway of Denver Airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Donetsk region, they deal with the captives of the Donbass battalion.
Punishers surrounded near Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of security forces were killed under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation in southeastern Ukraine really is, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
Punishers from the battalion "Donbass" survived after the "meat grinder" in which they got near Ilovaisk.
Surrounded by the army of the Donetsk People's Republic, the militants spent several days, effectively abandoned by their commanders and the Ukrainian authorities.
When it was reported from the headquarters that it was possible to leave the "ring" along the supposedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But just a couple of minutes later, shells and bullets whistled from all sides.
"Judging by the information I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave," says the acting deputy battalion commander, who has the call sign "Lermontov."
And when we went down to the lowlands between Multipol and Cervonoselsky, the crossfire began with anti-tank guided missiles, with "zushka", grenade launchers of 30-millimeter, automatic BMD cannons, small arms.
In front of me were four cars and behind three, in the end there were only two cars left.
The officer with the call sign "Lermontov" says that almost immediately at least 60 people were killed, dozens were wounded, many died later.
Surviving militants are now receiving medical treatment from those they have come to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give food, medicine.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and doomed them to certain death.
We were betrayed simply, they say.
The column, the whole battalion, to be destroyed.
In the battalion "Donbass" like many of his comrades, Alexey volunteered, because in the Ukrainian news told about the atrocities, which allegedly were committed in the southeast "separatists."
Already here Alexey saw a very different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk - and not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me and told me that there was mortar fire, that most likely it was the Ukrainian armed forces, - says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
We were not allowed out of Ilovaisk, they said we were in the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, I've already written a report about leaving.
We were immediately taken to Ilovaisk from the training camp.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were stuck in the "pot" near Ilovaisk.
Now some survivors admit that if time could be turned back, they would never join a punitive battalion.
All the captives were handed over by the militia to the DNR security forces.
Everyone will be tested for involvement in war crimes.
The region has set up a headquarters to limit the prices of products
A headquarters has been set up in Krasnoyarsk region, which, if necessary, will limit the increase in prices for products in the region's market.
The decree on the creation of this structure has already been signed.
The staff included members of the regional government, representatives of the executive branch and supervisory agencies.
Together they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the province.
Leading the Economy - Will Kiev reimburse Rosneft $140 million in losses?
The head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, said that the company estimates the damage from the shelling of the Lisichan refinery in Ukraine at $140 million.
He said this in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government on compensation," Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the modernized Lisichan refinery was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no fighting, there were no "entrenched rebels", but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial site.
In addition, the technological oil pumped into the pipes has disappeared," he said.
Recall, on July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisichansk refinery burned down the oil storage tank and destroyed the buildings of two warehouses.
Lisichan refinery is the main refinery in Ukraine, the first phase of the plant was commissioned in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichan refinery is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is capable of producing Euro-4 fuel as well as Euro-5 diesel fuel shipments.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisichan refinery were suspended due to its loss.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft acquired the Lisichan refinery along with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-BP.
The DPRK launched a short-range projectile towards the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media, it happened at about 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando Province, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
According to Interfax, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, the missile is believed to have landed in the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.
Ruble falls amid geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Exchange, the dollar rose by 3pc to 37.15 rubles, while the ruble fell to the bi-currency basket amid geopolitical tensions.
Trading on ETS on the dollar started with trades in the boundaries of 37.11-37.2 rubles/$1, on average for two minutes the rate is fixed at 37.16 rubles/$1, it is 4 kop. above the level of the previous close.
The euro exchange rate was 48.79 rubles per euro, which is 3pc higher than the previous close.
The price of the bi-currency basket added 3.5 kop. and amounted to 42.395 rubles.
The US dollar is trading 23pc higher than the official rate, while the euro is 16pc higher than the official rate.
The Russian market on Friday, August 29, continued a rapid decline, but there was no panic this time.
The ruble continued to become cheaper and even updated the historical high against the dollar.
Now investors are already playing back the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
For now, however, it's more like an artificial tantrum, bloated through the media, especially Western ones.
There are not many options for imposing new sanctions on Russia.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to weaken sharply against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains the determining factor.
However, if in the near future we do not see a new negative, both Russian indices and positions of the national currency can be adjusted.
Orenburg Airlines to sue Ideal Tour
Orenburg Airlines sued Ideal Tour for a total of 4.7 billion rubles.
These are two cases that will be held in October.
Different judges will consider the cases.
According to Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on August 14.
Its sum is just over 425 million rubles.
A hearing on it is scheduled for October 7.
The second application was filed on 18 August.
Its sum is 4.24 billion rubles.
A hearing on it is scheduled for October 2.
As reported to journalists in the Russian Union of the tourism industry, judges in cases are different.
In July, the media reported about the debts of "Ideal Tour" to "Orenburg Avilianies" in the amount of 1.5 billion rubles.
The general director of the airline, Viktor Sukin, talks about the sum of 1.6 billion rubles.
Aeroflot CEO Vitaly Saveliev calls an even bigger sum - two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to become more interesting for new users
Twitter's microblogging service has changed the process of user registration to quickly engage new members in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have thrown their microblogs.
Now new Twitter users will view a large number of re-branded accounts during registration to make up their reading circle right away.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests mentioned at registration.
At the same time, Twitter automatically ticks the subscription for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to shoot their own ticks, so as not to read those who are not interested in it.
If earlier users of the microblogging service saw only avatars of recommended users, now Twitter displays a sample of one of the blogger's popular tweets to help make an impression of the person.
This is the biggest change in the Twitter registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter is actively working on upgrading the service.
Such activity is primarily connected with the continued attempts of the service to achieve break-even.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in user base growth and a drop in reader activity.
The company at the moment desperately needs more loyal to the resource consumers, who, going once, would remain for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a steady stream of advertising funds.
Knowledge Day in Moscow will be chilly and rainy
The first of September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy all day long, meteorologists report.
The air temperature in Moscow will be from 16 to 18 degrees, in the suburbs - 13-18 degrees.
When cloudy with clearing weather in places will rain, the wind of the eastern quarter at the same time will be quite weak - only 3-8 meters per second.
Car recycling program resumed on September 1
From September 1, Russia resumes the program for the recycling of cars.
By December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As explained by the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other areas of support.
The program will affect all vehicles over six years of age.
The amount of compensation will be from 40,000 for a passenger car to 350,000 rubles per truck.
Previously, Russia already had a similar program of car recycling.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is assumed not only to dispose of cars for the subsequent discount, but also the possibility, if the car has reached the age of more than six years, to buy a new one at a discount when the old one is sold to the dealer, Interfax reports.
More than 16 billion rubles were spent on the previous federal recycling program, which was in force from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.
Thanks to it, the production rate of passenger cars in 2010 was about 1.2 million units (this is plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, known for the game Coming Out Simulator decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started work on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact has become widely known only now.
The game was inspired by the events in Ferguson, where protests are now taking place after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a name, will be how the informational coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in the areas where there are skirmishes between the police and the population.
The hero can take a different picture of what is happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he will shoot the scene so that the police will look like heroes, and the protesters - bandits, the police will begin to treat him better and let where the average person can not pass.
If he does not cover events differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a large-scale riot.
Points in the game will need to type with the help of Twitter hero, which will appear new subscribers, if the photos posted there will be popular.
The game has no name yet.
The release date and the platform on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, posted an image showing how the event might change depending on how the photo of it was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to dedicate it not to protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he began to collect material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media covering the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer that releases browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about the events from the biography of Case himself, is dedicated to how a bisexual teenager tries to tell about their relationship to homophobic parents.
Geletay draws Ukraine into the continuation of bloodshed
The call to prepare for the next "tens of thousands" of victims, Ukrainian Defense Minister Valery Geletay draws the people in the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
"Moscow, of course, drew attention to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valery Geletei, who declared the "completion of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists" and the beginning of the "Great Patriotic War", the losses of which will be counted "tens of thousands."
The degree of adequacy of the head of the ukrainian military department, who published the post on his Facebook page, is a subject for research of specialists not in the military field," the Statement of Russian Diplomats reads.
They hardly believe that such statements can belong to the Minister of Defense of a civilized state.
On its Facebook page, Ukraine's defense minister wrote on Monday: "Through unofficial channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if the resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
At the same time, he said that the "operation to liberate eastern Ukraine" has been completed.
Perez Hilton deleted all intimate pictures of the stars and apologized
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars have been engulfed in horror.
Hackers hacked primitive passwords in iCloud (data storage) in smartphones, after which their intimate pictures appeared on the site of blogger Perez Hilton.
Really, not for long.
Recall, the official representative of the star of "Hunger Games" Jennifer Lawrence has already reported the theft of photos from her cell phone, and also confirmed that all the pictures that "shine" on the web are authentic.
Perez Hilton - the creator of the eponymous tabloid site, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues on the shop floor for publishing their candid pictures, writes The Independent.
No, no one forced me to do that.
I haven't been contacted by their agents.
And now I'm going to delete candid photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice," the blogger wrote on Twitter.
However, all the candid photos of the stars have already spread on the web.

Tony Stewart crashes back on track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended little more than mid-race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the wall a second time after his right front tyre burst on lap 172, ending his performance.
Stewart drove his battered car to the garage and then walked out without talking to reporters.
His team leader Chad Johnston said 14 team members are upset but will now focus on next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better try and a better finish for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we can do better there.
Stewart first crashed into a wall earlier in Sunday night's race after colliding with Kyle Busch, which required repairs to the right side of his car.
"I started today with quite a lot of hope of successfully getting to the finish line," Johnston said, adding, "Just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded onto a tow truck, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car was hit and killed by another driver while racing on a dirt track in upstate New York.
He decided to come back this week and he needed to win either in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to take part in the Pursuit.
He returned to work during the investigation into the tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took to the track to express his displeasure with Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement officials said Friday that the investigation into the cause of the crash will continue for at least another two weeks.
No decision has been made on whether Stewart will be charged.
The three-time champion was greeted with loud cheers and applause as he was presented before the race.
Starting from 12th position, Stewart went in the first 10 at the beginning of the race, reaching the fourth position.
Then on lap 122 after the restart was Bush's no.
Car 18 went off the trajectory at the exit of Turn 2 and crashed into Stewart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell behind to 21st position.
Sobchak and Vitorgan have breakfast with cigarettes with Yuvanetsky in Odessa
Ksenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV presenter did not fail to announce on her Instagram.
However, one photo was very surprised and very confused fans of the couple.
The picture was taken by Yuvanetsky.

Bulgaria's Prison Officers Hold National Protest
Hundreds of prison officers from all over Bulgaria held a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the return of the old working conditions, which had recently been changed.
The salary increase is also included in the list of requirements, which will be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, officers protested against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the prison officers' union has met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice on several occasions, no agreement has been reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
Negotiations are continuing, the head of the General Directorate for The Execution of Punishments, Rosen Shchelyazkov, told BNR.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest of the prison service.
Army controls Thailand's new government
General Prayuth (right) appointed Defence Minister Prawit Wongsuwan (left)
The military ruler and prime minister of Thailand, General Prayuth Chan-ocha, announced the composition of the country's new cabinet, with more than a third of the posts held by retired generals or generals.
The army received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Prayuth Chan-ocha was formally confirmed as prime minister after thailand's king formally approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to the post.
The 60-year-old military man, who seized power in the country in a bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for prime minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
Earlier, the army appointed members of parliament.
According to Prayuth Chan-ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations in which protesters demanded the resignation of the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.
Officially, Prayuth Chan-ocha will be interim prime minister as the military plans to hold general elections in late 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to consolidate its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22
amid the complete paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army ousted Yinglyk's brother Shinawatra Thaksin as prime minister.
Both are popular with the rural population, especially in the northern parts of the country, which has repeatedly ensured their success in the elections.
However, many members of the middle class and the capital's elite joined the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one said that the mussel salad will be better, I did not promise you this, jokes the waitress from the new palm brasserie.
We have to formally admit that this is indeed the case, but the mind and stomach remain adamant.
After all, everyone has known for a long time: we say "Belgium" - we mean mussels, we say "mussels" - we mean "Belgium."
Restaurateurs like to think deeply that the success of the institution depends on three factors: location, location and once again location.
There are places that are located not that well, but even excellent, but some unlucky.
In short, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe "Gorodok" (in honor of the same TV show), then "Odessa-mother", and also the restaurant "Beaujolais" and beer "Friendship."
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, and Belgian.
Above the ground is placed only the tip of the iceberg: a bar and a couple of tables, the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But here it is fun, as in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, multi-colored chairs, instead of windows - TVs, where mermaid girls swim.
Belgian institutions in St. Petersburg are no longer a novelty, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of draft beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 liters) and countless bottled (170-1550 rubles).
The kompany-positive waitress cheerfully presents the menu, saying that "mussels are hearty big seeds", and it should be noted: it is the service, despite some shortcomings - the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpectedly on execution.
Well, who, for example, is given to predict that the meatloaf with Walloon prunes (280 rubles) - in fact carpaccio, sliced to the same thin that parchment paper compared to it will seem ugly matter ugly thick.
You can feel at least some taste only if you warm up at once half-tar.
It's even worse with salads.
The classic Liege (260) would be the most correct to recognize a crime against the Belgian people: some rotten iceberg, boiled once a long time ago potatoes, sour Kenyan beans, snub chips from bacon plus for some reason pickled onions.
With such a Liege salad you would not wish to meet anyone!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If you could close your eyes on the undercooked quarters of cherry tomatoes or overcooked mushrooms, why do mussels look as if they had been defrosted and boiled several times in their lifetime!
After all, I already know: there are quite normal White-American mussels!
They are served in pots "in the sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
The half-dozen sauces, the one made of white wine, celery and carrots, frankly did not work.
Vegetables are, and the aroma is absent, and whether there was wine, and remained a mystery.
But good for mussels frites with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken waterzoo here - not chowder, thick to such an extent that depending on the mood you can decide the first or second dish in front of you, but just a nice creamy soup.
It was stated that the local chef cooks rabbit in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
In fact, the situation was diametrically opposed: rosemary drowned out everything.
It seemed that this rabbit during his lifetime was fed exclusively rosemary bushes, why the meat has acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time to the rabbit's leg was attached wonderful - no, just an excellent pear in a caramelized crust.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also hearty - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce turned out to be too watery, and the waffles are dry.
But the manager who came to the table asked very informally about the dining experience.
So we should come back again.
The dollar rose to 37 rubles on news of new sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar by calculations "tomorrow" by 10:29 Moscow time grew by 26.9 cents and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the euro rose by 30 cents - to 48.73 rubles, data of the Moscow Exchange show.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 cents to the level of the previous close and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar peaked on February 19, 2009 - then it was worth 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House announced that U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is long-term, both paired with the euro and paired with the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark, - says senior analyst of Alpari Anna Bodrova.
Everything related to Ukraine will be reflected in the courses in one way or another.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumors about the invasion of troops are not confirmed on any side, but the market turned out to be very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news was crossed out yesterday.
The week, according to the experts, will close near these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine - all these are links of the same chain.
Inflation is also forecast to accelerate, with 5 to 10% added to current prices for autumn.
Soon, in addition, will run out of seasonal vegetables and fruits, and there will be some vacuum, while the networks refocus on other suppliers.
"The dollar came to the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and came back, there is no such powerful hysteria - comments the head of the market analysis department "Opening Broker" Konstantin Bushuyev.
They will still be looking at whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The ruble, according to him, weakened sharply after the end of the tax season, then news on Ukraine, besides, the Central Bank last week said that by the end of the year it completely moves to a floating rate and refuses any currency interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was no different from the previous ones during this month, everyone was frightened by the mark of 37 rubles, - the analyst continues.
And so, in terms of turnover nothing powerful happened.
Disturbing times for the foreign exchange market were, I recall, when at the end of January there was an increased demand for the currency, as well as on March 3, when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
UfS IC also sees the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, it is the growth of the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as increasing the competitiveness of domestic producers by increasing the cost of imports, said Alexey Kozlov, chief analyst at UFS IC.
The negative points include the rise in the price of imported goods and services.
Sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressures and, as a result, cause an increase in the cost of borrowing, which, in turn, hinders the development of the country's economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smooths the decline in the share prices expressed in rubles.
For example, the MIMB Index fell by 1.67% during Thursday's trading and the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative size of the decline in indices is due to the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is explained by a massive desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, gradually emotions fade away, and ruble quotes partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," - notes Alexey Kozlov.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
A British woman reported that she had spent many years thinking she was going to die after a misdiagnosis.
Karyn Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years left to live after she was diagnosed with another condition.
In fact, she had Charcot-Marie-Tuta disease (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that cause nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said the misdiagnosis was a common problem among people with CMET because so little was known about the condition.
Some 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have CMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, insecure gait and clenched toes.
Patients may feel numb or pain, and the condition is not cured and progresses, which means that symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich's Ataxia (AF) - a condition for which the prognosis was very bad.
Rogers thought she would be confined to a wheelchair by the time she was 18 and would die before she turned 30.
The mother-of-two, now 51, said: 'As a child I knew I couldn't do what others did.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I could never ride a roller or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied a lot at school because of the way I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release her Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked into the medical card when her doctor left the room and it was written that she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I stuck my nose where I shouldn't, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about the condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and experienced the most terrible panic possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in that span.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she turned 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, "My darling, I don't think you have this disease because you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much less life-threatening way.
After several genetic examinations, she was found to have AMM.
"When he explained what CMIT was, I thought I had pulled out a lucky ticket," she said.
The charity CMIT UK has announced a month of information about CHT to try to draw attention to the disease.
Tax burden on Washington zone entrepreneurs grows as economy recovers
A rebounding economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country increased moderately last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study released last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to the state's coffers and locally in fiscal 2013, a 3.8 percent increase from the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on business by state and local level increased by 4.3 percent last year, to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after years of declines in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose faster, 4.3 percent, than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by the professional services firm, Ernst and Young, and the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's tax revenue comes from firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the lowest amount of tax revenue, proportionately, from entrepreneurs.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is driven by a return to the value of real estate companies, the researchers said, which has raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 percent.
While large states such as California, New York and Texas account for a large share of these revenues, the same seems to be happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent from the previous year.
But the observed return on property values has no similar effect on the growth of tax revenue across the state and locally in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of company tax bills.
Companies in Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of state and local tax bills in the form of real estate taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, is owned by either the government or a nonprofit that doesn't pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Tax Center.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that exist in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
The income of entrepreneurs also seems to be on the mend, according to these data.
Companies in the region declared $2.3 billion in state income tax, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.
Although trends are directed in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three localities.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the national average of 4.3 percent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.
In Virginia alone, there has been a lower-than-average rise in tax revenues, or 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of the three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) of 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the district it is relatively high - 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower taxes for entrepreneurs across the state and locally and, in general, a more favorable climate for business taxes than Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbor from the south.
North Carolina recently signed legislation reducing the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same as in Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet tax revenue targets next year, the law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs to even 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be feeling better and thus paying more taxes across the state and locally, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners - the transitional structure under which most small firms are arranged - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much faster rate of growth than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenue across the country is likely to continue this year, with state and local tax receipts up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may lag behind, as the decline in federal spending affects the labor market in the region.
Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home judo world championship brought two silver and seven bronze medals to the Russian team.
According to this indicator, the Russians lost only the main favorite of the competition - the national team of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who competed in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in an equal final fight with Baldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation decided only one remark received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian team - on Tuesday three medals were won at once.
In the men's competition in the category up to 66 kg silver went to Mikhail Pulyaev, and bronze - Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian lost to the 2011 and 2013 world champion Masashi Ebinum.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost to his compatriot at the quarter-final stage, won the consolation tournament and won the bronze medal.
In the women's tournament of up to 52 kg, Natalia Kuzyutina also reached the third step of the podium.
In the semifinals, she lost to reigning world champion Mailinda Kelmendi of Kosovo, who competed under the flag of the International Judo Federation at the championships and successfully defended the title.
In the dispute for bronze Kuzyutina won against Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament still admitted that the third place - it is not what she expected.
Again, the obstacle on the Russian's way to gold was Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzutina earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg, took bronze in the Russian team's piggy bank.
In the quarterfinals, his offender was former Moldovan representative Viktor Skovortsov, who now plays for the UAE team.
However, then the Russian won two fights and became the winner of the award.
Mogushkov played at the home championship with an ankle injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he will take a break in the competition.
As for the ex-Moldovan Skvortsov, he also reached the bronze medal at this tournament.
Interestingly, his other compatriot, who took sports citizenship of the UAE, Ivan Remarenko with bronze finished the performance in the category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which was won by Ivan Nifontov in the under 81 kg category.
In a tough battle of the small final, he defeated Frenchman Alan Schmitt due to his opponent's comments.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at the tournament, but the Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Askov, and the Russian team this medal was guaranteed: his opponent in the consolation final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the opponent question was unable to reach the mats due to injury.
Men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was put in the piggy bank of the national team Renat Saidov, who performed in the category of over 100 kg.
In the consolation final he won a clean victory over the Brazilian David Mura.
Thus ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian national teams - both men's and women's - were among the main contenders for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, the fair sex was unlucky - they did not get to the medal.
But Russian judokas won team silver.
In the decisive confrontation, they lost 2-3 in a hard-fought battle with the main favorites of the competition - the team of Japan.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after a clean victory of Khan-Magomedov and a strong-willed - Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiyev (100) could not cope with their Japanese rivals in the heavier weight categories.
In the same scenario, the bronze match in the women's tournament developed, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, lost to the Japanese - 2-3.
Russian President Vladimir Putin was present at the team competitions in Chelyabinsk, and after the tournament he congratulated the men's team with silver.
"Second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could become champions," Putin said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the ancestors of judo - there is nothing shameful here.
But I'm sure you can win from them.
The Russian national team performed much better at the home World Cup than a year ago in competitions of this level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isayev.
We are all, of course, great maximalists.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is in the top eight, he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in such a sport as judo," Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko summed up the tournament, quoted by the press service of the championship.
The Japanese team was expected to become the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various dignity, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.

Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had had a cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "severe".
The response has been broad, including numerous online support from the likes of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
All kings can
On sale is the debut album of the band Royal Blood - a new hope of British rock, which brought rock duets from clubs directly to the stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo have only been on stage for a year, but already have a nomination for the BBC Music Award, a warm-up tour at Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the dressing room of a New York concert by Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut self-titled album a few months before the release received 100,000 pre-orders, and the contract for its release lies in the portfolio of major label Warner Music.
Given the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is out of the ordinary, because it is not about the new Lana Del Rey or the next sweet-voice representative of the "new R'n'B", but about a duo of bullish-looking Brits playing with the level of volume and intensity that was last in vogue a couple of decades ago.
In general, the stakes for the first album due to all the above circumstances were particularly high and have already been quite justified.
The duo not in vain took a name, which before that could encroach only very desperate hairy metalworkers, and the blood of which kings flows, as they think, in their veins, too, understandable.
It is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past level of Led zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aims to shake the stagnant blood of British rock, bringing it to a new height.
It is probably too early to make predictions about the success of this enterprise, but it is possible to assert something already.
A dozen songs that took thirty-and-a-half minutes is not so much a demonstration of the phenomenal composer's talent as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the advantages of individual numbers, of course, can not be denied: say, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not by a melodic line, but by a drum part.
Musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier to knock than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing track "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at the party of heavy rock fans, but when playing in a row they merge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And it's not necessarily a bad thing, even the other way around.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they do not pretend to the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (rather marked as the successors of Mot'rhead), but have brought numerous rock duets out of the ghetto of indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, created for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, it is obviously cramped.
The secret is partly in the cunning use of bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format, invented at the beginning of the zeros The White Stripes.
However, it's not just about the instruments, it's about the approach to songwriting.
Heroes of the retrorock of zero with great difficulty climbed beyond the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance to admit themselves not just epigons, but independent creative units.
Royal Blood already now sound so powerful and brazen that this pressure successfully drapes some secondary and stubbornness of musical material.
And after all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: The online store - and video producer, and a hundred other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US 970 million).
This news came as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and this combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as a Justin.tv, has set a goal of being a streaming service of a general nature - a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; "YouTube is for real-time games," according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "Let's Play," a genre of videos in which know-it-alls give (mostly old) games, as in "Mysterious Theatre," are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is mentioned often when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch has been met without much interest, a classic example of an entrenched technology company buying out a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that he was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmett Shire: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us reach them faster."
Another mystery, to be honest, is twitch's incredible success.
Snobs like me who say they'd rather play sports than watch it, it's hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of picking up a joystick.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3am as she crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a stranger get 20 shots to the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are designed for one person, so watching them shoot without controlling the angle of view yourself can be a recipe for a headache worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speed passes, in which the Rogers Of our electronic age finish the whole game in record time, entertain.
But if we are not talking about a virtuoso game or humor, it is unlikely that his channel Twitch at all will be interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon make money from this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch would curl up in Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could just absorb Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would love to get: the crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As the head of Twitch Shire said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming" and this channel shows no signs of withering, even - oh - as a spectacular sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed in the 2004 attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
We talked to the surviving hostages - almost all the students are now, with the parents of the victims, with the custodian of the cemetery - city of angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the committee "Mother Beslan" Susanna Dudieva, who took part in the special operation employee of the Ministry of Emergency Situations - says the correspondent of the department "Society" Elizaveta Antonova, who worked on the special project.
Having already returned to Moscow, we met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the President on the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with Vyacheslav Bocharov, an officer of the "B" of the Russian Federal Security Service.
What shocked me most during my time working on this topic is that Beslan didn't seem to have been around for ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for all who have anything to do with it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
Impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But Beslan cannot be forgotten, and I hope we have coped with our task," Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the infographic studio of Rambler Co, which has been working for the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's time in power.
North Korea launches short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile into the waters of the Sea of Japan, Renhap reported.
The launch took place around 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando Province, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
The missile is believed to have landed in the Sea of Japan, flying about 220 km, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea said.
MPs proposed to speed up the entry into force of the law on personal data
If the initiative is successful, the data of Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015
The State Duma has introduced a draft law providing for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activities of the lower house.
It was sponsored by State Duma deputies Vadim Moneyn, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov ("United Russia"), Vladimir Parakhin ("Fair Russia") and Alexander Yushchenko (COMMUNISTF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to more prompt and effective enforcement of the rights of Russian citizens to the safety of personal data and compliance with the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The law, which is in a hurry for parliamentarians, obliges to keep personal data of Russians processed through the Internet in the territory of the Russian Federation.
It also makes it mandatory to record, organize, store, store, refine and extract personal data of Russian citizens, in databases located in Russia, as well as specifying the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right on the basis of a court decision to restrict access to information processed in violation of Russian law in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of offending sites - an automated information system "Register of violators of the rights of subjects of personal data."
This law was adopted by the State Duma in the summer.
The bill was sponsored by Andrei Lugovoi and Vadim Moneyn from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the Communist Party.
Moneyn and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in Russia will have to pay rent
Commenting on the bill introduced today in the State Duma, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy Leonid Levin said that he sees no problems for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own repositories of personal data of Russians in the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "from Rostelecom, which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and already provide their servers, from Mail Group, from Western companies that now provide their servers."
"In addition, there are several independent data centers ready to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in the Russian Federation, I see no problem - they will get technological opportunities for accommodation," Levin concluded.
Controversial bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed concern that if the bill was passed, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking services for flights and hotels.
According to the association, "the bill deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation the right to dispose of their own data imperatively determining that their record, systemization, etc. should be provided only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation."
The RAEC statement stresses that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user about where the recording is carried out, to organize his personal data.
In this case, he will be able to choose on what territory these actions will be carried out.
The adoption of such bills on the "localization" of personal data in other countries has led to the withdrawal of global services and to significant economic losses.
The participant of the ice water bucket tested dislocated her jaw

Militia handed over more than 400 prisoners to Ukrainian military
The "Army of Novorossiya" claims to have shot down the Ukrainian Su-27, and accuses the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
As of 10:00 on September 1, the militia handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax by a representative of the press service of the "Army of Novorossiya."
He added that "the air defense forces in the area of mereshka town shot down a Su-27 aircraft, which violated the ceasefire agreements."
According to the source, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions during the shelling of Luhansk airport.
The spokesman of the press service noted that the militia managed to damage two Ukrainian Air Force helicopters at one of the field airfields overnight, as well as destroy two armored personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
"The losses in the enemy's manpower - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, surrendered 13 people," - the representative of the headquarters summed up.
Interfax does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the "people's republics" of Donbass announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side as part of the ceasefire of 223 captive servicemen and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, at night, the DNR army, according to the "Army of Novorossiya," "stopped the attempt of the National Guardsmen in violation of previous agreements to withdraw heavy equipment from the encirclement area."
At that time, the militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in a fleeting battle, the seizure of six tanks and the disarming of 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored fighting vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded
Late last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers was surrounded by militias in the Ilovaisk area of Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the leadership of the "people's republics" to release Ukrainian servicemen from the encirclement.
The DNR agreed to do this on the condition that the enemy surrenders weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of soldiers began to leave the encircled settlements on Saturday morning.
According to Semyon Semenchenko, the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defense battalion Donbass, 14 other people left the cauldron on Sunday night.
Semenchenko wrote on his Facebook page that the Ukrainian wounded are "in captivity at the 137th Regiment of the 32nd Division of the Russian Federation and 9th Tank Brigade of the Russian Federation," where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry and defense ministry denied reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will retaliate if the EU imposes new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
The statement of the Russian Foreign Ministry says that the "conclusions" of the European Council of August 30 demonstrated the inability of the EU member states to overcome the inertia of their reckless support of the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, based on "absolutely unsubstantiated allegations about the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of that country," according to the agency's website.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is influenced by countries that are interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full"-fledged "dialogue between the warring parties," the ministry said.
Also on the website of the agency notes that now there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in the Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster unfolded, as well as the increasing number of civilian casualties.
It should be reminded that within the next seven days in the European Union it is planned to develop concrete proposals for sanctions against Russia.
At the same time, EU representatives work closely with American officials.
They are expected to correlate the measures introduced on the period of action and the degree of rigidity.
New EU sanctions could affect the energy and financial sectors.
The Australian government also announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the fields of defense, finance and oil and gas industry.
Tricky ways to save on university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to second year, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from undergrads, offering them nominal compensation so that they would postpone their sale.
"My maths analysis textbook, which usually costs $180, I got a semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A cookie," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature for last semester would have cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and teaching supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online shopping and creative ideas like The Schroeder System.
Book rental is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often costs significantly less than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, says book rental has doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented during the last spring semester, said Trevor Meyer, vice president of Nibo.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here's an introductory course on the best ways to make a good deal.
Buying from an online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hosttler costs about $290 on the list price, but the new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the Chegg.com website, which specializes in selling textbooks.
Buying a used
If you don't mind other people's marks or damage, second-hand textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" sells for $93.49 in second-hand on Chegg.com.
Matt Cassidy, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, said he paid Amazon.com 42 cents for a used copy of the textbook "Strategic Media Solutions: Understanding the Business Side of the Advertising Business."
The book sold for $48 new.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the Wallless College at the University of Massachusetts at Emhurst, suggest that students should ask their professors if previous editions should not be used.
Sometimes updates are inconsequential for classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small fraction of the cost of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com owned by eBay Inc. is a popular alternative for buying used books.
hire
It is worth considering how to rent textbooks, if you treat them well enough, do not forget to return them and do not want to keep them after the course is completed.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent a "Mathematical Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you pick up the books, including any fines you may issue for tagging, stressing and damage.
If you rent a book, remember that if you don't return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes these books are actually rented, buying an electronic license for a certain period from distributors, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes and Noble Inc.
Hiring "Mathematical Analysis" on the site Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the best prices, as many classical works can now be downloaded for free, while literature on science and engineering can be very expensive.
No matter what, take a look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start his studies at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the price of the book, as it ensures that you are looking for exactly the text you need.
Before you order online, says Gault, be sure to check whether the book is actually in stock.
It wasn't easy for him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was delayed for four weeks, and he eventually paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin declares complete inefficiency of Far East Development Fund
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, established two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.
"15 billion rubles remained on deposits," the president said.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to accelerate the approval of the list of territories ahead of development in the Far East.
He reminded that the draft law necessary for the creation of THE Tors should be submitted to the State Duma this fall.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, has not approved the list of territories ahead of development in the Far East until July 1, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin has also formulated the main tasks for the development of the Far East.
Among them, increasing the transport accessibility of the region, the removal of infrastructure restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create proposals to attract additional investments to the region, as well as to form territories of advanced development, which should become competitive in relation to key business centers of the Asia-Pacific region, the President stressed.
Earlier it was reported that the territory of advanced development can be replaced by the EEK.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" couldn't save box office
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" returned less than $30 million from its $90-million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: The Woman Worth Killing" returned only $12 million from its $70-million budget.
"Home Video" with Cameron Diaz brought in only $14.6 million in its first weekend, while children's films such as "How to Train Your Dragon 2" also disappointed in revenue.
The Telegraph's film critic Robbie Collin's article points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be the poor quality of the films themselves.
Colleen called 2014 the "worst" year in history for children's films, and called "How to Train Your Dragon 2" a barely "functioning" sequel to fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film released in the summer at least 2,000 copies between Memorial Day in May and July 20, for 2013 and for that year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both moviegoers and film critics, suggest that the harvest of this year's films are similar in caliber to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in the changing viewership habits and the growing popularity of streaming Internet services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on the soon-to-be-released Disney film "The Jungle Book," told the Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase what happened before.
Unlike the current drop in box office in Hollywood, Netflix's revenue from the streaming service reached $1.2 billion, nearly double last year's figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized studios for relying too much on comic book franchises, and predicted the "collapse" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that there was some truth to his gloomy predictions.
With several potential box office hits expected to be released in the summer of 2015, including "Avengers: Age of Ultron," "Minions" and "Jurassic Park," other members of the film industry are more optimistic.
"X-Men" producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in box office "cyclical," telling The Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer will be the highest-grossing summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Food sanctions do not frighten the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine Russian suppliers - it's a terrible dream.
And in general, the catering still prefers to replace banned imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"It is better to eat low-salt cucumber than bad mozzarella", - the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio laments about the quality of cheeses offered to him by suppliers in return for Italian.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ended in the restaurant first, they have a short shelf life.
Parmesan supplies should be enough for another couple of months.
What to do?
Switch to Russian?
In 2005 I was at the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear: shocking memories do not let him go until now.
The meat was lying on the trolleys just 30 centimeters from the floor!
There's cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe things have changed there now.
But the other day I was given a fish from the Far East.
So it turned out to be rotten!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many of the usual things for Italy for the Russian manufacturer are out of the ordinary.
A few years ago I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, hang meat in a refrigeration chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It must hang to become soft, so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with local beef.
Then I was asked: where did you get such tender meat?
I said, it's yours, Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" in the kitchen hangs a stop list, which shows the missing products: French oysters, sea urchin.
The chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" and the bar "Strelka" Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced with oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses the restaurant will buy Swiss.
However, Regis also becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Color cabbage - 200 rubles!
I said, "Why, on what basis does it cost so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make money, too."
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
Far Eastern oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, can you imagine how much their shell weighs?
For the price it turns out that it is superdeletas.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of horror stories for foreign chefs.
Standard story: "The first three months were all good, then the quality plummeted."
The main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many restaurants in European cuisine do not know what will happen to them when the cheese is run out

Sanctioned menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the use of separate economic measures to ensure The security of Russia, which is mainly called food sanctions.
It is forbidden to import beef, pork, meat and by-products from poultry, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurts, cottage cheese, cheeses, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants began to checharda with suppliers: the prices of products have increased, it is urgent to look for analogues from other countries.
Most of all it will affect expensive restaurants with monocies of France, Italy, Spain, in which products were supplied directly from "mother" countries.
The catering company had to rebuild before.
For example, when in early 2014 Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers supplied beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New ealand.
But the sanctions of the summer of 2014 were much more serious.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree that remove from the ban fry Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for sowing.
Italian Valerio hopes that the sanctions can be eased.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist in conditions of uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of The Largest Suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
"Expensive restaurants will have to change the menu to what local farmers and other countries produce," said Sergei Mironov, a restaurateur and owner of the restconsult agency.
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such chefs, and the development of a new menu can take two or three months.
Trigel from the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" is ready for this: you will have to give up 10-15% of dishes, another half of the menu - to recycle.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine already begin to replace dishes, such as steak of marbled beef - on beef strogan, says Sergei Mironov.
"Cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," says Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of East-West.
Cream and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the USA can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway - salmon, salmon, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of european fruits and vegetables can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, it will be easier for budget chain restaurants to rebuild than the premium segment: it is unlikely that there were gourmets who can distinguish Italian mozzarella from the Russian one.
Although it will be difficult for Ginza Project establishments, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace him," Mironov said.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the lack of owners in the country.
The owners of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine cafes emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European ones
But there are a lot of restaurants, which are practically not affected by sanctions.
These include establishments with cuisine from CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine," says Khatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the Wai Mea Cafe.
All cheeses are made for us in Russia, at the heart of many dishes - chicken fillet, exotic greens we do not use."
Kolbai has not yet removed a single dish from the menu.
Timur Lansky, the owner of the restaurants "Chaykhon N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions also do not confuse: he will have to change only lamb for New zealand.
If Russia establishes imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win the price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, - he says.
From the CIS it is cheaper to get tenderloin, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
At the same time, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About Uzbek tomatoes everyone knows that they are tasty, sweet.
No one says that about Spanish.
After the sanctions were imposed, the representative of the Ministry of Agricultural Development of Uzbekistan, Olimba Artykov, said that he plans to double the export of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the sanctions were imposed.
Fast food restaurants that responded to the "Money" request are also quite calm in responding to the sanctions.
McDonald's press service said that localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of subway Russia's suppliers department, about 80% of the network buys products in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In "Teremka" "sanctions products" generally occupied no more than 4%.
The Vooker noodles were not affected by the sanctions.
KFC, Burger King and Little Potato did not respond to a request for comment, but other market participants say that the degree of localization of Burger King is significantly less than that of McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish restaurateurs are ready to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far Eastern
On his hunchback
In the meantime, restaurateurs complain that because of the increase in demand, prices are rising even for local products.
"The prices for products for "Grabley" have increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant "Cherry Mio" - twice," - says restaurateur Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of meals will increase by 5-10%, Kolbya admits.
"East-West does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have risen by 10-15% since the beginning of August."
"Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled pork prices," complains Sergey Rak, deputy ceo of Stardogs.
Chicken ham rose by 35%.
We are waiting for prices from China, maybe they will cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8%.
Now it is very undesirable to raise prices, - says Rak.
According to statistics, the growth of catering revenue for the second quarter of 2014 - only 1.8%.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is unclear how quickly: so far, most restaurateurs have stocked up on products for the next two months in the hope of waiting out the price changes.
But no one knows what will happen in two months.
On the square in front of the Moscow City Hall stands a dozen tents decorated with greenery and wood.
In the center of the stage, musicians play a waltz.
This is a festival of regional products with the hilarious title "There is time to eat."
"We were going to make a celebration of local food for a long time, and then it was the sanctions, we rushed, organized a festival," - says one of the organizers.
Backstage with the musicians, the Greek chef Anastas prepares a salad of pasta and homemade sweets, the other day there was a master class on cooking borscht with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tents - an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, venison from Salekhard, vegetables from the "Lenin State Farm" near Moscow, cheeses from the besed Italian Jay Close.
"Salmon for restaurants can be safely replaced with another salmon fish from the Far East," says Philip Galkin, owner of the "His People" fish shop.
We catch nerka, ketu, kizhucha, humpback, chavacha - "royal salmon."
Yes, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because they're wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take it in your hands, it doesn't even move.
And you can't hold our Far Eastern salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian mozzarella domestic
In the window of his tent are shrimp with the tag "Magadan", cod, omul, muksun, mussels from Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin is sure that it is high time to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, fishing in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 - about 800,000 tons.
Shop "His People" has been working since 2012, sells fish through an online store, before the imposition of sanctions served another half dozen restaurants, such as "Simple Things."
Now Galkin received applications from 15 more restaurants.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, - he is hot.
We bothered, tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheaper several times, and delivery - it's a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
As a confirmation in The Galkin's tent, I prepare a portion of "Philadelphia" with a keta.
Unlike rolls with salmon these have to chew longer, but the consciousness that this fish is ours, domestic, gives strength.
On the site of the shop "His people" there are even rolls of halibut and sea bass.
In sushi bars, however, to replace Norwegian salmon prefer Chilean.
Galkin explains this by the fact that chefs are lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
"Russian fish suppliers have not offered us yet," - gives his explanation of the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitry Yevseyev.
The situation with other products is about the same: Russian manufacturers could occupy a vacant niche, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project Boris Akimov, now we can talk more about importing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large multinational corporations, which have strong logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace banned imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will benefit primarily large producers of other countries," Akimov said.
However, in the last month the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
As a result of mass unscheduled inspections, Rospotrebnadzor temporarily suspended the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg.
"We are studying the essence of the claims to determine the actions necessary to open restaurants to visitors as soon as possible," The McDonald's press office told Money.
In fact, no one understands what will happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be experienced, - says on condition of anonymity an employee of the company engaged in restaurant consulting.
If McDonald's starts closing all over the country, the scenario will be very different.
"Europrotocol" instead of the help of the traffic police
Payments on the casco can be received without the help of the traffic police - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the "europrotocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft directive according to which from September 1 this year to receive payments for the casco insured motorist will be able to do without a certificate of traffic police.
However, we are talking only about cases where the accident was registered under the "europrotocol" without the participation of the traffic police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the accident, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the set limit and both drivers have reached an agreement in the question of who is responsible for the accident.
From August 2, the limit of payments under the "europrotocol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions it will be raised to 400,000 rubles.
The bottom line is that often even with minor injuries, in a situation where an accident can be issued by "europrotocol", drivers who got into an accident, call DPS.
After all, if there was a policy, it was impossible to get a refund on it without a certificate of traffic police.
The parameters outlined in the draft guidance are designed to remove this obstacle to the introduction of the "euro protocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for a cascading in connection with an accident, issued without traffic police officers, should not be lower than the limit on the "europrotocol".
But at the same time it can not be higher than the limit defined in the insurance contract of the casco.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically able to unload both DPS and road employees.
But, most likely, it will not delight neither motorists nor insurers.
The latter are already talking about the serious threat of the growth of fraud, which can lead to the introduction of new rules of payments on cascading.
As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for hours for the inspector to make a minor accident, because it is so reliable.
And it is not yet known what will be easier - to defeat the scammers or convince drivers of the reliability of the "europrotcol".
Savings certificate will be made personal and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban the bearer's savings certificates, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of irrevocable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban the bearer's savings certificates.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as the rates here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that the bearer's savings certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank, as there is no need to make deductions to the Deposit Insurance Agency (DEPOSIT Insurance Agency) fund.
The piquancy of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to the ACB, control 98% of the profile market, will suffer from it.
And the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency's calculations, is about 3.5%.
The problem, the ACB explains, is that customers of a small bank who bought such a certificate, in case of revocation of his license, try to get money in the ACB.
Some savers, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates for the bearer, can assume that their investments are insured.
The justified absence of insurance payments on these certificates in the event of the revocation of the bank's license can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency, there were cases when holders of certificates tried to recover insurance compensation through the court," the AWU said.
The problem, of course, is far-fetched.
After all, no one will pay buyers certificates anyway, because they do not have the right to compensation from the state by law.
If it were that the instrument is not insured in the ACB, with it would be banned and metal accounts, which citizens' funds are counted in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but their existence is not yet attempted.
The fact is, most likely, that bearer certificates are a very convenient security, which can actually act as a quasi-money.
At the same time, their movement is almost beyond control: any client of the bank can buy a certificate, transfer to any citizen, and before cashing such a certificate can change many owners.
It is no coincidence that the bill stipulates that the savings certificate must be a necessary security, which should be stored in the depository.
And to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right of early repayment.
That is, an analogue of irrevocable contribution, which bankers have long dreamed of, is introduced.
NATO Summit: First protests in Nyport and Cardiff
Protests were held over the weekend by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
Hundreds gathered in Newport city centre on Saturday for an anti-NATO march.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, around 150 people gathered outside Cardiff Town Hall for what has been described as anti-Semitism.
Stephen Fairclow followed developments over the weekend and spoke to protesters who came from everywhere from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the terrorist group Islamic State, ITAR-TASS reported August 31, citing a decision taken after a meeting of representatives of the German government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany will reportedly send 30 portable Milan anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Deliveries will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On September 1, Mrs. Merkel will make a government statement in the Bundestag on this topic.
So far, Germany has not supplied its weapons to hotspots.
Opinions of German residents on sending weapons to Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop Islamic State fighters, while others fear that the weapons could eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militiamen hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militiamen hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, ITAR-TASS reported August 31.
According to available data, this happened in the Gulf of Taganrog near the settlements of Shyrokyne and Bezomeny (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media report the shelling of two coast guard boats.
It is specified that the incident took place today at about 16:20 Moscow time.
Teenagers were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
TWO bushwalkers have been flown by helicopter to safety after spending the night stranded in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went camping shortly after noon on Sunday at Govettes Lip in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8pm when they did not return home.
A search team was dispatched, which included local police and rescue teams, and the pair were found about 11pm near Brideal Vale Falls.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and bruised his head.
Officers stayed with the pair overnight and were hoisted on a winch on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance in a stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Met two unions
The summit talks in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the leaders of the future Eurasian
Even though the situation around Ukraine is urgent, the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot problems".
Whether such a structure can work effectively is unclear; but it is clear who removed the cream from this summit.
The questions on this matter fell away on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, followed by other Eurasians and Europeans, saw the new President Lukashenko in the TV news.
The Belarusian leader showed an example of honed courtesy, it was the behavior of a man who had just snatched the jackpot - and was planning a decent old age in high society.
How Lukashenko's Maidan helped
The arrival in Minsk of three main European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf is not just the legitimization of the president with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full subject of European politics and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Denis Melyantsov, a senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, is confident that brussels will no longer be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met tete-a-tete with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will be thawed further," he told Ogonku.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the Belarusian authorities started preparing for the breakout long before the November Maidan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
"We have achieved results with the EU - successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernization - the interlocutor "Fire" - and negotiations on international security were held with the United States.
The United States even lifted a few sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction to them by the leadership of Belarus only spurred this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for punishing pro-Russian militias in Donbass with all rigor, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk has not left either the Customs Union or the CSTO, and the Russian airbase is located in Baranovich.
Brussels and Washington have noticed Minsk's balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated it, Belarusian experts believe.
How successful Lukashenko's move towards political diversification will be will be seen by how often in the near future Minsk will have to host meetings in the format of the EU-TS.
The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy Catherine Ashton could not immediately answer questions about what Brussels expects from the relationship in the new format.
Ashton spokeswoman Maya Kosyancic only told Fire that this topic is not a priority against the background of the issues of war and peace.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan could become the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The tar drop for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that it turned out that he was personally asked about it by representatives of the European Union.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties do not mind that Minsk remains the central platform for meetings both in the format of Russia--OSCE-Ukraine, and at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the "last dictator of Europe" acquires the status of quite a handshake European leader who helps solve the global problem.
European farmer's best friend
The composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, pushed to the conclusion: the main reason for the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the schedule of future negotiations on gas supplies and overcoming the fears of the CU countries under the agreement on Ukraine's association with the EU looks like an achievement more ambitious than peaceful declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Karl De Gucht, however, said eu representatives "came to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, not the other way around."
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine is working for Belarus.
Its consequences - especially the reciprocal sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still experiencing sanctions pressure, a long-awaited room for manoeuvre.
According to The Head of the Mises Research Center, former presidential candidate of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus for supplying agricultural products to Russia bypassing sanctions.
At the same time, supply chains are put forward, for which Vladimir Putin at the summit scolded Minsk.
"The initiators of these schemes," Romanchuk said, "are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out schemes of supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
Russian business is in dire need of somehow to restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story - continues the expert - is connected with the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to establish production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with orientation to the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes can now be in high demand."
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the platform for EU-CU negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and in terms of developing economic ties with Europe.
He reminds that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has now offered farmers only 125 million euros of compensation.
The Belarusian president can invite Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for the Europeans.
This can raise Lukashenko's authority in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the format of the EU is disassociated, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart stressed that the initiator of the new format and did Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any indentation to discuss, not from the bay-velvet to make a decision, after the signing of the Association Treaty with the EU, to understand the situation that was developing in Ukraine at that time," - he addressed the cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to appease Moscow, it was rumored to have initially been against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic department diligently emphasizes that Belarus does not pursue selfish goals in organizing the interaction between the EU and the Customs Union on its land, and the ultimate goal of this format is to create a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts, which in other spheres, particularly in the sphere of security, nominates and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation," - said "Ogonku" in the Foreign Ministry of Belarus, the department, where recently scrupulously pick up the words.
In Moscow, may appear zones with paid entry
The government of Moscow is considering the option of introducing zones with paid entry as a method of combating congestion of central roads similar to other major cities of the world, reports M 24.ru referring to Moscow's Deputy Mayor for Transport Maxim Liksutov.
One of the options, which has successfully proven itself, is paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, see all the pros and cons.
It is too early to say that any decisions have been made on this issue," Liksutov said.
The deputy mayor stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and workload to Moscow, is very important for the capital's authorities.
One of the solutions taken from these countries is the already implemented construction of the central ring road, Liksutov added.
The recently begun construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there was sufficient bypass infrastructure, it would not be necessary to have transit traffic in Moscow," the deputy mayor said.
Maxim Liksutov also said that the introduction of paid parking significantly unloaded the capital's streets.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop there.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, participated in the ceremony of laying the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CCAD).
Boredom is sinful
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's film "Sin City 2: The Woman Worth Killing" did not revolution that could be expected of him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), shot with minimal, but symbolic, participation of quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between film, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental chain for modern thinking "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if you understand the thesis of the universe of noir, and under the antithesis - the space of comics).
From now on it should be read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos."
"Sin City 2" is chaotic on both a dramatic and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the characters are familiar from the first "City", although, behold, smashed Marv (Mickey Rourke), remembers, ended his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, just manages to snatch - in the role of a national vigilante - from the air knives and other axes with boa constrictors.
But the old people are literally pushed elbows newcomers, as if broke into the city from some other film, about the meaning and plot of which the audience is asked not to worry.
So, its own story, shamelessly ragged by the authors at the most interesting place, the super-successful player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Her own - at lustful frigid Eve Lord (Eva Green) and for something avenging her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, say, in person is in no way distinguishable from Johnny - especially since the faces, like other parts of the body, the characters are demolished with unforgiving regularity - is not a problem or even half-trouble.
These are not people, we understand that these are the archetypes of noir: a fatal bitch, too confident player, who fell into the "honey trap" sex detective, corrupt ghoul-senator.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and archetype chases, it is no longer a movie, and revere that abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is simply ridiculous.
Besides, even in this cluttered world there is something permanent.
Combat whores from the first "City" still hold a circular defense against the besieged their native slums forces of darkness.
And the ghost of Detective Hartigan no-no, and will look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem with Sin City 2 is another.
Frank Miller was good because as a draftsman talentedly combined comics and noir, and as a director - turned the idea of how to transfer comics to the screen.
Comic and noir are two aggressively opposite "realities."
The phenomenon of comics in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, at the same time when Dashiel Hammett's novels "Bloody Harvest" (1929), "The Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) created the canon noir, then called hard-boiled school - "cool school."
Or pulp fiction.
Comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the sailor Popeye - a spinach eater, giving him heroic power, Superman, Batman and the snooper Dick Tracy to the Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "avengers".
But in any movie based on comics there was something flawed: the hand-drawn characters stubbornly did not want to grow screen flesh, remained pretenders in the surrounding "real" world.
Simply put, they were completely devoid of "existence."
Noir, on the other hand, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional romance - with experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - has lost all credibility.
What Forsythes, what Thibault and Rugon-Maccars, what even Bolkon and Rostov in general conceivable after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into the format of a soap opera, and the criminal - that is, by definition marginal - novel elevated to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett learned what it was like to work as a nurse at the front.
He was a communist.
As, incidentally, were, at least, close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassen, Joseph Lowsey, Edward Dmitrik.
Therefore, the noir, the archetype of which they asked, first, rude and cynical, and secondly - purely social.
This is almost an American version of social realism.
The first "Sin City" was remarkable precisely because it is unnatural, but organically connected the comic with noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic came to life, not shy of its graphic nature, and not pretended to be a "real" film.
The gloom of the corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered murders, and the senator covered the monstrous son of a sadist, was quite worthy of Hammett's pen.
And picturesque details like the severed heads, which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the brilliant James Ellroy, the author of "Black Orchid" and the best - that is, declaratively sickening - representative of the neonar.
"Sin City 2" is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of the radical style of Miller--Rodriguez before the tradition of comics.
Probably, in many respects it was due to 3D technologies.
When you watch the second "City of Sins," you feel like you are in a glass ball, inside which the snow fills the toy cloak.
However, most often it is not snow, and bloody stubble, but by and large what difference?
Well, there is nothing to say about sociality.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere in some places we sometimes, albeit on the side of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world, where you can return a girl who walked on a crooked path or, say, to tell inconsolable parents that her ruiner.
When there is no place for nothing but sin in the city of sin, then sin is no longer a sin, but a norm.
Boring as any norm.
The chaos of "Sin City 2" is just boring.
In fairness, the domestic rental gave this insipid sin a small, but peppercorn.
The captions warn that the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a man with forceps break his fingers, it gives a hell of a sense of humor.
Hammett would have liked it.
France's Socialists must 'shut up and put France in order', says key ally Francois Hollande
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to "demonstrate a warm attitude" towards the attacking Socialist president, whose reshuffle was not approved by the vast majority of French people.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay close to him, " he said, prompting applause.
In a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question France's controversial 35-hour working week, despite conflict-in-content proposals it should loosen rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande pleaded with his Socialist Party comrades to remain "united" with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the Minister of the Socialist Party, put sticks in the wheels, coming to the meeting of dissenting members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "lose faith in the future".
Marine le Pe, leader of the far-right National Front, expressed disdain for the constant internal conflicts among the Socialists, saying she had no idea that The new Welsh government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande - a naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Valls, forced to assemble a new government, when the former did not last and summer.
"And the new one won't last autumn or winter either," Ms. Le Pen told reporters.
She repeated her party's call for the dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident the party could easily win early elections and was ready to govern.
France's ruling party suffered a rout in March's municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in EU elections in May.
A Poll by the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party risks splitting into several rival factions before the end of Mr. Hollande's presidency in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Syans Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new Socialist government fails to fix the economy and record unemployment.
"He doesn't have much time, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"City without drugs" was left without a lawsuit
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed the claim of the regional ministry's management of state property to the "City without Drugs" fund.
The agency intended to collect more than 7 million rubles from the organization as a rent for the building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice.
Today, the Sverdlovsk Region Arbitration Court dismissed the claim of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) to the "City without Drugs" fund (one of the founders - Ekaterinburg Mayor Eugene Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect 7.3 million rubles from the organization as a rent for the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff twice failed to appear in court, which is why it was decided to refuse the consideration.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the directorate of MUGISO could not explain, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer the phone.
Representatives of the foundation could not be reached.
Recall, we are talking about a mansion, which occupied the foundation in the center of the city on Belinsky Street, 19 at no cost since 2011.
This decision was made by ex-governor Alexander Mishari.
In November 2012, the executive directorate of the Sverdlovsk Region State Property Management Ministry filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court to evict the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the department demanded through the court to recognize the contract of gratuitous use of the premises of the mansion-monument.
According to the directorate of IUGISO, the agreement did not include substantial conditions for the lease of the cultural heritage site.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed the claim, then an appeal was filed with the 17th Arbitration Court of Perm, which was granted.
The Fund then filed an appeal against the decision to the same court, which was dismissed, after which the decision was appealed by the foundation to the High Court of Arbitration, but the court sided with the directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was signed, under which the fund again began to pay rent, the head of the city Eugene Roizman said.
The rent was set at 300,000 rubles per month.
The previous administration of the region donated this building to us, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the foundation.
The current administration decided differently," he said.
Tatiana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was offered to leave voluntarily
On July 24, Alexander Kosintsev, a member of the Ekaterinburg City Council, proposed to the mayor of the city, the speaker of the Gordum, Evgeny Roizman, to resign.
The reason was a criminal case against Oleg Kinev, a retired MP who is considered an associate of the mayor, arrested on suspicion of murdering a pensioner.
How Eugene Roizman was found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known that a criminal case had been opened on the "defamation" (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of Ekaterinburg Mayor Eugene Roizman.
This was reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk region, where Anna Filatova, director general of the Legal Center "Protection" filed a statement.
She said Mr. Roizman accused her of her blog posts that she was involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone will be turned into a wallet
In the run-up to September 9, when Apple is due to unveil its new developments, there are more and more leaks in the press about what to expect from the presentation.
Citing sources, U.S. media report that the sixth generation of the iPhone will be equipped with the function of a mobile wallet as a result of a joint project of Apple and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized online resource Re/code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple, among other things, can announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which the new smartphone iPhone 6 will be available mobile wallet function.
The companies themselves declined to comment on the matter.
This feature allows you to make a payment at the checkout store using a smartphone.
Payment identification will be made by the user using their fingerprint using Touch ID.
It is reported that the iPhone will be built for the first time NFC (near field communication), which allows you to make contactless payment with the help of a smartphone and the corresponding reader at the checkout.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC function was first introduced in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that are part of the so-called NFC Forum, an association to promote this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone on Android with NFC function - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced Google Wallet, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay with a smartphone on Android.
However, American experts emphasize that despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, American retailers are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their stores with such systems.
Therefore, now observers hope that Apple's entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their outlets.
French Foreign Ministry: Paris' position on Mistral deliveries to Russia does not change
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said Paris's position on the delivery of Mistral-class helicopter carriers to Russia was unchanged.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (Francois Hollande) in an interview with Le Monde newspaper on 20 August: "Today the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France," RIA Novosti quoted Mr. Nadal as saying.
Thus, the representative of the French Foreign Ministry answered the question whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract

Hong Kong Democratic Movement Activists Disrupt Chinese Representative's Speech Day After Election Decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving a Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday set a procedure by which only two or three candidates will be allowed to run in the 2017 Hong Kong leadership election.
All candidates must first win the support of a majority of the nominating committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get on the ballot paper and has forced pro-democracy activists to once again promise to stop Hong Kong's financial center with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of a document describing China's control over Hong Kong in June, pro-democracy activists held an informal referendum on elections in the Special Administrative Region, and hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business center and staged a sit-in.
Li's briefing is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Bureau of Communications in Hong Kong.
Vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Jang Rongshun, and Feng Wei, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Hong Kong and Macau State Council, were also due to speak at a series of briefings throughout the day.
Student activists said they would gather outside Hong Kong's prime minister's office this afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to Palestinian authority
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of Palestinian-owned land on the West Bank.
According to the BBC, the decision to annex the land of South Bethlith is connected with the desire to repay the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
Israel's defense ministry announced the seizure of territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish an administrative office on the west bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saib Arikat, the world community should hold Israel accountable for "continued settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem".
Putin demands from Kiev to start negotiations on "statehood" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports about his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the divided region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin was not meant to hint that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status inside Ukraine needed to be reconsidered to give the Russian-speaking region the opportunity to defend its rights and interests.
But Putin's call for the Kiev government to begin talks with pro-Russian rebels as equal in line with the apparent strategy he has followed since the bloodshed began five months ago: Help the separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly-proclaimed territory of Novorossiya de facto independence to get closer to Russia, not the West.
In an interview with state-run First Tv Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to retake separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently named the captured territories as Novorossiya, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians begin campaigning for parliamentary elections on October 26 and while government forces are attacking peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, is a "prisoner of illusions," ITAR-TASS reported.
"We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, to meet the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin's words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to assuage fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in jeopardy.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of the Kremlin spokesman to correct Putin's "misinterpretation" of words underscored the Russian leadership's decision to behave towards the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much tougher battle to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million people are not Russians, and polls before the conflict showed widespread support for remaining inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, effectively giving the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would connect Russia's main territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia's main military fleet, as well as commercial maritime facilities and historic seaside resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inaugural speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers after the new elections weigh amendments to the constitution, allowing to give the separated regions more control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels accused of arming and instigating Moscow.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to agree with separatist leaders as equals followed a new rebel offensive last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of the town of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say is the start of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.
This led to large-scale civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and a narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a gathering of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any action; the leaders called for drafting harsher sanctions against Russia, which will be adopted in case of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support the troubled separatists, Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly held in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airborne troops captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten has expressed his disgust at the hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancee Gabi Greco and a list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is in outrage after a series of explicit photos showing a nude Jennifer Lawrence hit the internet in the wake of a massive celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker responsible is said to have about 60 explicit photos of "The Hunger Games" star Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lia Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne-based Greco also allegedly had photos stolen from the iCloud leak.
There are 101 names of celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who made Greco an offer last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It is appalling that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is based in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacking attack was "shameful" and that those targeted "feel they were being invaded."
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two frames of her lying by the pool with her bare breasts.
Palmer's filmmaking includes "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, "Chuck" Strakhovski and "Forbidden Reception" actress Browning did not comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
A spokesperson for Lawrence told TM's: "This is a brazen invasion of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his indignation at the hacker, writing on Twitter: "Posting photos stolen from a mobile phone is really no different than selling stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, you can't tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
A potential way to steal nude photos of celebrities has been discovered
Mass hacking of star accounts may have been caused through a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The potential scenario was described by The Next Web.
On github, a script in the language of Python was published, which allowed you to select passwords for Apple's Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of your iPhone.
To access it, you use the same bundle of Apple ID login and password as you do to access the Apple iCloud cloud from which celebrity photos were stolen.
The script allowed the method of busting to recognize the password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently introduces all sorts of combinations of characters, starting with the most frequently used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that the Find My Phone service has unlimited password options.
If the security system is properly organized, after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and informed the user about the attempted hacking.
Because of the vulnerability, users have not received any reports of trying to pick up a password to their account.
Hackers recognized the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a Twitter user, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago on Saturday and was scripted for password selection.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted a Hackapp user and noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is typical of many services, but noted that there is no evidence that this particular vulnerability was used to access the star account.
It's not me, plz RT
Foreign posts have once again appeared on the Prime Minister's Twitter
Although there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has previously been a wave of malicious activity using this service.
Hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that the cloud security was not compromised in this case, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's twitter account has also been hacked in the past.
If the attackers gained access to iCloud in the above way, the password to the head of the government's account in the microblogging service could be stored there.
The Next Web resource could not be reached for comment by Apple on the Find My Phone vulnerability.
Putin grants Russian citizenship to Ukrainian pentathlon
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to a well-known Ukrainian athlete Anna Buryak.
The relevant decree is published on the Internet portal of legal information.
Earlier this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and applied to the Federation of Modern Pentathlon with a request to give her the opportunity to play for the Russian national team.
In 2013, she won two World Cups, won a silver medal at the European Championships and became the world champion in the mixed relay, which is one of the new programs in the sport.
It holds the leading position in the current season.
According to the rules, in order to compete at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, she will need to obtain special permission from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to chess player Ekaterina Lagno, a native of Lviv who is a two-time European champion (2005, 2008), the World Blitz (2010) and Fast Chess (2014).
As part of the women's team of Ukraine, the athlete won the chess Olympiad in Turin (2006), the Team World Championship in Astana (2013) and the European Team Championship in Warsaw (2013).
SKR has terminated its investigation into the Tu-204 crash in Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (SKR) has dropped a criminal case in connection with the crash of the Plane Tu-204 of Red Wings.
This is reported by the press service of the agency.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and flight engineer.
Forensic examination showed that the cause of the crash was the increased speed of landing, the failure of the crew to comply with standard procedures on landing, as well as the unintentional release of engines to the increased speeds of direct thrust.
The Red Wings Tu-204 aircraft, en route from Prague to Moscow, crashed on December 29, 2012 while landing at Moscow's Vnukovo airport.
The aircraft rolled out of the runway and caught fire.
The aircraft commander, co-pilot and flight engineer died at the scene.
Two flight attendants were taken to hospitals, where they later died from their injuries.
Three other flight attendants, hospitalized with serious injuries, were treated for long periods of time.
In addition, the driver of the car, who was driving on the Kiev highway at the time of the crash, was seriously injured.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
The transport prosecutor's office conducted an inspection at Red Wings after the crash, which revealed numerous violations.
In February 2013, the airline's license was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Emelianenko started training in the detention center
The well-known Russian mixed-style fighter 33-year-old Alexander Emelianenko, who is in pre-trial detention on charges of sexual assault against a housekeeper, fully recovered from his injuries and began training.
This is reported by "Championship."
In May this year, the Investigative Committee of Russia charged Alexander Emelianenko with rape.
The suspect was wanted and detained in Tambov on 9 May after a traffic accident in Tambov, which resulted in a fractured hip.
Emelianenko Jr. was placed under arrest until August 31, and a sentencing was scheduled for September 1.
However, the trial was postponed and the investigation insisted on extending the detention period until 30 September.
If proven guilty, the athlete could face up to six years in prison.

Anger turned out to be the most universal and functional emotion of man
Angry facial expression is biologically universal for humanity, and every organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not accidental, but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists in Australia and the Us have found.
They described their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and can be read briefly about them in a press release from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Angry facial expressions - shifted and lowered eyebrows, outstretched in a thin line of lips, bloated nostrils - are the same in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth to children who have never seen it, notes the study's lead author Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has emerged to effectively dispute during conflict.
The more physical damage one person can inflict on another, the more opportunities he has to dictate his terms, and he brings it to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
Researchers have found evidence of another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and move to hand-wringing, consider themselves entitled to impose conditions unfavorable to them, and prefer forceful methods of conflict resolution peacefully.
Based on the fact that anger is primarily an "emotion of bargaining", the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups, creating an angry expression, should present the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thus force as soon as possible to accept its conditions to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers simulated on a computer the faces where each of the seven elements of the angry face was present or missing, and showed them to informants.
Although the lowered eyebrows or forward chin separately did not make the face angry, the participants of the study recognized the stronger physical participants with such traits.
Human anger, like that of animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one's own power, forcing to accept and obey.
A man inflates his nostrils and presses his lips for the same purpose as a frog that inflates, or a baboon that shows off its fangs.
"Anger is "started" by the refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form, as effectively as possible demonstrating to the opposite side of the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of an angry face is arbitrary, they all express the same thing," said anthropologist John Tooby.
The Ministry of Communications proposed to allocate 250 million rubles to the TV and radio company "Crimea"
The Ministry of Communications proposed to allocate 250 million rubles from the federal budget in 2014 to the autonomous non-profit organization "Crimea" TV and Radio Company.
This is stated in a draft government resolution prepared by the agency, which was read by Lenta.ru.
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be directed "to cover the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the purchase of equipment."
In particular, the allocated money is supposed to convert the hardware-studio unit, video walls, central hardware and video silver.
It is also planned to purchase a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the fiber optic communication line (VOLS) and repair of the energy system.
Subsidies will be provided within the federal budget provided for the Ministry of Communications.
The state broadcaster Crimea was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, the coverage of the television signal of the tv and radio company makes up more than 75 percent of the territory of the peninsula.
In 2011, "Crimea" TV and Radio Company received a license for television broadcasting in digital format.
