Germany is the first in Europe to introduce "indefinite sex" when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to register children born to hermaphrodites instead of male or female to indicate "indefinite."
Parents of the child will have the right to leave the column "sex" for a while in the birth certificate of the unfilled.
Instead of "F" (feal sex) or "M" (feel sex) parents can record "X" (indefinite).
This decision is aimed not to push parents to rush with the operation to "revoke" sex.
According to statistics, one of the 2 thousand newborns in the world is born hermaphrodite.
Hunting because of the verdict to the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
The survivors and relatives of 202 killed as a result of the explosion of the bomb in Bali in 2002 angrily responded to the verdict issued to the last conspirators who appeared before the court, and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years in the race, as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in creating explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
It can be released for 15 years if it receives parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murders as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, during which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens were wounded.
He was also found guilty of a number of other charges related to terrorism, including in a wave of explosions of churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a lifetime, although they could insist that a man called a bomber for his reputation as a master in the manufacture of explosive devices must be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of the mother of Perth Jun Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.
As soon as she restrained her tears, she said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the shooting team," said Ms. Cortin AAP.
I must live every day, knowing that I will no longer have my grandchildren, and I will not see my daughters.
The "Sari" Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was put into operation, laid in the parked outside the van, immediately after 11 pm October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in the bar "Peddi" where the suicide bomber exploded a backpack, stuffed with explosives, only 20 seconds earlier.
After this attack, he fell into whom and the Tsemiral three times, being connected to the life support system for a month.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek must share the fate of the other three members of the terrorist cell - Jemaa Islam, responsible for the bloody massacre, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
To save his life, well, there is no reason to save his life.
Get 20 years after killing 202 people and injured hundreds - this is not so much.
Patek is the last of the participants of the terrorist attack in Bali, who presented himself before the court.
He had been hiding for almost ten years, but was finally detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American troops killed the former leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent showed that these intelligence testified: Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to restore ties between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up," said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he did not regret the number of grief he had caused to other people.
The sentence was issued on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
"This year there will be a lot of tears," says Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
Medvedev expects SSJ-100 to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after securing in the markets of Latin America and Asia, the Superjet 100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe.
"We expect that in total we will receive such agreements on more than 170 copies of this type of aircraft," - quotes "Interfax" the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Eiro.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with the French colleagues, since it is a joint project.
We have discussed today some financial issues related to insurance, but we hope that after this plane is strengthened in Latin America and Asia-Pacific, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that he will ever be delivered to France," said the Russian Prime Minister.
SSJ-100 is a plane built by Civil Aircraft of Sukhoi in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Liner is designed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
Goalkeeper of "Chicago" Nikolai Khabibulin stressed: he understands that he should play better.
According to 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two matches of "Yastrebov" Habibulin first missed six goals from "Tampa Bay," and then four - from "Ottawa," and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I failed, - c. CSNChicago quotes Khabibulin's words.
- I need to find confidence in training, probably it is worth approaching them as games, and try to achieve a better result.
You have to explore your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been.
There are several small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel quite decent.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need a little to relax.
Goalkeepers - I don't think I'm the only one - always trying to do the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not delighted.
No matter what happens before my gate.
I am still working on myself to avoid so much puck.
It is great that my teammates support, but in principle everything is simple: I have to play better.
Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to spend them much better.
But what happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'll just try to win back the next match better.
Dnepropetrovsk power engineers began a unique program to rescue... storks
In olden times, to be attached to the courtyard of the storks, the villagers on a high pillar set a wheel from a cart, and the heavy nest was held well on it.
Such special supports have long been no longer put, so the arists have chosen the pillars of power lines - interwoven branches are based on wires, so that the astiny house is reliable.
Grandma Anya, near the house of which in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district for twenty years has been living an aistina family, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The evictioners put new twigs on top, and the lower layer is already settled between the wires, is about to collapse.
Of course, it is a pity for the family of storks, who every year nested at the Metochor, took out and fed three or four chicks during the summer, but without light do not want to stay.
As soon as the birds flew into the warm regions, Anya's grandmother called Tsarichansky Distribution Zone, which belongs to the support.
And I did not even expect that they would react so quickly.
When our specialists came to Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest is still kept, - said the technical director of DTEK "Dneprooblenergo" Sergey Berezovsky.
On the wires, which turned out, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150 - 200 kilograms, corrosion began.
At any time, the birds could die from the electric discharge.
And the locals risked to remain without light due to damage to the wires.
Therefore, linear installers began the operation to rescue the nest, and not for the first time in our practice.
Scientists-ornithologists from the Dnipropetrovsk National University, who developed a scheme of nest transfer.
They also conducted trainings for employees of district networks.
Famous Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised power engineers at all stages of reconstruction of nests.
First, they calculated that in the area in the emergency condition there are more than 50 aisy "apartments."
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were welded, resembling a funnel.
The base was spit with willow branches, and then moved there the old nest.
According to the connoisseurs, it is enough to lay the old branches as a basis, so that the birds recognize the nest and return to it.
Already then the aists themselves will build their home.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka of Novomoskovsk district.
Next to the electric pole was put a new reinforced concrete pillar and placed on it a platform with an old, already living nest.
The whole operation cost power engineers nine thousand hryvnia.
And the other day the same house was held in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district on the Metoch and grandmother Ani.
Here the platform was fixed in the same place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists believe that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has undergone major repairs.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four more nests in Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of Dnepropetrovsk region.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others are ruthlessly killed.
Recently, the entire region flew through the sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolic District, on the opening day of hunting for pheasants, poachers for entertainment shot a swan family, living in a local pond.
Noble birds were not afraid of people at all - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers heard the guns and ran to the pond, four beauties-swans were already lying on the water.
Now employees of the Apostolic district police department find out who shot at the birds listed in the Red Book.

The airport management allowed the flight of the board, having received money for fuel.
According to the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other data, it will go to the United States.
As reported, the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Trans-Baikal Territory because of the fog.
Due to unpaid accounts it was not issued from the airport of Chita.
On board the aircraft are 30 people, including the crew, two nights they spent on the territory of the airport, ITAR-TASS reports.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, according to the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, people on board the aircraft have no right to go outside the airport of Chita, they can pass border control only at two airports of Russia - in Kubinka and in Ulan-Ude.

Vitaly Mutko: Waters?
I think we returned 15 years ago.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the riots at the stands during the match of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - "Spartak."
I am a supporter of all this in charge of the organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, RFS.
But we see that they have taken a dr-dig position.
They expect someone to come from the outside and restore order.
This is a very good position, but not quite correct.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards, and not let the matter on its own.
We have now developed a special government decree on the rules of conduct at stadiums.
Once it is accepted, we will deal closely with this problem.
But I am sure to invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read an interview with Leonid Fedun.
The state, they say, give the law quickly.
It seems that these fans of "Bavaria" came to Yaroslavl and all this arranged.
And we are third-party observers.
In general, it's awful to see a tribune watered from Brandspou.
And it is in the country that is preparing for the World Cup.
"I have the feeling that we returned 10-15 years ago," said Mutko.
Lawyer with cocaine addiction, who warned the head of the criminal group about the police investigation, is imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditt transmitted information to criminal authority Nile Scarborough
The defense lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be revealed
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Royal Court of Liverpool.
The prestige lawyer, who told the drug baron about a major police investigation, because he was afraid to expose his secret drug addiction, was imprisoned for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Ditt handed over to criminal authority Nile Scarborough secret information about the investigation of his drug trafficking activities after being threatened because of his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, who received the nickname of Bash and called among the criminals a twisted lawyer, was arrested at home in 2011 after a police surveillance operation for Scarborough, which he had previously represented at a court related to drugs.
Officers noticed that the 32-year-old Scarborough left three bags with cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn county Lancashire, while he was at the dinner of the Bar Association with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Dietta was "regularly using a class A drug after the tests showed the traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police supervision at this time as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lankashire, Cambria, Mersisayd, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and another 32 people were later imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine during a series of raids worth 1.5 million and more than 200 thousand in cash.
42-year-old Ditt transmitted information to criminals because of fear that his cocaine addiction will be revealed.
Today, in the Royal Court of Liverpool, Dett, who works at Forbes Solicitors, a law firm in Blackburn, was covered with shame after his guilt was found in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice on the results of a three-week trial in the Liverpool Court of the Crown.
He confessed the storage of cocaine at one of the previous trials.
The exposing of the lawyer occurred after the police investigating Scarborough's activities found out that he had regularly talked to Ditt over the phone starting from February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found how he went to the house of Dett in Blackburn and placed drugs 60 percent cleanliness in a black golf glove under the legal trash boxes.
Shortly after the transfer Scarborough was repeatedly convened with Ditt, who was at dinner at the football stadium Iwood Park team "Blackburn Rovers."
The lawyer returned home for drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court found out that Ditt used cocaine regularly, after the tests found traces of class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Dett was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, said he had talked to the suspected dealer, because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was the same as the Filt;
During his detention, Ditt took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, he also had a sample of hair.
At the interrogation at the police he said that along with the workplace, he had a home office and clients came to him for legal affairs.
However, it became known to the court that after important arrests he called the largest participants of drug trafficking, a number of whom he had previously represented in court to tell that they are known to detectives.
In an indictment, Anne White said: "If anyone knows that it is not necessary to violate the law, it is a lawyer in criminal cases.
Mr. Ditt is accused of abuse of his position of a lawyer in criminal cases, since he has entered into a too close relationship with certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who has drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly turn out to be legitimate because he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the usual relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He prevented the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditt did not honor his profession, but disgraceed her.
He approached certain customers, in particular Scarborough, and allowed him to doubt his uninterestedness.
Ditt did not admit the guilt and said: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I would like to convey the information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited for 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.
But after the meeting, senior officer Lee Holsted from Lancashire police said: "H-N. Ditt turned from a criminal lawyer in criminal cases, as soon as he began to acquire drugs from representatives of organized crime.
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of the main participants of criminal groups, who instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire society trust and confidence.
Mr. Ditt betrayed this trust and tried to hide himself in his profession.
The investigation into Mr. Ditt's case was conducted by Lancashire's subdivision on a particularly dangerous organized crime, which has already been sentenced to him in three cases of cocaine storage, and now also to prevent the implementation of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is out of reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after confessing his guilt in conspiracy with the purpose of delivering heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people who participated in the machination were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditt organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers, in which he says that the work of his dream is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the ideal companion for him at dinner - Mohammed Ali, and the motivation in the work is inequality.
Manufacturers of jet jets are hostile to the width of the seat when big orders are at stake
Between the leading aircraft manufacturers, there was a fierce dispute over the width of the tourist class seats on distant flights, setting the tone for fierce confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The dispute is turning around the width of the seats provided on long-haul flights to economy class passengers, whose interests are not always in the focus of the airlines, while the volume of the space allocated for them plays a key role in the statements about the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide for a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class salons, but its main American competitor Boeing says that it must be decided by the airline.
The dispute is at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in sales of increasingly large versions of their two-motor long-haul aircraft, and at the event on November 17-21 potentially record orders are expected.
The layout of the rear part of the aircraft is especially whether 9 or 10 people are in a row - occupies a central place in statements about the economic efficiency of new projects of the Amini-airbus.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on seats in the economic class of more than 17 inches in width, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in economy class on 18 inches seats, located 9 in a row.
Aircraft building giants often exchange blows on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus appeals directly to the public before the air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated how the beginning of a new advertising war could be, showing financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant pressed to each other, called "Write agree to it?
"Boeing offers long-haul flights on the seats more narrow than the regional turbo-wine aircraft," said the sales manager of Airbus John Lihi.
With the change in the diet, people gain weight, but the plane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 broad-body set the standards of modern long journeys, and the age of the century, the weight of the average American man aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the US Department of Health.
The girth of the average American man of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to statistics of the US health service.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of seats of the 1950s, when the average waist girth of those who recently called the "reactive public," was already.
Airbus says that ordered a study indicating that an additional inch in the width of the seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests the figures of Airbus in terms of seats and says that manufacturers should not interfere with the decisions on how airlines find a balance between tariffs and amenities.
According to her, the studies show that the convenience of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
"Everything is actually reduced to providing airlines with choice and the opportunity to do what they believe should do to achieve success," said the Boeing specialist in the salons of Kent Cravere.
They do not want us to decide for them, what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
This dispute is followed by a race for aircraft orders, estimated at least $700 billion at price in the coming decades - enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
Reuters reported for the first time in July that the seat location is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest jet aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20% increase in profitability in one place in their last two-motor long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared characteristics of Boeing are partially based on the comparison of 10-seat 777X rows with the original 9-seater layout of the 777 design line.
Winning in the specific cost decreases when compared to the 10-seat layout currently used.
"The reason Boeing does this is to squeeze more seats and make your plane more competitive compared to our developments," said Kevin Keniston, Head of the Comfort Department of Airbus passengers in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that salons with full 10-seat rows for existing 777-x indicate that many passengers prefer a dense seating, which can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
"Since the width of eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view the proposal of Airbus is caused by the threat from the 777th model," said Mary Kirby, interior specialist, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply chairs, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Traveling around the world, the sellers of jet aircraft even carry roulette to check the competing plans.
Disposal of comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense layout of the cabin for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10-seat rows, but says it has not sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional modifications of salons, offering wider places at the passage on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of major modern aircraft, according to experts, its call to the new industry standard is unlikely to fly up, but can divert attention from the wave of sales of the model 777X.
Oleynikov: a third of rural settlements in Moscow region completely subsidies
Vice Governor of Moscow region Yuri Oleynikov said that almost a third of rural settlements of the Moscow region are completely subsidized
Total subsidies from the budget of the region receive 187 settlements out of 288.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget.
The specific weight of subsidies in the budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 percent subsidies.
As part of the budgetary security, about 25 billion rubles are sent from the regional budget," Oleinikov said.
The vice-governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mytishch, Odintsovo and Pushkino - budget revenues amount to more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The revenues of rural settlements in many districts are less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough."
The expenses for the maintenance of the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of the Moscow region is more than 70%, "at the same time there is a decrease in the quality of services," Oleinikov said.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of municipalities of the Moscow region until the end of November to consider which settlements need to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or changes in the system of administrative administration.
These proposals will be worked out by the end of January.
Prior to that, the Governor of the Moscow Region said that within the framework of the administrative reform in the Moscow region it is planned to reduce the number of subsidies of rural settlements.
Also in Mozhaysky, Kashirsky, Solnechnogorsk, Kolomna districts, Lyubertsy and Kotelniki there is a request for the enlargement of municipalities.
Discussion of this issue in cities and districts of the region will begin in November.
Chairman of the Moscow City Duma Igor Bryntsalov also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of Moscow region are planning to unite within the upcoming administration.
This is due to the fact that less than a third of 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region have a "acceptable" financial base, and 100 - subsidies.
The worry about security in Mozambique is escalating due to the conflict of influential people
Under the statue of Samora Masha, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chanting slogans about the world at one of the rare demonstrations here.
We want the return of the world; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sussa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed the business suit to a T-shirt decorated with the inscription "We demand safety" in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital Square of Independence.
Within two weeks there were almost daily reports of clashes between government troops and Renamo - this is one of the most violent clashes since the ceasefire was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, which was first supported by the white authorities of Rhodesia, and then by the government of South Africa apartheid as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to fall again to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have forced foreign investors and local residents to worry.
The rates are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest can attract more than $50 billion as investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling party of Frelimo, leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo party has accused each other of the tensions created.
The Renamo Party claims that the government has become the infecter of the last clashes, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional stronghold of Renamo, October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then escalated when the government troops attacked the Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakam, the leader of the group, Fernando Mazang, representative of Renamo, told Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armendu Gebuza tried to dispel fears about instability.
Hebuz told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakam felt like an unsucator who wanted to use all that remained of his strength to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government.
Both Frélimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears grew after the announcement that Mazang announced the refusal of Renamo to the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant non-compliance with the agreement by the Frelimo party.
Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with all seriousness," said Mazang.
Previous negotiations between parties did little to weaken the tensions, which strengthened a series of clashes this year.
"They are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakam), who encountered the foreheads, "said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer of the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt to weakened the movement to make concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party is the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazang says that Mr. Gebuza, who should quit his post next year, when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to leave the post of president," said Mazang.
It is unclear what opportunities Renamo possesses, but it has already carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on the key motorway leading from north to south.
Most of the skirmishes took place in the province of Sophala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beira - a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railways for about a week after Renamo threatened with an attack on the railroad.
Mazang was evasive when he was asked whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo Party wanted to warn the international community that the Mozambique was not going well, "Masanga said.
Instability has increased dissatisfaction with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and frequent recently kidnapping of people, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, who should find a solution to these problems," he says.
Omar Sultuan, a participant in the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
"Nothing cares either Renamo or Fréllimo, they just want to resume the world, they want free access to the roads," he said.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia so far will remain in force
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite the measures in the United States to soften the rules relating to these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided that they remain in the Flight Regime.
Passengers can already do it during the main part of the flight, but many are irritated that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers consider this decision, which required American airlines to carry out a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but pointed out that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
In the Civil Aviation Safety Department, they also noted that they are considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of the flight are still in Australia.
The Civil Aviation Flight Safety Authority currently has no special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft, "It said.
This issue is regulated by the rules that require air carriers to ensure safety at any time, and from passengers to comply with the safety rules, which they are informed by the crew members.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the expansion of use on board its entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not against the changes, but stated that it will follow the instructions of the regulator.
"We would welcome consideration by the Civil Aviation Flight Safety Authority on the issue of permitting the use of electronic devices, because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now when it (on-board wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft," said the spokesman.
Qantas said she would adhere to the current rules.
Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and in the near future we do not plan to change it," she said.
The decision of the FAU applies to American airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the decision of the FAU and the reasons that caused it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the resolution will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interfering from mobile devices, as well as to review manuals, training materials, manual rules and instructions for passengers.
"After the airline will check and confirm the interference resistance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones, at any height, said FAU.
In rare cases, poor visibility, the crew will give instructions to passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group's recommendation, heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
Obama Refuses to Give His Words on Health
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama yesterday went to the spot about his frequently repeated, unambiguous promise that if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people receive notifications about the termination of services from their providers, the Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for misleading the American society.
Yesterday, Obama somewhat corrected his original public promise.
"Momer people who have medical insurance, who work, can save it," he said in his speech in Boston.
Speaking about what he called revitalize in the news about the termination of the provision of services, Obama called on the Americans to look for other options on the market.
Most people will be able to get the best, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
"You will receive more favorable conditions," he said.
The administration said that no one should be surprised that 5 % of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans, because their coverage does not meet the new standards necessary in accordance with the law on available medical care.
"Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Sibelius in a speech to the Committee on Energy and Trade of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who supervises the implementation of the law on available medical care, said that the launch of the online sales platform is going badly " since October.
"I am upset and angry as all," she said.
I really want to return your trust."
The irritated Sibelius dropped this phrase, which was caught by the online microphone sitting behind her assistant at yesterday's hearings in the ward after heated debates with a member of the House of Representatives Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she was obliged to join Obama's health program.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the Office of the available medical care law voluntarily refused the government-sponsored insurance to acquire the plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.

Blizzard has released a 19-year-old platformer for free
Blizzard Studio has released for free on PC its platformer in 1994 Blackethorn.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game became available in Battle.net under the classic Blizzard games section.
However, some gamers note that currently only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it.
For Russian users, the game is not yet available.
As the media transmit, the version Blizzard has now released on PC, does not differ from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released in the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and luminous kingdoms.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright king of Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending to Earth.
Twenty years later he returned to Tuul to fight with the minions of Sarlaka and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after its renaming into Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon &amp; Synapse.
The publisher of Blackthorne was the company Interplay.
Coleson resorted to a breach of the phone to check the confidential message
Former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson allegedly used the burglary of the phone, surveillance and confrontation when trying to confirm false information about the novel by Charles Clark, who at that time was Minister of the Interior.
The acculator, royal lawyer Andrew Edis, told the court of Old-Bayley that in May 2005 the newspaper News of the World received inaccurate news that Clark meets his "enriched special advisor Hannah Polby."
The newspaper instructed Glenn Mulkeir to hack Polby's voice mail and waited at home to interview, but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages, and heard the court.
"The charge believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the person who will stand near someone's house, hoping to catch someone by surprise, he is a man who loves to offer history to people to see what they will say," said Mr. Edis.
He said that the News of the World newspaper used three ways to investigate stories: hacking phones, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously he knows about the second, about surveillance, he just needs.
What about the first?
Does he know about breaking phones?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
Rumors about the novel Clark for the first time attracted the attention of the editorial office of News of the World, when the source, sexually interested in Mr. Polby, said: "Don't waste time, she and Charles."
The cassette with voice messages received from her phone at least three times was withdrawn from Mulkeir's house in August 2006.
The investigators also found recordings on the computer of a private detective in which Miss Polby and her sister were figured as "Projects."
During the period when she was under surveillance, her grandmother and grandfather, Mr. Polby, received anonymous calls with requests to provide information about her, said Mr. Ediz.
At this time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbek and former reporter James Weserap controlled the surveillance of the movements of Mr. Polby.
By putting her a voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and which I would like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edis said that Coulson's participation in this story took place according to the same scenario as with other influential people, such as former Interior Minister David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had joined the confrontation with Mr. Blanket about the novel with a married woman while he met with Rebecca Brooks, who was married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiracy with other people to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkeir, Turlbek and Wezerap confessed the breach of phones.
There is no "Brother Circle" group in the Interior Ministry bases, which Leps was classified in the U.S.
The databases of the Russian security and law enforcement agencies of the "Brother Circle" group, to which Washington ranked the singer Grigory Leps, does not count.
As Interfax was noted in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after the media reported that the US Department of Finance Grigory Leps made control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Bratsky Circle," all databases were checked, but such a group was not found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called "Russian mafia," which allegedly operates abroad, according to the security agencies.
"Even in the name itself - "Brother's circle," there is a certain element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret couch.
"All this is very similar to a PR campaign," the agency's interlocutor said.
On October 31, the US Department of Finance announced that on its control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate Arthur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov.
The persons listed in this list are suspected of being connected with the liaments of Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and are on the sanctions lists of the United States since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps "serves a courier to deliver money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev."
The producer center of Grigory Leps refused to comment on the U.S. accusations against the singer, calling them "a delirium."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama attributed the "Brother Circle" syndicate to the number of "significant transnational organized organized criminal groups" and instructed the Ministry of Finance to "determine and rebue and rebusult their global criminal operations."
The entry of a person in the blacklists of the U.S. Minfin entails blocking his assets in the U.S. and the ban on business contacts with him of persons living in the United States.
Scientists have shed light on how the movements of the dog's tail are connected with her mood.
Early studies have shown that satisfied dogs are forks tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while alarmed dogs wave their tail predominantly in the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can notice these subtle differences in the tail of the veer and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist from the University of Trent, says: "It is well known that people have left and right sides of the brain differently involved in the formation of pathogens that cause positive or negative emotions.
Here we tried to look at it in other species.
He added that just like a person, dogs have the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotion.
To learn more about how dogs react to versatile tails of other dogs, researchers watched animals when they watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
Probably soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go one way, and sometimes to another
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed dogs videos with dogs - either naturalistic versions, or silhouette to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct the tail more to the left or to the right.
When the animals saw that otherwise the dog's expressing dog moved the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog's wagging tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was mostly inclined to the left (again from the point of view of the dog's wagging tail), their heartbeat was increasing and they looked alarmed.
Professor Valortigara said he did not think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other with the help of these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs learned from their experience, what movements they should worry about, and what movements they should not.
He remarks: "If there are several meetings with other dogs and often the wagging of their tail in one direction is connected with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of the emotions of their animal.
Dog Behavior John Bradshaw, an invited researcher at the University of Bristol University veterinary school, said that this was not the first study to check whether the left and right-handed dogs were important.
Last year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left, if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right, if they look at a satisfied dog.
And in another scientific work of the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: " Dogs more often approached the dog-robot, when the wagging of her tail was sent to the left, and not to the right, instead of becoming alarmed, - the opposite behavior in relation to the Italian study.
He said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or dog robots as dogs.
It would be useful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
"Wait with different mammals, there is enough evidence that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are yet to be refined, and the dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be registered, we will probably soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed to one side, and sometimes to another.
Is the elite of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the obligation to gather business representatives and determine what changes the creators of the well-being and jobs of the UK want to see in relations with the EU.
To this end, we have ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business tops, asking them to express their thoughts about the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov has interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of business in the UK in size, sectors and regions.
The conclusions of the survey will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently looking for opportunities for exports outside Europe, paying special attention to the countries that carry out modernization and grow, while the EU countries are in stale.
They want the government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spending time on a long and difficult process of reforming confusing EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to production laws, most business leaders believed that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the common market, and business representatives stated that the costs of regulation from Brussels are now outhung the benefits of being in the European trade zone, - even 40% of the large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European companies, traditionally the most pro-European ones, agreed with this.
The latest and most indicative of our survey of business leaders has revealed that the obvious majority wants the UK to pursue a course to change the contract and relations with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which was observed among the enterprises of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that the business insists on an important change that will return the authority back to the UK.
The rates are high - the achievement of changes in the contract and more favorable conditions for the UK will provide a 16 percent shift in voting for staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British business supports his plan to revise the terms of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business expects that the revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back towards the UK.
The best conditions for British business are possible and become increasingly necessary as the euro zone enters into the path of a closer economic and financial association.
The priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and, as the results of our survey show, for business this means increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in the regulatory activities of Brussels.
The politician in Turkey declared a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began the construction of a dividing wall near the city of Nusaibin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdian party of PMD strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaibin, Aishe Gekhan on the Syrian border, has declared a hunger strike, protesting against the construction of a dividing wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA Novosti reported in the press service of the Party of Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.
The police repeatedly dispersed protest demonstrations.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mummer Guler first denied the fact of construction, then said that the wall is built to ensure the security of the borders.
"Mr Nusaibin Aishe Gekhan, a member of the PMD, has declared a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," the party press service said.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds crossed this border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhumane situation with which the Kurds will never agree," Aisha Gekhan quotes party representatives.
According to the press service, on November 7 in Nusaibin it is planned to hold a rally against the construction of a dividing wall.
This morning in Sarata district, the car driver "Peugeot" drove to the counter lane on 115 km of the route Odessa-Reni, and faced a bus in which there were six people.
It is reported by the press service of the management of DSNS in the Odessa region.
As a result of the incident 31-year-old car driver "Peugeot" died.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver, who squeezed his leg, was injured.
Doctors provided the woman with first aid on the spot, she refused to hospitalize.
Also, ambulance staff examined all other passengers.
Rescuers with the help of the crane lifted the bus and liberated the driver of the bus, whose leg was clamped at the door of the bus.
In Siberia, you should not be a vegan: greenhouse tomatoes will not replace the soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, RIA Novosti correspondent found out.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they do not endure the winter without loss of health, and no greenhouse tomatoes compensate them, according to the surveyed on the eve of the vegan Day Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors.
Dice oil with litres
Strictly vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, diet seekers believe that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict standards in nutrition, at least, is not useful for health.
The complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for plant.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the diet," - is sure dietitian Marina Bogay.
It cites the example of fish containing irreplaceable fatty acid omega-3.
The richest vegetable oil is the slible.
"In order to consume it in the amounts necessary for a person, you need to drink litres!" - says the nutritionist.
Doctors believe that the people of Siberia should pay special attention to the diet in winter.
This season, vegetarianism is especially questioned.
In the conditions of our realities, there are high requirements for food.
In order not to freeze, you need increased calorie.
"If a person limits himself on animal products, respectively, he does not get this calorie," - says the specialist.
Doctor-dietologist Olga Pozniak agrees with this.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not an option.
It is better for a person to eat mainly foods that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
Genetic code is configured to better assimilate and digestion of these products.
And in winter, people do not want to gnaw cucumber, and hot soup or something more, "- explains his position doctor.
According to her, from the fact that there can eat vegans, really useful various cereals, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples, remaining in the winter, frozen berries.
But this, unambiguously, is not enough for a full-fledged nutrition.
According to the doctor-gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians in organisms have sufficient vitamins only from mid-August to mid-September.
Full transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and in May the snow lies, is inexpedient.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, first of all, fat," the doctor states.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
And by adhering to vegetarianism, we give them inferior.
Pregnants also need increased protein content, vitamins and trace elements in the menu.
"Vaganki get them short," - is sure God.
Arifulin says that an adult is free to choose anything, "play in the toys that he wants."
He has an already formed body, skeleton, organs.
And children still have to eat fully.
If parents deprive him of some trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what it will be, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones tomorrow will not recover," she says.
All medical specialists surveyed agree on the low quality of grown in winter in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
The fact that we are brought and grown in greenhouses, contains less trace elements necessary for us than ( grown) in the open ground.
"Quality of products is not that," says God.
Arifulin also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to collect a greater harvest causes damage to quality.
"Apples do not become brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly yellow and splash, tomatoes tasteless and non-aromatous," - cites the examples of the physician, adding that they are likely to be packed with excessive amount of fertilizers.
And become suppliers not vitamins, but fiber.
Vera Petruk, the supervisor of the Siberian Institute of Agricultural Problems, the candidate of agricultural sciences, disagrees with this.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all the norms and requirements in greenhouses, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If they try to drive out more from a square meter, then, of course, they will water more often, and overfeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened, "- she explains, adding that the issue of quality, first of all, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.
Russia outside the fight for the pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve transport problems of major cities were observed in most megacities of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was either about their reconstruction and expansion of highways, or attempts to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of cars and their use time.
The example of Singapore is widely known, where the strict quota of growth of the number of private cars is introduced, and the right to purchase them is bought at auctions.
Its price can double or three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, introduced a fee for entry to the city center.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introduce so-called green areas, where only cars with a certain ecoclass, using high-quality fuel (including biofuel or electric vehicles) are allowed to enter.
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a "five-year plan of clean air" worth about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As the director of the Department for Transport Pollution Control of the Municipal Environmental Protection Office of Beijing Li Kunchen, the main goal of the five-year plan is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, the growth of the number of private cars to the level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), as well as an increase of no more than 5% of the use of fuel per vehicle.
According to the agency, now vehicles in Beijing are responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program - restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, urban measures of the "green five-year" include an accelerated transition to the European standards of fuel, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and marking cars and fuel, restricting the entry of cars to the central part of the city, a ban on the use of outdated vehicles (except for the creation of incentive financial programs for the replacement of old cars on hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric vehicles (including public and official transport).
Among the automotive innovations of Beijing also includes a ban for all private cars on movement within the fifth transport ring (only in the capital of China there are six) one day per week (corresponding information is contained in the vehicle license plate), as well as the issuance of registration signs for cars based on the lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number of 2010).
According to the current state program "Environmental protection for 2012-2020," the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011 "movable sources" accounted for 41% of all emissions of polluting substances into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In Russia, so far, they are just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute of Transport and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for automobile travel are obviously unpopular, they can be accepted by society only if they are full of universality.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of weakly sensitive to any regulatory impacts - service and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is not less than 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of the car park in Moscow).
Recently, urbanists from the center of ECOM in St. Petersburg prepared a study, which analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential development, road surface area and the number of vehicles.
The main conclusions of researchers: the city center is provided with roads twice as much as required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking, but storage cars, not to expand, but to reduce the roadway (so that the streets become more friendly for pedestrians), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the territory of the protected area of the historical center (the total territory of about 3212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
The increase in fuel will lead to the tax maneuver, which provides for an increase in the mineral extraction tax on oil simultaneously with the reduction of export duties and increase in excise taxes.
According to experts, these measures can bring additional 619.3 billion rubles to the budget.
Drive through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Brwelle provides free medical assistance in the countryside in Cameroon
Brwelle and his team spend almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients
In this West-African country doctors are not so many - only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Brwelle is one of the 10 main characters of CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to become the Hero of the Year CNN.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father return to life and retreat into an unconscious state, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamph Bwelle was injured in a car crash in 1981 near Jaunda, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only a broken hand, but the resulting infection spread to the brain and caused the hematum, which reminded itself for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Brwelle.
If we had the money, we would have taken it out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwell accompanied his father for years in crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
"It's not easy," said Bwell.
You can leave the house at 5 am, run to the hospital to be the first, but you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Bwell's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, in Cameroon only one doctor for 5,000 people.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for 413 people.
And even if the Cameroons could go to the doctor, many of them would not be able to afford.
Two out of five people in this country live beyond poverty, and almost three-quarters of healthcare expenses in it are private.
The only problem is poverty," said Bwell.
And because of poverty they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bwell was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Brwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon in the Central Hospital of Jaunda.
He also founded a non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people are poured into vans, tied to the roofs of medical supplies and travel through rough terrain to visit the village in need of help.
Not always they are accompanied by luck.
Many times they had to push cars through the rivers and dirt.
But when they come, they are met as real heroes: it is a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms that the locals can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is really a holiday occasion, and Bwell with its wide smile and boundless energy is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the brigade begins to take hundreds of patients.
"We welcome 500 people on each trip," said Bwell.
They come from all over the county within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics weekend provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment from malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - documents necessary for a school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually carried out in the school building, municipality or house; after the procedure, patients get into the postoperative zone to make room for the next person.
Using a generator for the lighting of operating and sanitary treatment of equipment, Bwelle and its volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
This is a low pace, but the purposefulness of the brigade usually helps to support the village musicians.
"They're beating the drums all night, so that we're awake and continue to work," said Bwell.
On Sunday, the brigade members go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their help can be of great importance for those to whom they help.
One person explained that the free surgery he received for hernia treatment will allow him to work again.
"This will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these clinical receptions on the weekend and work in the hospital, the surgeon Bwell also works at nights in private medical clinics around Jaunde.
It is this second work, he said, that provides 60 % of funding of its non-profit organization; the rest of the funds are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, second-year medical student at the University of Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bwell group.
He is always in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization, so that you can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in fulfilling his tasks, it is an opportunity of practice that they would never have received at home.
"We were able to assist in operations where we helped to remove blood stains or keep the tools for Dr. Bwell, said O'Malley.
As a second-year student, you would never get such an opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But upon arrival in Jaund their food, transport and training pays Bwell.
"He's a hero, no doubt, " said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon indefinitely.
For Bwell, almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
To help live a happy life to others, to fulfill the promise given to your father is what brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," said Bwell.
And I think of my father.
Hopefully he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can help.
For the "Russian mafia" in the United States finally consolidated a new name - "Brother Circle"
This week, the black list of "Russian mafia" in America was added to new names and four companies.
The U.S. Department of Finance introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli.
One of the Russians was the famous singer Grigory Leps, who is suspected of transporting money for members of the group.
In total, there are 22 people involved in the "Brother Circle" and six affiliated organizations in the US blacklist.
Nevertheless, many experts express doubts that such an organization really exists.
"The statement about the "Brother's most like an attempt to unite disparate criminal groups," - said an expert on organized crime and professor of the University of New York Mark Galeotti.
In his opinion, the "Brother Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia."
"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," Galeotti quotes the American Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Galeotti agrees with the professor of George Mason University.
"If they act together, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization," the Center for the Investigation of Corruption and Organized Crime cites.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "Brother Circle" unites more close Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Santa Hasan.
The criminal authority was killed in January this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zahari Kalashov, who added the list in 2012, were closely connected with Ded Hasan, and another member of the list, Temur Mirzoev, was Ded Hasana nephew.
Nevertheless, Mr. Galeotti notes that some individuals have nothing to do with Usoyan.
In his opinion, they were united by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal over the inclusion of Grigory Leps, the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the "Brother's circle," attracted the Kremlin's attention.
Naturally, we expect that we will receive more detailed information from our American partners, in connection with which such a decision was made, why it was included in such lists, - said the press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
Just like the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
Tony Blair said that he would take advantage of the chance to return as the British Prime Minister, but admits that the return is unlikely.
On the eve of the evening, in an interview dedicated to the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years as a leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments by foreign affairs and his role as an ambassador in the Fourth Middle East Peacekeepers.
Answering the question whether he would have returned to the post of prime minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely to happen, so ...
The head coach of "Milan" Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret about the draw in the match of the 10th round of the championship of Italy with "Lazio."
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start are due to a series of injuries to the leading players.
I am very sorry that we did not manage to win, - Tmw quotes Allegra.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half we did not allow "Lazio."
In the second Romans added, but in general I can not say that we have lost concentration.
It was necessary to win.
Last season we completed the task of getting into the Champions League.
Now we are lagging behind the schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
These are very good players, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Take a look at Ka'a, who held the meeting at a high level.
British police handing Assange a notice of extradition
The British police today handed a notice of the issuance of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who fled the embassy of Ecuador in London and asked for asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they said that they handed 40-year-old Australian official demand to surrender with a request to come to the police station, adding that in case of non-fulfillment of this requirement, he will be subject to arrest.
Assange threatens to extradite Sweden on charges of sexual crimes after he has exhausted his capacity in accordance with the British law, when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand it over to the United States, on June 19 he fled the Ecuadorian embassy in London, asking for political asylum from this South American country.
Scotland Yard handed a 40-year-old man an official demand to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice, as the press secretary said.
He still violates the conditions of release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the presentation of the notification to the police.
The Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to file possible charges of espionage after the publication of more than 250,000 US diplomatic despatches on the WikiLeaks website against secrecy.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Yeltysheva," translated into French.
Recall that his novel became the finalist of four awards: "Clear Glade," "Russian Buker," "National Bestseller" and "Big Book."
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded a prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is an undoubted leader in the generation of the current thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prosaics.
Almost every publication of its hard, built on modern life material stories and stories causes hot disputes among critics of various directions.
It can be argued that the articles collected together about prose and journalism Senchin, reviews on his books and journal publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial contemporary writers," according to critic Sergei Chuprinin, the speech is mostly about what its participants understand by the word "literature," as they see the present and the future not only of our literature, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow to include in it most of the articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and overview articles are usually given in the reduction in the sections "Abzats..."
Snowdens may be interrogated in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden is likely not to go outside Russia to give testimony on the cases of wiretapping the telephone conversations of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As Interfax told a source familiar with the situation on Friday, the American can answer questions from the German Prosecutor General's Office in writing or in person in Russia.
The withdrawal of Edward Snowden outside Russia is almost impossible.
"In this case, he will lose the status of refugee and can be granted to Washington by the countries - the allies of the United States," the agency's interlocutor said.
"In cooperation, in principle, the German Prosecutor General's Office could send its representatives to the Russian Federation or submit written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, German Bundestag MP Hans-Christian Strebele said that Edward Snowden is ready to give testimony in the case of hearing the German Chancellor's negotiations by the U.S. intelligence services.
Snowden is ready to give testimony to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in Germany.
The ex-member of the CIA made it clear that he knew a lot.
Despite the fact that the NSA blocked all its movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival," - said Strebele to Euronews.
Lawyer Snowden Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement of the source of Interfax, said that his client can cooperate with German investigators, but when and how - will decide for himself.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, and then published information about the secret operations of the U.S. intelligence services on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but could not leave the airport due to the fact that his passport was annulled by the U.S. authorities, who in absentia brought him serious charges, and until early August remained in the transit zone of the airport "Sheremetyevo."
On August 1, Snowden received a document on granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a year and left Sheremetyevo on the same day.
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said that his client settled for a job in a "large Russian company."
German media reported on NSA surveillance for Angela Merkel last week.
According to journalists, the Chancellor's telephone conversations began to be heard back in 2002.
The surveillance station was allegedly at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
After the publication of this information, the German authorities stated that Merkel's surveillance violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Announced about the release of the racing series Land Rover
Inside are racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as internal communication system.
Additionally, you can get upgraded brakes, a package of services that provide access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage of the car between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The participants of the rally, addressing Bowler, have changed.
Some of them are not experienced riders, and people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try different disciplines of rally in the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of rally raid.
We have enjoyed developing the car Defender Challenge - it will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to participate in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Children should study myths and legends as "model of the way of life," says the author.
The Tale of the Torah could show that the rough power cannot defeat the refined cunning, and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Speaking that many myths will be too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools, Cross-Holland stands for the inaccompanishing selection of the appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I spoke for the introduction of them in the training program for twenty years.
He added that the immorality of the authors and teachers beats the interest of children, and the main ideas are subby in fascinating stories.
Cross-country Holland, which translated "Beowulf" with the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote "A collection of Norwegian myths" for the publishing house Penguin and "Britan folk tales," said: "You, of course, may be intentions, but you'd better keep them with you."
Perhaps a great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or led to a happy ending, but it is necessary to have an innate understanding of good and evil.
And this must be sublimated; it is revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
The old principle: to show, not to tell.
Goldman Sachs warned about risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment on unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions of employees.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of this growth.
Recently, it is completely due to consumption, which almost does not reduce turnover," said Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs in Russia Clemens Graf, presenting yesterday the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
With inflation of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at approximately the current level, it is expected in Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so they are likely to optimize the costs of personnel.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, the GDP is only 2%, - said Mr. Graf.
The companies faced a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to dismissal and an increase in unemployment.
The Russian business cannot raise salaries, says Vladimir Pantyushin, chief economist of Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS.
Unemployment near historical lows, competition for workers is high.
In order to lure employees from the outside or to keep the current ones, employers have to raise salaries.
The consumption in Russia is also under the very rapid growth of demand for credit.
According to Mr. Graf, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans, this type of credit does not have a multiplicative effect on the economy of the country.
"We saw no benefits for the economy from the growth of consumer lending, the money does not diverge in the economy, but return to the same banks in the form of interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem is different - Goldman Sachs expects a rise in overdue loans.
They are taken mostly by poor people who have nothing to provide in security.
Interest rates on such loans are high.
As a result, they are not returned more often," - said Mr. Graf.
Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payment on unsecured loans.
Vasily Solodkov, Director of the HSE Banking Institute, sees signs of an arzying banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, having no access to cheap resources, which state banks have, were forced to raise the population's funds at high interest rates.
In response, the state banks went to the path of war and began to reduce credit rates, - continues the economist.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same interest rates, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state banks do not give up the damping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, says Vasily Solodkov.
In recent weeks, the economist considers the exercible to be a cestorm of the licenses of a number of banks.
"The state banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not initially designed for a system crisis," the head of the institute warns.
But the growth of consumption will slow down without a crisis of non-payment, according to the investment bank, due to the refusal to index the wages of civil servants and military, laid in the current version of the draft budget.
Partially the blow to consumption will be softened by the freezing of tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, a decline in inflation).
But only partially: if the investments do not grow (and there are no prerequisites for this - see the reference), the growth of consumption will still slow down, are confident in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Panthyushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see any prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still the drop in the price of oil," he says.
According to him, the Russian economy will begin to shrink at the cost of oil below $ 90/bbl.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical pattern: inflation declined, and banks began to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to inflation targeting," Clemens Graf said.
The Central Bank's interest policy does not affect market rates, affects only the interbank lending rates.
"For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hopes," said Clemens Graf.
The money received at the auctions of the Central Bank, banks are not used to lend to the economy, but to manage their liquidity
As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate immediately changes, it means that the funds are trying to go on speculation against the ruble.
"Emerit or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work," said Mr. Graf, and reminded that the state plans to launch the ruble into "free voyage" by the end of 2015.
But he believes that it will have to do it before or raise the key interest rate of the Central Bank (5.5%).
According to him, the ruble rate is now artificially overpriced by 10%.
I have only one road - to weaken, - concludes the expert.
But if the Central Bank casts a shadow of doubt in the financiers that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it can hit the ruble much stronger.
Snowden agreed to give testimony about the hearing of Merkel
Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the conversation, the question was whether Snowden could be interrogated as a witness by the German Prosecutor General's Office in the case of a possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor's phone by the U.S. Special Assurs.
Snowden expressed readiness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, - said Hans-Christian Strebele, - that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency headed by Kit Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first it is necessary to clearly determine all the conditions of his arrival. .
Meanwhile, American legislators are beginning to take action in response to the scandal around US spyware.
Yesterday, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the US electronic intelligence agency.
FAU: "Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but do not call from a mobile phone) "
Passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect that the changes will occur immediately.
How quickly this change is implemented, will vary depending on the airline, said the administrator of the FAU Michael Werta at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show FAU how their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they update their teaching aids for the flight crew members and the rules for laying devices to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already presented plans.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon, " said the FAU.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the door of the plane closes.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain will not give.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is reduced to land, and do not include them until the plane is on the ground.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference can allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, said FAU.
Most of the new airliners and other aircraft modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes is expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Gleiding, president of the Association of Professional Aconductors, welcomed these changes.
"After the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option, Glading said.
We are frankly tired of feeling on duty at school when it comes to this question.
But Internet connection for surfing, e-mail sharing, text messages or data download will still be prohibited at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices into the mode of the aircraft.
Thus, there are still no "Words with friends" - intellectual Internet games, in which actor Alek Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when there was a notorious case: the actor was removed from the plane of American Airlines for refusal to turn off the device at the time when the plane was at the exit of landing.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be placed in the luggage compartment, as they can hurt someone if they fly around the cabin.
Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also be prohibited.
Regulatory powers by telephone calls belong to the Federal Communications Commission, not FAU.
FAU may remove the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Council for Transport Safety, a national expert on transport security CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered to be risk.
"The jack phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference for navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCS that they can create obstacles to cell towers when the plane is in the air," said Rosenker.
The industry advisory committee, created by the FAU to study this issue, recommended last month for the government to allow the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAU has increased in order to weaken the restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri democrat Senator Claire McCasquill, claim that there are no good reasons for the bans related to security.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAU began to limit the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference for navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radio receivers - high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by FAU as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines offer passengers the use of Wi-Fi at the cruise height for several years.
The aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are adapted for the wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, said Werta.
Today's electronic devices usually emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading e-books, for example, radiate only minimal signals when page flips.
But signals become more powerful when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com was among those seeking restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's representatives downloaded a whole airliner with their devices for reading e-books Kindle and flew on it to check the presence of problems, but did not find them.
Members of the advisory committee of the FAU expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of devices is any risk.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Air Passengers said that he considers the interference from the devices real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only individual messages of pilots confirming that devices can create obstacles for aviation systems, and most of these messages are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAU allows pilots to require passengers to disconnect the devices during landings on the devices in limited visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sane step towards passengers who are now using many technological devices.
"We are pleased that the FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with the safety and protection," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and Eastern Partnership countries - such a statement was made to the agency BNS in the Department of State Security of the Republic (FGB).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular Moscow is going to "speak" Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian Gosarchive, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the special services, the Department of Analysis of Public Processes of the Presidential Administration for Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries conducts preparation of the information attack.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania more than once and took part in the congress of the Lithuanian People's Party.
Also the participant of the operation is allegedly an employee of the department V. Smirnov.
According to the special service, Smirnov, under cover of scientific work until the end of 2012 regularly came to Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Now Smirnov is prohibited from entering the territory of the country.
On the eve of the Lithuanian President Grybauskaite said she knew about the upcoming informative.
According to her, the main reason is the successful chairmanship of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and "the desire of the country for energy independence"
The Lithuanian leader has not once criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she stated that the Kremlin treats Lithuania "insufficiently respectful."
In addition, Grybauskaite accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of nominating "one demands" to Lithuania.
Recall that in September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended import of Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products does not meet sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Then the Lithuanian leader said that if Russia does not remove the ban, the government should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
New antinicotine vaccine can deprive the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an antinicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes pleasure.
One dose of vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before the trials on people, which will take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the Medical College of Well Cornell in New York said that the first results are encouraging.
We very much hope that such a strategy of vaccine application can finally help millions of smokers who tried to quit by having tried to try to try out all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with the help of these modern means," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information for the production of antinicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the receipt of nicotine shock by the smoker.
In the tests, vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And the mice, which did not give the vaccine, were sweetened, and this is a sign that nicotine came to their brains, - the researchers say.
These experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into an antibodies factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they had a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not get pleasure from it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but warned that additional research is necessary.

Frontier Airlines will charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for the fact that they carry hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will be able to leave themselves the whole bank.
The new hand luggage fee applies to the bags in the upper luggage compartments, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said that it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100, if travelers pay only when they are at the exit to land.
The representative of Frontier Kate O'Malley said that the fee of $100 should make passengers take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to charge for this," she said.
Airlines began to charge for the first and second bag, handed in luggage, in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these fees, stuff as much as they can, in the hand luggage placed in the upper luggage compartments, which is why in these compartments often lack space.
Fees are one of the ways to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said that this new collection was not really for the sake of making money.
The fact is that the most loyal customers Frontier claim that finding a place in the upper luggage compartments is becoming more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the exit of the flight Frontier can get the opportunity to carry the bag for free, while the next passenger in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that changing the procedures on the website and the Frontier check-in counters are designed to ensure that passengers will be aware of the collection before they get to land.
The new collection of Frontier for hand luggage will not begin to be charged until summer, although the date is not yet set.
Passengers often complain about the fee for luggage and other fees, but the airlines ate them.
They claim that the processing of luggage costs money, and passengers who need this service, have to pay for it.
Many in Wall Street consider the addition of baggage fees sign that the airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of losses.
However, most of them did not touch the fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection for hand luggage three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed her example.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said the consultant for airlines Jay Sorensen, who carefully monitors the supplementary fees.
According to his estimates in the December 2011 report, the collection of hand luggage brings the Spirit's collection of $50 million per year.
Sorensen, former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew on a Spirit flight, and it was interesting that he would find at the exit to land when passengers will face an unusual assembly of the Spirit for hand luggage.
"The landing process was the most sleek of those I saw during my career in the airlines," he said.
I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the appearance of a fight at the exit to land.
The plane was full, he said, and the landing went swiftly.
Frontier also follows the Spirit for a fee of $2 per coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who receive soda or juice can leave themselves the whole jar and that the tea of coffee will be provided free of charge.
It will still be free to distribute water.
US Airways for a short time tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but refused to do so seven months after passengers began to complain and no other major airline followed her example.
The Frontier initiative to charge hand luggage fees when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, this is its last measure to attract customers to your website.
Airlines pay online ticket to the online salesers, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than contact the travel online agency.
However, Frontier went farther all in this area.
In September, she began to give twice as much bonus miles of frequent flying passengers to customers who bought tickets through the online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut off the premium number of miles to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.
So, a trip of 1000 miles with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would allow you to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the website Frontier.
Frontier has a base of loyal customers in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and becomes unprofitable.
Revenue declined by 9% and flight opportunities declined by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to improve the finances of Frontier as part of the sale of the airline.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now - news from outside the ocean, namely - from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel attacked Russian-made missiles, which, according to reports, were intended "Hezbollah."
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its chemical weapons by November 1.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached through the mediation of Russia and allowed the United States not to carry out a military operation, to which they came close this summer.
Our main international correspondent Richard Engel will tell us more about weapons and what all this means for the Syrian president.
Washington said that the Assad regime would be punished for that.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died of poison gas in August.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal, which was arranged by friend Assad - Vladimir Putin.
Syria will renounce its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria has failed the declared chemical weapons factories.
A longer-term and harder task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and components.
As we understand, this is about a thousand tons.
Earlier, Washington said that the days of Assad were numbered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and must leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops still use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and badly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are hungry.
Some have to feed on leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad has escaped punishment for mass murder.
The chemical weapons agreement is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made an impression of a person ready for cooperation.
Today, in Washington, the U.S. ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, his mother is hardly easier because he was not killed by chemical weapons.
As long as the Assad is holding.
And changes weapons to power.
Tomic to work 240 hours for an extremist video on a social network
The Leninsky District Court of Tomsk sentenced a resident of the city to 240 hours of mandatory work, which posted on the social network a video of extremist orientation, reported RIA Novosti on Friday, a representative of the press service of the regional court.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his popular social network page, which was included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was opened against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as humiliation of human dignity committed publicly."
"Leninsky district court examined the case in a special order and found a man guilty of committing the above crime, appointing a punishment in the form of 240 hours of mandatory work," the agency's interlocutor said.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Parents of intersexual children can choose the undributable floor "
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex in children born with external sexual organs of intermediate type.
The newborn will no longer be required to ascribe male or female floor.
The new law does not require parents to call any sex of such children, allowing parents to indicate sex as an indefinite or in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions on sexual assignment of sexually reborn, and to counteract discrimination of intersexual people.
One intersexual, according to BBC, said many years later: I am not a man and not a woman.
I will remain a patchwork product created by doctors with bruises and scars.
Approximately one of the two thousand children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions, which are diagnosed with sexual development, a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (egg or sedious men) or unusually developed by the external sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been an intersexual.
Gender identification is still insufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that if the floor cannot be defined, it is better to take advantage of all available information and assign it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if this happens at all.
New York Psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Dresher, who specializes in the problems of gender identification, said that the new German law is screaming as a good idea.
Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening violations that require surgical intervention, but most children do not have them," he said.
You can assign the floor without an operation and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexual people as different from transsexual or transgender, since their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to male or female sex, but typically for both at the same time or not characteristic of any of them.
These characteristics can be manifested in secondary genital traits such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and physique; primary genital traits such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also gives a general idea of discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in the field of employment, as well as the level of oppression, cruelty and prejudice crimes.
Boys with gender deviations now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowed adults to put male, female or third sex in their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old resident of Australia Norry May-Walby became the first man in the world, recognized by the unfive, defending in court the right to preserve the undeni-determined sex status for a lifetime.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passports will use the third designation in addition to M and F X, that is, intersexual.
In neighboring France, gender issues still cause contradictions, according to the news on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, this pronounced Catholic country, signed a petition on the withdrawal of the Igender theory from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed disagreement with the German law, writing that in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state, where sex is the subject of choice, and sexual activity is not, we turn over two more pillars of civilization.
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported to Baby Zone website that she would prefer children to install sex at birth.
"Revenge a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the gender of your child," she said to the website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, named after a beautiful Greek god, who had signs of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which you can erase everything, and then draw again.
But now many are challenging the ethical basis for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and doctors sometimes make an incorrect choice, not knowing how the child will perceive the assigned floor when it grows.
"In the middle of the 20th century it was called "imperform psychiatric case," " said Dresher.
When such children were born, you called not a psychiatrist - you called the surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitals was proposed by Dr. John Mani from Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily changed.
He introduced the term "mander identity" into circulation and argued that environmental signals, including social ones, how parents grow a child, interact with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were questionable.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during careless circumcision, completely dissecting the child, removing also his testics, and to raise it as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it was not so," said Dresher.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at the age of 38 he committed suicide.
Dresher said that now some doctors still use this model.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the people who survived these sex change operations declared themselves, the unsatisfied result.
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but intermediate-type genitals.
The little one could not determine exactly whether he had a big clitoral or a small penis, and they were convinced that he would never be able to live a full life of a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, the outer sexual organ and eggs of Bruce were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He began to give female hormones at the age of 12 years.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he was appointed vaginoplasty.
But being in depression and realizing that something is wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he knew was awful.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born in sexual development, which did not allow his body to produce testosterone enough for the normal development of genitals.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, getting injections of testosterone and removing his breasts.
The operation made it sterile.
Today he advocates the protection of others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexuality.
But Anne Témar-Matti, Executive Director of the Advocates for Informed Choice California, is concerned that the German law is inciting to put on labels and stigma.
"Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make hasty decisions and give the child "indefinite sex," she said.
We are afraid that he will contribute to intervention.
We believe that it is better to appropriate the male or female floor, and then wait.
But we have not seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is to build assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law, as it allows adults to make a choice in favor of the third sex.
"Elegrown people should be able to make their own decisions about formal sex," she says.
The German law implies its appropriation at birth.
It is a battle in which young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But D.Arlin Barats, a mammologist-rentgenologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with sexual development and who helps the hundred other people in the support group, said that the German law supports both parents and children.
Barats' daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called syndronism to androgens.
Since its androgenic receptors work incorrectly, Katie has developed female signs.
She has a vagina, but there is no uterus and ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and takes a residency of children's psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite the fact that she is barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or geational surrogate motherhood.
"The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions by itself," said Barats.
He gives them time to do some analyses and understand the situation, as well as the period of time before they write the "muzhenskaya" or the "zhensky."
In this case, you are in order - raise the child, love the child.
You have a wonderful child and you feel joy.
We do not need to hurriedly do an operation that is irreversible.
This allows children to participate in the solution and eliminate the excitement that drives parents, because they do not feel what is right, she said.
In the end, the child will decide with which sex he or her more comfortable, and it is wonderful.
This gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.
U.S. Secretary of State: special services sometimes "hel gone too far" when collecting data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that when collecting data and hearings, the U.S. intelligence services sometimes "has gone too far," nevertheless, the politician noted that the information that appeared in the media about the examination of 70 million people is not true.
I assure you that innocent people have not suffered during this process, but the attempt to collect information has been.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was inappropriate.
I will admit this, as the president admits... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future," the Secretary of State of AFP quotes.
Experts of equestrian events, going to Cardiff to fight for the prize "Low Year," knew that the competition will be very high.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before, who took his first steps, this kid with his pet of the Swiss pony Taffy trotting rushed through three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable pair - the same growth - received high marks for the appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition, which is held by the center of equestrian sports Sannibenk in Radry near Cardiff.
Going out on the public view against the background of men and women in elegant caps, he moved his cap on the back and proudly spent in a circle of two-year-old Taffy.
The judges praised Fenton for his not by years the developed innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffy received the highest rating for appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Taffy on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been dealing with the Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Fenton and Taffy make up a beautiful duo."
They had many rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and rose.
It was only his second performance with Toffy, and we were all delighted when he won.
Absolutely unfamiliar people in the arena considered it so phenomenal that they wanted to take pictures with him.
This boy from the village of Nantuglo, near Ebb-Walthy in South Wales, walks in the footsteps of his Aunt Sharon Howels, who has been exerceing horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howls said, "All the audience was amazed, and everyone shouted approving and clapping."
He ran through the sand along the entire length of the arena, and though he looked so tiny, he did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Judging by the way he began, he will soon take part in the Loshadi of the year, and I am sure that he will speak well.
The representative of this annual equestrian exhibition said: "Fentonu is only three years old, but he knows how to treat his ponit.
Together they are a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and for how they presented themselves in the show ring.
They assess the coherence of the performance of the ny and the breeder - Fenton and Taffy were the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fenton helped his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.

The court suspended execution of the decision on practice of the Stop-and-and-sight" decision at the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal of the Federal District suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes in the program to stop-and-a-to-squiet the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the second district of the United States said that the execution of the decisions of Judge Shira Sheyndlin will be suspended until the results of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the constitution in how he carried out a program for street detentions and interrogators.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and regulations on corrective measures, including the order to appoint a controller to help the police department change the practice of work and its related training program.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeals heard the parties" debates on the request to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeals declared the need to withdraw the judge due to the fact that it violated the code of conduct of the U.S. judges and did not consider it necessary to avoid demonstrating bias, partly due to a series of interviews in the media and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unreasonably addressing black and Latin Americans under the program to stop-and-and-to-supt.
She appointed an external controller to oversee large-scale changes, which include reforms in the field of politician, training and control, and also decided to launch a pilot program for testing video cameras fixed on the body in those police stations where most of the detentions take place.
In August, New York came to the decision to stop the practice of storing names and addresses of people whose cases were terminated after a police check.
The debate on the appeal of the city should take place after March 14, 2014.
Tactics stopping and searched was criticized by many lawyers on civil rights.
"Stop-Obsk has been practiced for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically during the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are black and Latin Americans.
In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, filed a collective lawsuit against the court.
Supporters of changes in the program to stop-and-and-by-see in the New York Police Department say that these changes will end to unfair practice, form a more reliable and effective police service and can affect how other police departments implement this practice.
Opponents claim that the changes will reduce the combat spirit of the police, rather than the level of crime, will lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police due to the reduction of the number of officers by several thousand in the last decade.
The judge noted that she does not stop the practice of stopping-and-and-cow, which corresponds to the constitution, but changes the way the New York police stops people.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse of prices for goods after the signing of the association with the European Union
Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will significantly decrease after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with the readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, among which there are, including customs payments.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provisions on the free trade zone, the level of customs duties on the import of goods from the EU will decrease significantly.
And this will mean that prices should also decline.
"This is as regards the goods that come from the EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
But, nevertheless, there should also be no price increase.
Therefore, messages on billboards, which recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is an increase in prices, it is not quite so, or, more precisely, it is not so," Azarov summed up.
A package of rescue measures in the amount of $325 million for Tasmania's health
The Federal Government insists that a $325 million rescue package for the weakened Tasmania health system will be supplemented by strict conditions that ensure that the state government will not waste money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanja Plibersec announced that the Commonwealth is taking time measures to prevent the crisis caused by the aging population of this island state, a higher level of chronic diseases and limitations of the system.
The decision on funding for four years was made after the government's consultations with independent deputy Tasmania Andrew Wielki.
"The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures, which, we believe, will solve the specific problems facing the state, - said today Mrs. Plibersec.
The $325mn package includes $31mn on blitz campaign for planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataracts, will help to overcome the lag.
There is also money for clinics taking patients without prior appointment, in Hobart and Loneston, to improve the quality of care after the hospital, training medical professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical cards systems in local hospitals.
"These investments will be used by the advanced doctors to implement the ideas on how to better help the Tasmania health system," said Ms. Plibersec.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmania government would work in strict reporting and responsibility.
The state will need to maintain the current funding levels in order to receive the funds of the Commonwealth, and monthly report on where it spends these additional funds.
A commission of three will be set up to ensure that the staff provides services as efficiently and more efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wielki said today that $325 million will not decide anything, if they are not followed by an authentic reform, which will put the Tasmania health system on a more stable basis.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for his request for urgent assistance, with which he first addressed the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the package of federal aid will significantly contribute to the withdrawal of the health system of this state from the critical state," said Mr. Wilki.
According to the state government, these additional selective procedures largely compensate for recent cuts.
But the federal oppositional representative for health care Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is a decision similar to the leukoplastyru.
The reason we are here is that the labor government of the state has tore $430 million out of the health system," he said to ABC TV.
When the state government tears off almost half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, it is impossible to pretend that this is good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Mr. Plibersec to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Obama's Cry of Desperate of Obama's Voter
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for changes
He says that Obama allowed obstructionism of the Republicans to negate the good-by-dance efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with Obama's reformed health system, drone attacks
The memoirs of Obama's 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student of the Harvard University Medical Faculty.
I read a terrible sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me in the time of the dissatisfied at the second year of the medical faculty and revive in me a feeling of hope.
It is called the "Dierence for Victory" and these are memoirs about the presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.
When I finish writing reports on my patients in the evening and go to bed, this book brings me back at a time when politics inspired millions of people and performances could capture the spirit.
The victory in the elections was impressive, and the leading news programs made a pause to comprehend this historical moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents took care of all the newspapers they could only find.
A young team of strategists was supposed to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
During Obama's inauguration in 2008, his support level was 82 %.
Then I close the book.
The return to the present is a gross awakening, as a retrievion from the dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism - they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of the missed opportunities.
Over the years since I lowered my first ballot paper, the changes have indeed taken place.
It was something I couldn't imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on available medical assistance to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the abolition of the rule "Don't ask, don't say, the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to promote our country forward: immigration reform, the possibility of choosing public health and closing the base in Guantanamo among others.
But after countless times, when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending it in front of colleagues and peers, I ended with the explanations I can provide.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The obstructionism of Republicans cannot explain the permission to listen to foreign leaders or strikes by drones on innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain the collection of data on the private life of the Americans by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of expositors revealing the government's unlawful actions.
He cannot explain the murder of an American citizen Anvar al-Avlaki without trial or non-compliance with the limits of state funding and expenditures during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which states that the efforts made by the White House, in order to silence the media, are the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration.
And recently he can not justify what is not possible to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the law on available medical care.
I don't know if I should expect it.
Should I have been at the age of 18 to understand that the leadership may contradict the political campaigns that precede it?
It is obvious that working for an elective position is not a predictable program of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by the opposition political party and such random events as the slaughter in Newtown.
Nevertheless, all the examples mentioned above show that they were largely the choice of the administration.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, it seemed that he was unable to make a decision on his own politics or views.
I believed that in my second term, Obama would justify the hopes we had heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating fell below 45% this week, it became much more difficult to return in 2008 through this book.
This makes me go for many promises that have fled.
This week I read the part of the book described by Clinton to defeat Obama in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting to analyze the causes of the failure, he told his employees that they should return to normal and remain true to their goal.
"I want us to return our attractiveness," he said.
We must remember who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The opinions expressed in this opinion belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
In Egypt takes oath of the first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi takes an oath, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Mursi promised the new Egypt, when he swore, becoming the first free elected president of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the bank of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We aim for the better future, new Egypt and the second republic," Mursi said during the solemn ceremony shown live on the state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said Mursi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American education from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which most of the 84 years of its existence was a banned organization that served as a target for the tough actions of the successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Mursi arrived with a small cortege shortly after 11 am local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the court building to greet the new president, and, unlike the presidential pump of Mubarak's times, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his autocolumn on the usual bustling road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
Although Mursi was ridiculed as an uncharistic "Brother's wheel," his personal prestige has grown dramatically since his victory and Friday's speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only of Islamists, but also all those who want to bring to the end the uprising of 2011 against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, judges in a wooden panel of the hall, where he took an oath.
Later Mursi went to Cairo University, where he had to pronounce his inauguration speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra that performed the national anthem, during which he stood at the counter of the Smyrnoe.
There was a military worker Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.
His arrival was greeted by the slogan "Army and the people," one hand, which chanted hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where the uprising, which ended the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year, and promised to return the powers of the president, whom his office was deprived of by the military council, who accepted the affairs of the overthrown leader.
But having agreed to take an official oath before the court, not before the parliament, as is customary, it fulfills the will of the military, and it is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech on Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Schools urged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses of English literature will require students to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and modern British art literature since 1914.
The exam will also feature extra-programmatical texts to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Since 2015, students will be required to pass a separate graduation exam in the language, with persistent recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education should release tomorrow new curricula in English and mathematics - the first subjects to be radically reviewed.
It will make changes to other major items next year.
Separately regulatory body in the field of exams OFQUAL will present the revised structure of high school graduation exams, with a new system of evaluations and a smaller volume of term papers.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that a broad consensus was reached that we must reform our system of exams to regain public trust, insisting that school graduation exams will be more complex, more ambitious and more stringent.
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and in Singapore students are engaged in about 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time in the schedule of mathematics, the sources in the coalition said that large-scale school graduation exams in mathematics combined with an increased ratio in the rating table, will most likely serve as an incentive to provide schools with additional training on this subject.
In the curriculum, more attention will be paid to the real life, including financial mathematics.
Football is the reason for discord?
In the Duma, politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve the national peace in Russia within the framework of the Open Tribune.
Among the proposals, there was a: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because from this game - some scandals and discord.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that in order to reduce the "degree of tension in society" politicians and the media should be correct in statements.
Probably, he meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV programs threatened to overthrew the Caucasus with barbed wire, if he did not want to limit the birth rate...
All speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which gave the discussion to be cumbersome.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulev are "a model conflict that could be predicted," but "we have too many people and authorities for these questions," and seven nurses have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has practiced for a long time with regard to migrants has failed, and it is necessary to look for its own way.
Historian Yuri Petrov laid great hopes on a new single textbook of history.
"It is still necessary to create a manual on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what people live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to introduce criminal responsibility for "calls to dismember Russia": "If the United States says on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years of prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard to "not kindle."
As usual, he accused journalists who are suffering from sick and acute national problems for public discussion: "There is little to say in the heat of controversy!"
United Russia faction leader Vladimir Vasiliev immediately advised journalists to conclude a "Khartia" and agree to negotiate on this issue carefully, and then the same obligations can be undertaken by politicians.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order is generally established, said Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he cited a law that imposes on regional and municipal authorities the responsibility for international peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko did not share her delight about this law: he has "a clear idea of what adaptation of migrants is, about its mechanisms and limits.
Therefore, the subjects will interpret in different ways the scope of these powers.
In addition, municipalities do not have the staff necessary to solve such complex issues, and the methodical recommendations they could use do not give them...
Head of the Duma Committee for Nationalities Hajimet Safaraliyev proposed to establish a special agency with a formidable name "Ministry of National Security," which would deal with issues of national policy.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s headed a similar department, which was abolished later, opposed.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, "a minister without a portfolio," to which it would be possible to address, if anything.
"We walk around the edge, shells are rushing around, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to speak together against provocations, and this work should receive decent information support," said the representative of the ROC on relations with the society Vsevolod Chaplin.
In his opinion, there should be no neutrality of the state with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones.
Here Oleg Nilov led the discussion in an unexpected way: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan still need to look for, but they are pushed on the wrong way, not on the road," he said.
"Not that road" - is the development of football: "That footballer beat the whole crowd, the flags harness, then comrades stones throw each other...
Maybe we do not need such football?
There is another sport - rugby called...
"The savage will not be in the world in this sport!" - said right-wing Russia fervently.
No one will play in the rugby in the Caucasus! - Mr. Zhirinovsky immediately intervened.
You'll offer them more curling!
It is necessary to know national peculiarities, it's like the Georgian "Zaporozhets" to offer..."
In Yaroslavl, the wild behavior on the stands distinguished representatives of the Moscow club - during a game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned throughout the country...
National Security Agency recognizes strengthen the paranoia of corporations against state surveillance
The warm day in late August, the German police helicopter flew low over the US Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
According to the instructions of the Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German internal intelligence service, his task was to photograph the roof of the US representative office building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media say that BfV hoped to detect antennas of listening devices, and these actions entailed negotiations between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of the US National Intelligence Agency, once again assured in September that the U.S. does not use the possibility of foreign intelligence to steal commercial secrets of foreign companies in the interests of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.
But since Edward Snowden, a contract officer who became the exposer, began to publish his treasury of the secrets of the U.S. intelligence, European governments and company leaders are no longer sure whether it is possible to believe the director.
Reports that the US National Security Agency followed the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised the paranoia of corporations caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been listened to, perhaps, for about ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, potential targets are business leaders.
Snowden made obvious intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I think it is likely that this data is used with mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Gryun, president of the BITMi association, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. is now almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
In all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, there has been no evidence that the United States has transferred commercial secrets to foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain opportunities in the field of information technologies and the Internet, and expressed the opinion that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says that we should create German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
This is not an option, says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software provider company SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT-industry, it was not worth to let it die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the coverage and technical development of U.S. espionage agencies, which became known thanks to Snowden's revelations, were shocked by some companies that used to think that China was the biggest risk of surveillance.
A big shift takes place in cloud technologies, where European companies have better realized that the data stored in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance trade association, about 10% of its non-American participants refused to use the services of the US cloud provider after the US disclosure program for the intelligent Prism data analysis.
Jim Sneib, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: "We see that consumers are asking a new question that did not arise a year ago, namely: where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction.
Many German leaders claim that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore, these data must be protected at any cost.
What is going on is not surprising.
He always happened.
This was the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current polemics," says Kurt Bock, Chief Executive Officer of BASF chemical company.
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we also spy on them because it is part of our national interests - to protect our commercial enterprises.
The leaders of corporations usually do not like to boast of the response measures they have taken, as this can give an advantage to the opponent.
In large companies has long been learned the idea that to take a free USB flash drive at the exhibition or leave a laptop unattended in the hotel room - it is at least careless.
Ulrich Hakenberg, member of Audi's automotive company's board, says that for many years it's a standard practice - collect mobile phones before the board meetings so that they can not be used as listening devices.
The Federal Service for Protection of the Constitution of Germany recommends the heads of companies to consider the use of simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign trips due to vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are fears that small and medium-slee companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are the leaders in the world market in their specific niche.
"Little and medium-sized companies often lack experience, employees and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrecy from unauthorized access, - warns in the report BfV.
The U.S. warns its own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
The Washington Post states that the U.S. National Intelligence Report in February put France together with Russia and Israel in a number of violators who are engaged in hacking for economic intelligence, after China.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, the French is the worst.
Bernard Skarsini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: "Services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies.
Los Angeles International Airport was evacuated due to shooting in one of the terminals.
Unknown man opened fire in the third terminal at 09.30 local time on Friday, November 1 (20.30 MSK).
The guards evacuated employees and passengers of the second and third terminal.
According to preliminary data, the man was shooting from a high-power rifle.
Several people, including the US Transport Safety Office, were injured.
The police opened the retaliatory fire and detained the attacker.
He is easily wounded.
Tripode denies that Obuid is influenced
Former Minister of Labor of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be a defendant in the investigation of the anti-corruption supervisory authority of this state.
Former Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi refutes the amendment of the order of lease of coastal facilities at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned shares in three properties on state land.
On Friday, the Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obid was lobbying for the extension of the lease agreements on Serccular Ki, where the Beabied family owns two restaurants and cafes without passing the tender after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating the assertion that Mr. Tripode knew about the secret participation of Mr. Obyd in real estate, after the testimony given by the former deputy head of the administration of Mr. Tripoly Lynn Ashpoul on Thursday.
For several years of discussions that began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be submitted to an open competition.
The tenants were against this, and also wanted longer rental terms.
In 2009, the lease agreements of enterprises to Sercuryar Ki, which brought the family of Obeydov about $2.5 million per year, were extended without being submitted to the open competition.
Mr. Tripode, who was the Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially played for open competitions.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripode admitted, strongly advised to make changes to the government's rental policy.
The CAC presented the interpretation of telephone conversations included talks in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obera, Mr. Tripode and Steve Dan, senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the leadership of Mr. Oberdea in the fishing department.
"Was the question discussed during these telephone conversations, the development of the commercial lease policy? " asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wiely Mr. Tripodi.
"Noth," Mr. Tripode replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it wasn't that.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obud.
UN announces new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations should immediately begin to work on a new set of tasks to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty all over the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting the Sustainable Development of the World's Sustainable Development - to replace the MDG, which expires in 2015, before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro on the eve of the evening.
They were included in the final version of the document, which will be submitted by world leaders, including Mr. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said yesterday evening to the participants of the summit that now it is time to get above the national interests.
"I am glad that the UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating universal sustainable development goals - SDG," he said.
These SDGs will rely on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, they will become an integral part of the concept of development for the period after 2015.
I will make every effort to use the powers granted to me by the member countries to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
In the utility payments of Voronezh citizens there will be a new line of expenses - deductions for major repairs of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact standard will be determined by the government of the region.
But when to paint the entrance, put the staircases in order or even replace the elevator - the tenants themselves will decide.
Such a law was approved by deputies of the regional council.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, it is also necessary to restore order - to establish the order of repair of houses, to accumulate funds not in the management companies - which we often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, then somewhere else, it will be the establishment of state control over the expenditure of funds that residents collect for the repair of multi-apartment buildings."
Under the control of the state now and shared construction.
The law, which protects against fraudsters, is approved by the regional Duma in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4,500 people suffered from dishonest developers.
The majority of problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes the rights and obligations for all participants in shared construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that in this area also began abuses associated with the fact that in 98 the shareholders got the same, and in the 2000s the same shareholders."
People began to earn on this to cover up the loophole, including those adopted these two laws.
Under Voronezh it was decided to build a temporary stay center for foreign citizens to be deported.
The regional parliament adopted such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
Problems related to illegal migrants in the region at least get rid of.
Thus, last year a little more than 100,000 foreigners stood for migration registration.
But only one in five issued an official work permit.
Where the others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They violated the legislation, but are not criminals."
There is no court, and it is necessary to deport - they must be kept somewhere.
This decision of the federation has taken that at the expense of regional funds such places to equip such places.
In the Voronezh region such a place is defined - it is Staraya Olshanka Semiluki district.
And finally, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families where 5 or more children are brought completely exempt from the transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but the same amount saves and large parents.
Secondly, and this is the main thing for those who adopt 3 or more babies, from the new year will issue housing subsidies.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30 thousand per meter.
Family, for example, of 6 people - dad, mom, mother, mother and 3rd - adopted.
For them, according to the standards, the state buys housing of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or south-west neighborhood - quite an acceptable option.
Well, in the regional center for this amount you can buy a whole cottage.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have released recommendations for schools related to allergies in children
On Wednesday, centers for disease control and prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations, which was issued by the US government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is growing.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergy among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of teachers and service personnel about food allergies in children and how to help in case of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline reserves - most often for injections used automatic medical syringe EpiPen - to assist in potentially deadly anaphylaxis.
The state legislators have recently amended the regulations to allow schools to make adrenaline reserves with less difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say: "Such a feeling, as if something is going to be in my tongue, the feeling that I have hair in my tongue? or the tongue pinch.
Kenyan Press outraged by provocative law on media
This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for the question: what can prevent the Parliament to destroy the independence of the judiciary in the future?
"This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it," said Sairus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, the parent company CapitalFM, which includes one of the most respected independent radio stations and news website in Kenya.
He said that the new judicial body by the media will always be biased, as it is a continuation of the government, and restrictions on content and advertising will harm Kenya's situation in the global economy.
I hope that the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.
According to The Star, the new law will essentially allow the government to take the media with a dead grip, and The Standard said that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have received a serious blow, and criticized the bill as "Drakonovsky."
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security after the September attack of Muslim terrorists in the Westgate shopping center.
The Kenyan media provoked the anger of the authorities, translating the recordings of surveillance cameras, where the troops, which were sent to the site of the attack, allegedly rob the expensive shopping center.
The reaction of the police chief David Kimeio was the challenge of two journalists and media officials to the interrogation, although the challenge was cancelled after mass media protests.
According to the new law, the publishing house can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists up to one million with an additional risk of being excluded from the lists, i.e. to obtain a ban on obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the violator if the fine is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations.
She also said that these measures can have a devastating effect on the so-called revitalize blogosphere Kenya.
Politicians understand that by making the media silence, they will be able to do whatever they think with impunity.
"Nobody ever learns," wrote journalist Nation Mutum Matthew, describing Kenyan media as a key source of deterrent and equating forces in public life.
"The politicians who themselves will ruin the country and return us to hunt and collect, he wrote.
Kenyan legislators were the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted for the abolition of cuts imposed by the National Commission for Salaries, and the restoration of the size of their huge salary, which constitutes about 522,000 shillings per month tax-free, one of the highest in the world.
Investigators check information about child abuse in Biysk
On October 29, the media reported that a teacher of one of the kindergartens in Biysk for educational purposes locked the child in the basement.
Currently, the investigators find out all the circumstances, as well as legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten employees.
After the accusation of durovkus Yevgeny Vasiliev spoke
Yevgeny Vasilieva, whose person has been focused on the close attention of the media for almost a year, has never commented on numerous publications in the press both about the thefts in the Defense Ministry and about it personally - relations with former Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and about the addiction to valuable things.
However, on November 1, the defendant of the Oboronservis case violated the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilieva said: "Of course, the task was exactly one: to pull out any negative information about the former defense minister."
There was blackmail for what I had to give testimony, otherwise I would be imprisoned.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Next we go to court, we will prove our innocence.
We are 100 percent confident in the victory.
At the same time, we can conclude from the interview that, perhaps, most of all Vasiliev said that she does not care about taste.
Probably, the statement of Vladimir Markin, official representative of the IC of the Russian Federation, that counterfeiting was found in the collection of paintings collected by the defendant of the Oboronservis case.
Among the arrested property there are a number of paintings that the hostess, being confident in his deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art expertise, appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings, found that they have no artistic value and, simply speaking, are cheap counterfeits," Markin said in early October.
Some pictures stolen from the Ministry of Defense...
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from the Defense Ministry, and they said that I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss some personal moments?
In my opinion, it's just an outrage," - says Vasilieva.
At the same time, when asked whether she recognizes her guilt in at least one of the 12 criminal episodes she is charged with, she said: "Naturally, there is no.
There is nothing to admit at all.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation, which is discussed.
Just mislead the people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the RF IC that Vasilyeva evades the study of the materials of the criminal case, the defendant's lawyer said that he and his client "the investigator does not allow him to get acquainted with the materials of the case."
What was the reason for the revelations of Vasiliev, who was under house arrest, who has not yet communicated with the press?
Perhaps how could she not answer the charge of bad taste?
Or is it right for journalists of Komsomolskaya Pravda, who claimed a couple of days ago that she "has fallen into an even greater trance under house arrest" due to the news of Anatoly Serdyukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to the bosom of his family?
Viktor Baranets, a well-known military observer of "KP," wrote in his article "Serdyukov has returned to his wife?" "The investigators do not rule out that after such a shock it may become more talkious in interrogations."
Earlier Vasiliev was charged with illegal sale of real estate of the Defense Ministry.
Juventus" defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the next match of the Italian championship against Parma.
According to Football Italia, the coaching staff decided not to include him in the application for the game to protect before the match of the 4th round of the group round of the Champions League with "Real."
Also will not participate in the match with the "Parma" Lichtsteiner, Vucinic and Pepe.
And forward Fabio Qualarella recovered after an injury and is ready to play.
The British government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic effect for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
HS2 project involves opening high-speed communication with Scotland and North England, with the beginning of the First Stage in 2026
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer noted that the project will unite the UK.
Minister of Transport of Scotland Keth Brown said that he is delighted with the prospect of working on the plan with the British government.
The first stage will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West-Midlands.
When the Second Stage is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and North England from 32.7 to 42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvement of railway capacity and reduce the duration of trips for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the opportunity to overcome the path from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal by HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make the UK and its cities closer to each other.
We develop HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a crisis of throughput in our railway network.
But we are also talking about the transport connection of cities with each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive the best message thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Aleister Carmaicle added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Kit Brown called on Mr. Karmaikla to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "High-speed railway has every chance to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the overall argument for the high-speed railway across the UK.
Therefore, we are pleased to work in partnership with the British government to consider the construction of high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and the continuation of the Glasgow railway line, which is already being planned by the Scottish government.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British ministers next year and joint decision on the next steps.
The U.S. cuts food allowance for the poor
The nutrition benefits for a family of four are reduced by $ 36 per month
On Friday, the US reduces the financial support of food coupons known as "foodsteps," as the action of the relevant state program ends.
For food allowance family of four people will now be allocated $ 36 per month less than before, according to officials.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in 2012 the financial allowance for one person was on average 133 dollars per month.
The cost of food aid in the US rose to $80 billion per year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14% of Americans rely on free food assistance issued by "foodstamps," which has such name since the previous time, when they had the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans in Congress demand further reductions of funds allocated for the program, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others.
Owners of food stores throughout America are worried that reductions will lead to a decrease in consumer spending.
US Congressmen continue to argue about how much more can be reduced funding from the government.
Due to the new rules introduced by the Russian customs, hundreds of trucks have been standing in line for almost a week on the border with Russia.
Today Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install biotoilets
Hundreds of wagons were accumulated at the border crossing points at the entrance to Russia.
This situation arose due to changes in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm: the queue is created by the Russian side, which did not warn about innovations in advance.
From October 28, the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said Deputy Chief of Eastern Customs Vladimir Denisov.
The document of the new model is applied in countries that have joined the International Transportation Convention.
The checkpoints work in reinforced mode.
The correspondent of "FACTS" visited the border and talked with truckers who were hostages of the situation.
Prices in the roadside shop-cafe at the checkpoint "Novoazovsk" grow every day, as well as the queue of wagons.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching about two kilometers.
Customs terminal Novoazovsk - Vesel-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transport destinations from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here cargoes are sent to the Stavropol Territory of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday until midnight, they were still allowed, and after they introduced these rules, - complains trucker Alexei Golovanev (in the photo), who is carrying cargo through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and for almost a week will spend the night in his car.
According to the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment for shipping insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance it is carried on.
Minimum insurance - 4.5 - 5 thousand rubles (about 1100x1300 hryvnia).
Those who go not far (say, Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to $ 50 thousand, pay somewhere 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnia) and pass.
And the rest are stuck - after all, no one has such a lot of money with them!
Imagine, if the driver takes a cargo worth only four thousand dollars, but already in Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnia) to pay for transit!
There are no conditions for survival on the border - no, - complain truckers, arranged there near their cars.
In border shops and cafes and so always expensive, but prices like here, we have not met anywhere!
Sellers oriented and quickly promoted them: 15 hryvnia is a baton, seven hryvnia - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnia - a plate of soup.
And the cafe is one.
And there is no toilet.
In the steppe we sleep, we go to the toilet there.
Neither to wash, nor shave...
I can not leave the car for a week, my wife on the road prepared everything.
A week will stretch, - comforts himself another long-hauler Victor Skotarenko.
Only will the turn reach my car in a week?
What do you have one and a half liters of water? - interested in the only border store.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnia.
What, a bottle of crystal or water insit on silver?
We have a cafe, not a shop.
Take, while there is something else, - parried the seller.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the regional authorities drew attention to the poverty situation of Ukrainian drivers.
The leadership of Amvrosiev and Novoazovsky district administrations were instructed to provide all who are idle in line at the Ukrainian-Russian border, drinking water, - said Acting Chairman of the Donetsk Regional State Administration Sergey Dergunov.
Now ambulance brigades are on duty at checkpoints.
Also for the convenience of people will be installed biotoilets.
According to the official, the problem related to queues will be solved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk Regional State Administration, as of October 31 in the international checkpoints "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk" idle respectively 32 and 68 cars.
"FACTS" will monitor the development of the situation.
Sony expects lower annual profits
Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony, completed the past quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast for profit for the current financial year.
Sony's results for the period from July to September 2013 were more depressing than expected due to the decline in demand for TVs, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's TV business, which in the second quarter brought the company's first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in the first three years, fell again to 9.3 billion yen of operational loss.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through difficult times, especially due to the decrease in demand for TVs.
And while competitors are trying to look for a way out of the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of the main rivals of Sony, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted focus on industrial components: here the company's sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating profit against the expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to the agency Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that this figure will be much higher and will be 221 billion yen.
Aiming to get out of the crisis, Sony expands the product line.
In the middle of this month, the start of sales of "smart" hours from the Japanese corporation, endowed with a number of fashionable features that will get rid of the need for 100 times a day to get out of the pocket smartphone.
After Sony lowered its annual profit and revenue forecast, the company's shares lost more than 11% at the opening of Tokyo's torogs in the morning, dropping to 1668 yen per share.
How many earn the late celebrities - MK in the USA MK
The rating of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was headed by Madonna, who earned 125 million dollars.
But her "overshadowed" the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 amounted to 160 million.
Noticeably lag behind him other deteriorating celebrities, who last year "worked" several times less.
The second in the list of the most "deal" of the outgoing celebrities, compiled by Forbes magazine at the end of the year was Elvis Presley - 55 million per year, and the line below the author of the comics Peanuts Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition to them, the top five included Elizabeth Taylor, who was the leader of the previous year (25 million), and the musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also includes Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
Esser proposes to equate patriotic feelings to extremism
In order to protect the patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults against Russia, Just Russia proposes to equate insulting patriotic feelings to extremist activity and punish for five years in prison.
According to the newspaper "Izvestia," such amendments to the legislation, prepared by Oleg Mikheyev, deputy chairman of the Duma Energy Committee, have already been sent to obtain a conclusion to the Supreme Court and the government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with a country whose citizen he is, characterized by love for this country, responsible attitude to her fate, respect for her history and culture.
According to Mikheyev, in the domestic legislation there are sanctions for abuse of formal signs of state power - flag and coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be affected by both insulting state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, the Russian legislation has not been worked out enough.
As an example, he cites the discussion unfolding annually on the eve of Victory Day, when some media persons allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day May 9 - a real vacchaniya is unfolding annually.
While wit and "alternative view" on history, some publicists come to speculations that, say, how sorry the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I think it is absolutely unacceptable in the country where pride in history remains the main "spirit of the bond" of the nation," Oleg Mikheyev is outraged.
In addition, according to Mikheyev, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and insulting patriotic feelings can be almost impunity.
According to the people's electorate, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activity and to prescribe in Article 282 of the Criminal Code a corresponding punishment.
The draft law provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a 100,000 fine to 5 - summer imprisonment.
In the new compositions of public observation commissions will increase the influence of prisoners
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) may approve new compositions of public observation commissions (UNC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put on voting is adopted, the lobbyists of the security and law enforcement agencies will increase their influence.
ONC - public structures that control the conditions of detention in places of imprisonment.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhaev, the excitement in the penal colony - it is through the ONC that most of the resonant incidents behind bars receive publicity.
The fight between human rights defenders and security law enforcement officers is fighting for control over the UNC.
At the meeting of the working group on the formation of the OOC, I proposed to make the selection criterion of human rights activities.
Valery Borshchev says: "It was not accepted, and formed the lists without developing criteria."
Borshchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Observation Commission and the Association of Independent Observers - the all-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison problems.
As a Duma deputy from Yabloko, he developed a law regulating the activities of the UNC.
The OP Board should vote for the composition of the UNC in 43 regions of the country.
Less than a thousand people claim 1800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria contests were not organized due to the lack of candidates.
OP promises to organize a donboard on vacant places.
The Moscow People's Assembly is one of the few commissions with the contest, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants in the new composition instead of 20.
According to Borshchev, in the current composition of the capital commission 11 human rights defenders and 9 security agencies, and in the version, which is in the OP voting, the ratio is changed by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights activists wanted to enter the capital commission.
But Vyacheslav Kalinin, representative of the Combat Brotherhood, may be re-entered into the new composition.
He was a member of the OOC for three years, but never visited the prisoners.
Borshchev believes that the security and law enforcement agencies, having appointed their chairman of the UNC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights activists do not exclude a collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their opinion, the promotion of the security and law enforcement agencies is coordinated by a member of the UNC Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the Russian Officers, an organization that defends the interests of security agencies.
"I do not have babies in the head of the tractor," said RBC Daily Anton Tsvetkov.
He denies that he is lobbying for the promotion of any lists and says he is not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested oppositionists.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in what list they are voting for in the EP.
He considers the publication of Borshchev's information as a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chelyabinsk OOC.
Its former leaders will be removed because of last year's spear upheavals.
The Public Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of the prisoners.
But the ONK Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to security forces.
The new lists "disabled" the human rights activist-chairman of the local commission, but turned out to be one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013, the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for unethical behavior.
The list of the Moscow and Rostov commissions is considered by Borshchev as "a place for Kopeisk."
Nadezhda Tolokonnikova's revelations did not affect the People's Assembly of Mordovia, which is considered "force": only one human rights activist wanted to get into the new composition, and she did not even accept the documents for the competition.
Member of the OP Board Nikolai Svanidze told RBC Daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to other members of the council.
His colleague in OP Pavel Gusev says that he voted for, as he likes the proposed Moscow list.
He coordinated the compilation of lists of the UNC deputy secretary Vladislav Grib, who is also an employee of the Research Institute of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia.
RBC Daily told RBC Daily that it is not right to divide candidates into human rights defenders and siloviki and disagrees with the fact that the chairmen of the commissions have enough powers to prevent the work of its members.
Mushroom is not going to predict the results of voting by the Council of EP.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a modified version will be voted in the coming days.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of parental leave.
Billionaire Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining tycoon, which has an unresolved dispute on the payment of carbon tax of $6 million, made this statement at the time when he tried to brush off the questions about whether he has a conflict.
The combined Palmer Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in making a decision to abolish carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that the conflict of interest could only be with the ministers, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughter would personally benefit from political measures.
"He has a major conflict of interests when it comes to a paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they will receive a vacation or no, said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the election commission officially declared Palmer the winner in the struggle for the place of the Sunsine-Cost electoral district Fairfax with a margin of 53 votes after the vote recount.
Palmer called for a review of the vote counting procedure to speed up the process.
Daughters Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should the decision on these elections be made two months after we voted?
"We need to have a more advanced system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have such a system to come, enter your data into the computer, vote immediately and get a result at 18:30 in the same evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for marks in the bulletins.
This is because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
Using a pencil in our time seems strange.
The election commission is studying the possibilities for electronic voting and recently published a joint discussion document with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his program includes the international airport for Sunsayin-Cost and he will take his new work very seriously.
The state office presupposes the service of society.
We do not achieve any rewards, except the gratitude of history, for the fact that at a critical moment we can serve this district," he said.
Against companies Google, Samsung, Huawei filed lawsuits for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the price of which it interrupted at the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel's $4.5 billion patents, filed a lawsuit for infringement of patent rights in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help to compare key words of search on the Internet with the appropriate advertising, says the claim, which is the basis of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not give any comments.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones running on the Android operating system from Google, which fiercely competes with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered for Nortel patents the initial price of $900 million.
Google has raised the offered price several times, ultimately offering as much as $4.4 billion.
Losing the Nortel Rockstar consortium patent case, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in this transaction the determining factor was the Motorola patent library.
"Despite an unsuccessful attempt to acquire at auction patents that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them," - said in a lawsuit.
Rockstar requires increased compensation for losses from Google, as it claims that infringement of patent rights by Google is intentional, according to the claim.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22 thousand spectators, the police noted, who attended today's meeting of the Committee of the Committee of the Russian Federation.
The ticket program is overstated, in their opinion, about twice.
During the match of the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup with "Spartak" was involved only a thousand stewards under the norm of nine thousand.
Spartak fans relied 2,200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, however, according to an agreement with the Moscow club, they sold 5,000 tickets.
This data was announced by the head of the KDC Arthur Grigoryants.
The bird, thrown by air to a safe place from the drilling rig in the North Sea, released back into the wild
The bird, thrown by air to shore after it was found in a deplen state on the oil outings in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
This water pad was placed in the helicopter, which was headed to Aberdeen last month, and then it was released by the Scottish Department of the Society for the Prevention of Animal Violence (SPCA) in the Rescue Center in Alloa.
Center manager Colin Seddon said: "This water pastour is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe, who got into the zone of strong winds over the North Sea.
It seems that the bird was exhausted and was able to find a refuge in the oil outing.
He added: "She was not able to fly again, so they asked us for help.
The water stoon was healthy and in good condition by the time it was released.
Fines for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will grow at times
According to the city authorities, the increase in the size of fines will help to restore order in Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street traders do not pay taxes, products they implement, often do not pass the ratio of sanitary control.
This means that the health of the vologzhan is jeopardized.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, the press service of the Administration of Vologda.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford automobile plant in Vsevolozhsk.
According to the trade unions, all dismissed received compensation.
However, the issue of reducing industrial production in the region arises more acutely than the workers' problems.
Deputy of the regional Zacsa Alexey Etmanov said at the meeting that at the plant of the company "Ford" in Vsevolozhsk reduced about 600 people.
According to him, this happened in September: then about 600 people left the plant under the voluntary dismissal program, which was developed together with the organization's trade union.
Workers who decided to quit their own will were offered "golden parachutes" in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority left jobs at their own will.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is a whole night shift.
I think this will not be limited.
However, in the next two years the authorities do not plan to accept any programs to support regional enterprises in a difficult situation," he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and a large reduction of jobs.
In Ford, this information is not denied or confirmed.
We are waiting for the response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will publish it.
Talks about the reduction of workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company plans to dismiss 600 people became known in September.
Previously, the plant announced the suspension of production of cars.
The plant was the reason for the decline in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrosta, the volume of industrial production in the Leningrad region decreased by 5.4% following the results of nine months of 2013.
Production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth rate is insufficient for state development
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the pace of GDP to be insufficient for Russia and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the conditions of business crediting and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
This year we planned a growth of GDP around 3%, maybe even a little more.
Really it will be a little less than 2%.
Against the background of a recession in a number of European countries, it seems not very bad, but for us it is not enough, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there should be higher rates.
Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian businesses receive normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing to do," the head of the government said.
Director of "Ugra" Andrey Belmach noted that it is difficult to say how much time it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place just a few hours ago, so to say how much time it will take to look for a new coach, I am not ready, - cited ITAR-TASS words Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We study all possible options.
The priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I do not just want to find some coach, but a person who will work in our club for several years and achieve certain results with him.
Snowboarder for the Olympic bill specially photographed
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, where this winter the Olympic Games will be held.
The banknotes are commemorated - 100 rubles.
But in the network bloggers are already actively ironizing about the memorable banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on October 30, they drew attention to the fact that the image of a snowboarder with banknotes can be found in photo banks.
In particular - in the free storage photo StockExchange, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in the Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megaobzor on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in advertising smartphones RugGear.
The Olympic banknote is made in blue and blue.
On the one hand, a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other - the view of the Olympic stadium and the Heat-bird.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuyev, who won the competition among students of the Repin Academy of Arts of St. Petersburg.
At the presentation, it was noted that several sports were considered - ski, freestyle and jumping from the springboard, but eventually chose snowboard, because it is a relatively young sport.
According to the source of "Izvestia," close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the opinion of the public regarding the wide spread of the image of a snowboarder with the Olympic banknote and now is studying the situation.
But in Goznak is not too concerned about the hype around the Olympic banknote.
Head of the press service of the State Sign Natalia Nikiforova told "Izvestia," that all the reasoning about plagiarism is ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote will turn to the right, in the photos in the network - to the left, - said Nikiforov.
A person in a photo shoot to create a bill was removed from different points, then the final image was chosen, on it - a characteristic zaiznoboardist.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist received a salary for work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is quite positive.
The recognition of the image on the bill - a plus for its promotion, - says the executive director of NP "RusBrend" Alexey Popovichev.
To prove a hundred percent similarity of images on the bill and in photo banks is quite difficult, so the claim to challenge intellectual property on this image is unlikely to arrive.
For the first time, the Olympic banknote appeared in China - for the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 was issued a commemorative banknote of 10 yuan.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.

NSA blames the internal error, not hackers in the termination of the site
The secret National Security Agency announced on Friday evening that the termination of their website for several hours caused a technical failure, not hackers, as stated in the network.
"NSA.gov has been inaccessible within a few hours tonight due to the internal error that occurred during the planned update," the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The statements that the work fail was caused by a distributed attack type denial in service [DDoS], incorrect.
Earlier this evening, the server monitoring online system registered that the NSA site did not work for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, the NSA representative reported ABC News that the internal secret network of the agency was not hacked.
No classified information is in danger, said the representative.
At least one online group of hackers-activists said that it is responsible for failing the NSA site with the help of DDoS-attack.
DDoS-attacks are designed to overlapping the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site fails.
Hacker tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not intended for penetration into the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the super-secret NSA, which once received the nickname "No such Agency," turned out to be in the center of public attention and fierce criticism after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and inside the country - all this is a reaction to the secret files of the NSA, stolen from the agency and published by the disappointed former employee of the NSA Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the agency caused a ticked that today's incident was the result of targeted actions of hackers.
The head of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The launch of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
"Today there was a landmark event: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the gas pipeline "South Stream," the largest and most important project in Europe, "Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream is intended for diversification of export routes of Russia through Europe.
The dispute under the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which contains most of the gas intended for Europe in Russia, increases the risk level for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said that the direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated forevery.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts working in 2015.
Gazprom said that the construction should begin in other countries located further along the route of the gas pipeline, by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Rosbalt Agency Deprived Media Status for Slander
On October 31, the Moscow City Court decided to invalidate the license on registration of the Rosbalt agency, - writes "Lenta."
Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of media status - for systematic and gross violations of the media law.
In the course of the trial an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact refusing to issue the newspaper the right to propose counterarguments.
What is Rosbalt
CJSC Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened the second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
The agency also has representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications was (and still make up) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the proximity of the publication to the security agencies continued throughout the existence of the agency.
Along with the fact that "Rosbalt" had a vast base of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions said the fact that Natalia Chaplin - the wife of Victor Cherkesov - was at the head of the project.
At the same time, Chaplin's role in the management of Rosbalt is not completely clear: most often it is called "the project manager."
The agency's general director is Larisa Afonina, editor-in-chief is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt has not appeared in the ratings of the federal media - neither citation nor the audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the attendance rating of Russian media sites according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the past five months - notes about the Kremlin's helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group "King and Joke," pogroms in the capital Biryulev.
Rosbalt's conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law came into force that banned journalists from obscene abuse.
The agency found the banned vocabulary in two videos published on the agency's website ("Jigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot defiled oil towers").
Further sides are described in different ways.
Roskomnadzor, based on the discovered videos, accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violation of the media law and appealed to the court with a request to withdraw the license from the agency.
Rosbalt stated that the agency's claims were inappropriate: firstly, the videos were not editorial materials, and secondly, their mother's words were disguised, and, thirdly, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed Roskomnadzor's complaints in the world court - and when on October 22, 2013 the Moscow City Court accepted Roskomnadzor's claim, the consideration of these complaints was still continued.
However, the judge made a decision not in favor of Rosbalt on the 25th day of the world: editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offenses and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the Moscow City Court hearing - if we give up the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to invalidate the certificate of registration of Rosbalt, in fact depriving the agency of the status of media.
It is impossible to say that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The agency was supported by Duma deputies (the statement addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 was signed by 26 deputies; the document was submitted on the initiative of the CPRF).
Head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, Chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and Head of the Presidential Human Rights Council Mikhail Fedotov said about the inappropriateness of the publication.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, Roskomnadzor's leadership even provided him with some guarantees that the license will not be revoked.
The Rosbalt trial showed that under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be a media outlet in Russia today is a big question.
Gen's speech turned out to be a stimulant of the formation of Sinapse
Scientists from the University of John Hopkins and the Medical School of Mount Sinai discovered a squirrel that "gene" Foxp2 performs its function, stimulating the formation of new ties between neurons.
The research was published in Science, on the website of the journal you can read its summary.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known genome whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes even did not understand each other themselves.
Scientists found that family members had broken the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function was not known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their functions Foxp2 performs as a stimulant of the formation of new sinaps in the field of brain related to the formation of speech.
This is done by the other gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of finding factors that stimulate the formation of sinaps.
SRPX2 turned out to be one of the 10 such genes found by the authors, with only its activity Foxp2.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vocals, scientists have confirmed in the experiment on mice.
When animal activity of the gene was artificially reduced, they were less screaming when separated from their mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of sounds is restored.
Earlier, the mouse also showed a connection with the vocalization of Foxp2.
Animals, who introduced a human copy of the gene, foodd more active and at a lower frequency than conventional mouse.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, controlled by him SRPX2 with purely "mechanical" properties of sound formation or more subtle processes.
Ponomarev left Just Russia
Ilya Ponomarev, deputy of the State Duma of the Just Russia party, a member of its branch in Novosibirsk, filed a statement on withdrawal from the political organization.
According to the MP, he submitted a statement to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to her statute, this automatically means that Ponomarev left the ranks of "righteous."
We sit, drink tea...
"For some reason, many people want to see the picture "Ilia Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table," but there is nothing so epochal," the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the "Esters."
Meanwhile, Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to give up his mandate as Duma deputy.
He explained that despite his withdrawal from the party, he remains a member of the faction and cannot get out of it according to the law.
Reports about Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave Just Russia appeared on October 30.
It was reported that Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov would leave the SSR together with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Do you want a frozen ice cream in the dark?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first glowing ice cream in the dark with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came to this idea by reading a scientific article about jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
The snow can react with the language of the one who eats it, raising the pH level in the protein and forcing it to glow.
Chris says that since the ice cream begins to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lizni me, I'm delicious," says: "This is an incredible thing, but still at the very beginning, if we talk about production, so for about 200 you get about 2 g of substance.
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue in neutral pH.
So when your mouth heats the protein, it will increase the level of pH and the ice cream will begin to glow.
We tested it for the last few months, and it seemed that it would be perfect to present it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
This may be the most expensive ice cream of what I did, because the luminnesca of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So every ball costs me about .140.
But it is quite pleasant to taste.
The experimental company Charlie, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of gold leaf.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I am very much want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is by definition impossible because of the refactation caused by ice crystals, which consists of ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
GM withdraws a number of new pickups in the U.S. to refine the backs of the seats
General Motors Co recalls almost 19,000 brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra models in 2014 to eliminate problems with manual seat tilt adjustment, according to a notice submitted on Friday from the U.S. regulatory authorities in the field of vehicle safety.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the backrest tilt mechanism.
As a result, the seat back does not meet the federal standards of road safety under the headrests.
"When hitting the car behind the headrest can not properly protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury, said in the website of the National Traffic Safety Administration notification.
The insulated models were manufactured in the period from August 1 to September 10.
GM pickups began in June and is the most important launch of the car in series production for the leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM reported to pickup owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The National Traffic Safety Administration could not consider the notification to the owners due to the 16-day termination of the government's work, which reduced the growth of car sales in October.
Silverado and Sierra pickup sales, upgraded for the 2014 model range, increased by about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 pickup Sierra.
GM's shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.

Snowden is ready to co-cooperate with Germany in the issue of US intelligence
Edward Snowden, U.S. intelligence exposer, said he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander will not be able to answer questions about his activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Strbele met Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his dacha in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, which the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, it was said: "Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements by criminal charges that do not give any protection.
However, to tell the truth is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believes that the support of the international community can convince the U.S. government to give up criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, said Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible.
The relations between the United States and Germany became tense after the statement that the NSA listened to Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who heads the parliamentary group in charge of intelligence, said that if there is an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, he was in danger and without destroying his relationship with the United States, it should be used.
Mr. Striebele, a member of the parliament of the Green Germany Party, published his photo with Mr. Snowden on Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Striebele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contract serviceman, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had given testimony in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be there, said the MP.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had encountered a scoon and a constant campaign of persecution, which forced him to leave his house.
However, he said that he was inspired by the world's reaction to the political statements.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials, including in the United States, considered the exposure of an uncontrolled system of all-theirable surveillance useful for society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities, and when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved.
Foreign workers on subclass 457 visas can be tested on the authenticity "
The test of authenticity for foreign workers on visas class 457 is under consideration of the government, as it is planned to expand the repressive measures.
This test, in the event of its adoption, will be applied according to the criteria aimed at preventing the use of visas of class 457 to fill in unqualified positions or as a back door to move family and friends to Australia.
The document presented by the government for discussion was published today, while former Labor MP Maxine McQueen criticized the government's rhetoric regarding foreign workers, saying that it could offend the neighbors of Australia.
"The loud statements of the type "foreigners at the end of the queue" and "first work for Australians" are a very unpleasant rollback to the times when the trade unions demanded a protected labor market, "said the Institute of "Australia" India today.
Historically, this meant that it was the white work that had to be defended, and if some in the region saw the echoes of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The document presented for discussion presents 12 measures, which were previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka, where he meets with officials about the smuggling of people, has already made five of the recommended changes, and the rest are under consideration.
If the criteria are accepted, the applicant for a visa can be examined for whether the candidate is genuine in conditions when the candidate is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or person concerned with the financing of the company.
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of holders of subclass visas 457, because earlier the enterprises intending to sponsor a small number of employees, then took to work hundreds.
Meanwhile, the 35-year-old shri-lankey, asylum seeker, died presumably from a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees to the island of Christmas this week.
The nine-year-old son of this man, who had been killed by grief, accompanied him on his way to Australia, and from the moment of his father's death on Wednesday he was supported by a cousin who was also aboard the ship.
The Australian authorities hastily sent a man to the hospital of the Christmas Island where he died.
Head coach of "Colorado" Patrick Roy, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semyon Varlamov from the first minutes of Friday match with "Dallas," expressed confidence that the recent night behind the bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas sobkor "SE" Natalia Shmelyeva.
And what should we expect," said Roy after the morning rolling, "Avalanche."
Of course, what has happened bothers us all, but we are confident in it and feel that it will be useful for him to come out on ice today.
We want him to go to the ice and show his usual level.
That is, you are completely sure that the situation has not affected the condition of the goalkeeper?
That's what we'd see today.
Undoubtedly, our players will support Varley by helping him protect the goal, as it was in the previous matches of this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to draw any conclusions until the court understands this situation.
Baumgertner nominated for Uralkali Board of Directors
The current Board of Directors of Uralkali OJSC proposed the candidacy of Vladislav Baumgertner, the new Board of Director General Vladislav Baumgertner, who was arrested in Minsk.
Bamugertner was included in the list of 11 people nominated for the new Board of Directors.
This list was prepared for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on November 29, at which a new composition of the Board of Directors will be determined by voting.
Currently, Baumgertner is under house arrest in Minsk.
When arrested in August this year, he was charged with abuse of official power.
However, later Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said at a press conference that Baumgertner's accusations were retrained for "theft."
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of Russia's economic pressure
The European Union has a reserve plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating a stand-by loan, while another EU official directly involved in the negotiations has been underway, adding that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can get 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Reuters" analysts doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements on the terms of financing.
The international rating agency S&P, which lowered Ukraine's sovereign rating rating by one notch to the B-" from B-" on Friday, does not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary for receiving assistance.
However, EU representatives say that the IMF can be flexible in lending conditions, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the plan of financial support of the country, the EU has a reserve option to provide Ukraine with gas, the overwhelming part of which is now coming from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from the "Nord Stream" or reversal from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia "isisolating" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reversible supplies to Ukraine can be used only for a few weeks, and will probably lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
"Between EU and Ukrainians are negotiating how to create favorable conditions, so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," Reuters added.

Americans listened to Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, one of the U.S. special services, who preferred not to disclose his name, said that the United States listened to telephone conversations of high-ranking officials of Japan.
This man confirmed that in the country of the rising sun there are several points designed to listen.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct reconnaissance against each other.
According to him, this happened during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite the allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are objects for intelligence activities, NHK said.
Officially none of the parties has not commented on this information yet.
Recall that the news about the surveillance of the U.S. intelligence services for the Chancellor of Germany appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA could listen to Merkel's phone over the past ten years.
According to some reports, the Chancellor himself received the news of his hearing very painfully.
She said that the allies, in her opinion, are Germany and the United States for decades, such observation of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share the details of the wiretapping of telephone conversations between Angela Merkel and the German prosecutor's office.
The German specially flew to Moscow to meet with a former CIA officer.
Scandal video got into the police
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly reckless tricks, caught on smoking a sack.
Police of the Canadian city said that it has a video and is ready to launch an investigation against the mayor.
He said that his post will not leave, reports CNN.
The information that the authorities have evidence of the use of drugs by Rob Ford, appeared on the website of the Toronto police.
The head of the local law enforcement, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this occasion.
Sheriff said that he was not authorized to share these footage with the public, but he is sufficiency for their existence.
According to Blair, the compromising Rob Ford video was found during the drug raid conducted by the guards in the summer of 2013.
Previously, the Canadian press has already written about the existence of this video, but until recently there were no confirmations.
The mayor himself does not give any comments on this.
He only says that he is not guilty of anything and is not going to resign.
The video discovered by the police is one of the evidences in the case of 35-year-old friend Ford Alexander Lisi, who is accused of trading light drugs, extortion, illegal income, as well as criminal collusion.
Sometimes Lisi performed the functions of Rob Ford's driver.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in the public in a drunken form, allowed himself racist and sexist statements.

Earthquake 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, near the city of Cokimbo in the central part of Chile, reports the agency Reuters.
The dome of the earthquake was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers south-west of the city, specified on the website of the U.S. Geological Service (USGS).
Mouls were fixed at 20:03 local time (3:03 November 1 in Moscow).
Nothing has yet been reported about the victims or about the destructions caused by underground shocks.
Recall that Chile is in one of the most seismic areas of the Earth, so the earthquakes of different forces there are not uncommon.
One of the most serious happened in 2010.
Then the earthquake 8.8 magnitude and the tsunami caused by it led to the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, in Chile there was the most powerful earthquake in the modern history: in 1960, there were recorded a 9.5 magnet.
As a result of that natural disaster killed more than five thousand people.
JSC "Rostovaeroinvest" recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the choice of the general designer of the facility.
The sum of the contract in "RostovAeroinvest" is not disclosed.
According to the press service of OAO, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, under the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent to state expertise in the spring of 2014.
The winner will have to design a new passenger terminal of the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and elements of improvement of the airport complex.
At the first stage of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50 thousand square meters, in the future it is possible to increase it.
According to "Rostovaerinvest," the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
By the time of summing up the tender, the architectural concept of the Yuzhny airport complex was determined, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The main terminal building is designed by the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in the implementation of major projects, the company designed terminals C and E terminals Sheremetyevo International Airport and a new airport complex at the international airport "Knevichi" in Vladivostok.
Yuzhny International Airport Complex will be built in Aksai district of Rostov region and will replace the current Rostov airport, which will be closed and in the future integrated into urban development.
The construction of the air terminal complex is scheduled for 2014, the commissioning of all facilities - for 2017.
Italian workers with experience give way to young people
Italian unemployment breaks records.
The data published on Wednesday showed that now 12.5% of the population is working.
So bad things have not happened since the Second World War.
Among the young, this figure is higher several times.
40.4% of residents aged 15 to 24 years have no employment.
In the opinion of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of senior employees.
Such an experiment is already carried out by the country's largest energy company, and the adopted laws allow the regional authorities to provide a part of the early pension for employees with experience.
On the other hand, Italy is waiting for the problem of the aging population common for Europe.
And economists are not sure that the idea of premature rotation of personnel will justify itself.
Syria has destroyed chemical weapons equipment
Syria has destroyed all the declared capacity for the production of chemical weapons, recognized the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first stage of disarmament of Damascus completed the day before the deadline.
Until November 1, Syria was supposed to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare combat poisonous substances for use, BBC reports.
The destruction of the stocks of poisonous substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the OPCW representative, currently the poisonous substances are in sealed repositories.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed during a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21 during a chemical attack.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - in order not to allow the Syrian authorities to produce more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition equipment.
These production capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent their repairs.
The next veha is the middle of November: by this time the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy the existing stocks of poisonous substances.
There are many questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by the Western intelligence services.
They will willingly advise the inspectors new objects to check if they suspect that Damascus is not completely frank.
The U.S. believes that this shelling was conducted by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is a work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded from the Syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement reached through the mediation of Russia - to destroy or disable all the capacities for the production of shells, poisoning gases and liquids and to fill the projectiles with these substances.
Now that this stage has passed, the next step should be the destruction of chemical weapons already available in the Syrian army.
It is assumed that in this arsenal there can be more than 1000 tons of nerve-paralytic poisoning substances, sebum-slab mustard gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozens of different places.
For its destruction, it is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities begin to agree on the schedule of action - it takes two weeks.
Head of field operations OPCW Jerry Smith said BBC that his inspectors "personally monitored the destruction of equipment."
"They are now not able to continue producing or mixing chemical weapons," he said.
The OPCW statement says that the inspectors visited 21 of 23 objects in Syria and were convinced that the plants for the production of shells and poisonous substances were either destroyed or brought into dissusability.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out inspection there, the document says, but the equipment was transported and checked by OPCW specialists from there.
According to Smith, the process of destruction of chemical weapons infrastructure was "especially difficult," as it had to work in the conditions of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, however, Smith said that the time to celebrate this with inspectors has not yet been found - they were too busy with work.
George Kerevan: the gap with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the European free movement zone as a condition of membership in the EU.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Bervik and the border with barbed wire along Adrianov ram.
However, Strathclyde pointed to possible economic benefits from more free movements in the rest of Europe, although predictable - this did not appear in the headlines.
No one has also pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time turning their formal rules as they are comfortable.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continuation of non-compliance with the requirements will be a cheap concession to Brussels in exchange for what he really wanted from the Scots.
So it's a story that doesn't deserve attention.
And so old that it became a name: for the first time I heard the kid, that the independence means passport control, at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment, lost during the retlying of an ancient fairy tale.
Why should independent Scotland fulfill European orders at all?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here are the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the European crisis, the project "Europe" is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, the parties that oppose the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party - the alternative for Germany - founded only this year - appeared from nowhere and received almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially supplanting the Free Democrats (the analogue of our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan for the creation of federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The saving measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shekel imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency, led many people to the idea that the project "Europe has gone too far."
The euro crisis is little due to the fact that national governments are working with excessive budget deficits, which was true only for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates advantageous for German exporters, which German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe finds itself in a pre-funable position on production capabilities in comparison with Germany.
The only saving agent is to cut wages and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current problems of the budget and currency is a deeper problem of productive abilities in Europe.
As a result of a set of green energy measures introduced by Brussels, the cipher, which means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, the European industry pays twice as much electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States.
This is paralyzed unfavorable price conditions, as we have already seen in Grainjum.
No wage freezing in the world will stop the crushing victory of the cheap US shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, revolt is ripe, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on the same level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the ruined economy of France in distress.
The right-wing party against the EU, Marine Le Pen, has just won the decisive additional elections, having dropped the ruling party of socialists to the third place.
"Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to British laborers that it is impossible to assume that the split among the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with his new-invented popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If this is very likely the parties against the EU will receive support in these elections, such a bloc will be able to take the dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
Here is my opinion: the growing moods against the EU and against a single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become a sort of vague "Europe) nations, which liked General de Gaulle.
Germany and its several economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that the UK is distanced from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific Ocean indicates the likelihood that the UK will remain unattended in the cold of the Atlantic.
In what position does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of Small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, to send Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed within the framework of a more free European agreement provided that we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-Federal Europe nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repetition of Norway's experience and preservation of our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party's government in Scotland is, strangely enough, the most successful political movement in Europe, against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority of votes in 2011 due to objections to the reductions of expenditures proposed (and implemented) by the ruler of the Treasury ruler Aleister Darling and the subsequent coalition of the tori and liberal democrats.
Scotland would now be ridiculous to vote for independence only in order to take austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Australian woman appeals against prison term in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days of prison on Phuket Island for false assertion that she was attacked by a taxi driver, filed an appeal for the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevy Rochelle Bamford was originally recognized as the Phuket Provincial Court guilty of suing a false claim after the Thai police report that a local taxi driver attacked on Sunday night on June 10, while two other men held it.
However, according to the recordings of CCTV cameras later it turned out that she safely returned to her hotel after breaking relations with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed that she had fabricated the story.
Before the trial it was kept in local police cameras.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in the center of general regime's detention on the outskirts of Phuketa, not in a women's prison for adults.
She is the daughter of the former Australian League player Peter Tanx, who appealed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanx said the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was concerned about the well-being of her daughter and waited for her return to Australia.
"It is obvious that it was an alarming time, but we hope that it will safely return home as soon as possible," said Tanx.
Bamford filed an appeal for her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her vacation in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal may lead to the fact that the court will increase its sentence for up to two years and will force her to serve in prison for adults.
However, after the recent killing of the Australian travel agent Michel Smith in Phuket Thailand can also seek to restore its undermined tourist image, which will lead to acquittal.

Driving schools will be able to conduct exams for a driver's license
Examinations for driving license will be able to receive private companies with their own computerized autodrome.
Kommersant reports about this with reference to the draft resolution of the government "On admission to the management of vehicles."
According to the newspaper, currently there are only about 30 such autodromes in Russia.
It is assumed that students of such "privileged" driving schools will count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Automobile Inspectorate will monitor the exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theory exams and more than 20% of the site students do not pass from the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for the autodromes contained in the draft resolution of the government come into force on November 5, 2014.
The project also contains the requirements for training in the driving of two-wheeled equipment.
From January 1, 2015, motorcycle owners to obtain the rights of category A will have to take an exam in the conditions of the city movement.
In addition, since May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire drivers of foreigners with foreign rights.
Such employees will have to receive Russian rights after passing the exam.
Early puberty: aging earlier
Afra-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close
No evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame
Experts believe that obesity epidemic can be one of the launch mechanisms of early puberty
The tendency to early puberty is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Eterij is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should the mother be frightened if her daughter begins to form the germ of the breast and grow pubic hair in 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, children's endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
"I spend a long time, calming my parents - usually this does not mean a quick onset of full puberty," said Kaplovitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubquefty and abseed hair and the smell of the body, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (the first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and decreased from 12.75 in 1970.
"After the breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two or three years to the menarkhe," said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of the book "Ranner's puberty in girls: how to cope with this common problem."
Time is the most accurate check of how puberty will progress.
There is a discussion about what is the actual onset of puberty, but is considered premature, when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - this is what a pediatrician can monitor carefully.
Faster progression can serve as a basis for tests in an endocrinologist to eliminate serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which ultimately can lead to slower growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplitz is cautious with medicines, but admits that the suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they differ from peers.
Another big problem is clear: parents just do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will deal with hygiene," said Kaplovitz.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman, whose daughter menstruation began at 10 years.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from the school scared and upset by the fact that she was the first among her friends.
There are many advertised theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys - as in girls - puberty comes earlier.
Kaplitz claims that the premise that has the greatest weight is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to study girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects the amount of body fat with puberty.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other conducive factors.
In this country, African American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are different explanations.
All over the world, the early puberty seems to be affected by everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys have hair on the face and on the pub with a younger age, the tendency to complete early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The appearance of pimples and pubelkovy hair occurs even in infants and nursery children.
"We must be careful about how we determine the true onset of puberty," said Mr. Lawrence Silverman, a children's endocrinologist at the Goreib Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be embarrassed to receive instructions from the pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
This could mean earlier than expected, the conversation," explained Kaplitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who bloom early need to confirm that even when it happens before, this process is a normal part of life.
Head of Dagestan heard in the anthem of Kuban a note of extremism
The football match between "Anji" and "Kuban" was in a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar region and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the anthem of Kuban sounded differently.
On Thursday, the head of Dagestan, Ramazan Abdulatipov, proposed to the republican parliamentarians to appeal to the court, because the Krasnodar Territory's anthem allegedly gives calls for ethnic hatred, in particular, calling for a war with the "basurmans."
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory, it is in our time in 1995 approved this hymn.
This is a shame, and no one is engaged in it.
"You remember here as a mother of your native, on the enemy, on the bassurmanin we go to the mortal battle" - for which such words are recorded in the anthem, poison some believers on other believers," - expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov, Chairman of the Parliament Khizri Shikhsaidov.
RBS removes two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily suspended two traders in its currency transaction division, according to the information of two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that the global audit by regulators of the alleged currency market manipulation is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in investigations related to the world's largest financial market, the daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended during the ongoing investigation, which echoes the scandal associated with the manipulation of the interbank LIBOR rate.
Refusing to comment on the dismissal, the bank confirmed that this month he received requests for information from regulatory authorities.
Our current investigation of this issue continues, and we fully cooperate with FCA and other regulators, - reported in the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the knowledgeable persons said that RBS transmitted email and instant messages that received and sent it to the former trader regulating the UK. Financial Control (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left the RBS in 2010 and, as far as is known, he was given a vacation to his current position as the head of European spot currency trading in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from the Standard Chartered bank this week.
None of these traders were accused of any violations.
The instant messaging group of Mr. Asher included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed individuals.
The UBS bank reported this week that it took action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said that it is investigating the alleged currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulatory bodies in the world - European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and Hong Kong's Curty Authority, consider claims that the bankers have entered into a conspiracy to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal inspections or received requests for information from regulatory authorities, said the persons familiar with the situation.
Banks review instant messages and emails in a few years in search of cases of offenses.
The news about the audits stirred traders in the field of activity, which has been one of the largest sources of income of trade divisions of investment banks, which this year, however, faced difficulties due to the fact that the low volatility of currencies reduces favorable opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation, saying that the vast and highly liquid currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading in the foreign exchange market, fragmentation of liquidity between various trading platforms and the wider use of the banks of their internal platforms means that you can start to influence the market for a very small price.
This news came on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that it dismissed one of the traders of its London Stock Exchange division this week, after it caused losses of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue has managed to localize," Credit Suisse reported.

The court also upheld the other sections of this 2700-page law and further ruled that the requirement of the Health Act to ensure that the states would increase the compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid program, otherwise they would lose all the federal funding of the Medicaid program, is not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit for blocking the bill was submitted by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
Each of the main republican presidential candidates during the season of the primary elections of 2012, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney, resolutely opposed the law.

Only 7% of respondents "really negative" belong to the Russian Marches, and 19% are "rather negative."
Another 35% failed to formulate their attitude towards the action.
This year, the Moscow City Hall agreed to hold the Russian March with up to 15,000 people in Lyublino, which was announced today by the head of the security department of the capital Alexey Majorov.
This nationalist action has been held every year on the Day of National Unity since 2005.

Now only every fifth Russian (20%) knows about this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 almost a third of citizens (31%) heard about the Russian Marches.
Let us recall that three years ago, on December 11, a spontaneous nationalist rally was held on Manezhnaya Square, which grew into mass riots.
The Levada Center also asked the Russians what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (Day of National Unity) increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of citizens gather to celebrate this holiday.
Approximately the same number (17%) intend to celebrate November 7 Day of the October Revolution.
Most citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.

Today, it is important for the population not the number of medical institutions and their status, but the quality of medical care.
Implementation of the program "Modernization of health care of the Tula region for 2011 - 2013," the reorganization of medical institutions of our city will create an optimal structure of medical care to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant women and women.

Venezuela will set a currency rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency - a bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported on November 1 by the agency Bloomberg citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed for a year to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand US dollars.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the acquired in the country of bolivarov at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be set later.
In February, Karakas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivar per dollar.
However, on the black market one dollar is estimated at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
On October 18, Oil Industry Minister and Vice President for Economy Rafael Ramailez said that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial reports, which led the agency, Karakas may still decide to reduce the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of deterring prices for products and consumer goods, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to a deficit of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media wrote that Venezuela noted the lack of toilet paper.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented confession that the US espionage has come in an inconsient far away.
John Kerry demonstrated the easing of the US tracking tactics, making unprecedented recognition that in some cases US espionage came unsuitable far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, that he was an autopilot during the appearance of high-pronounce Edward Snowden's spying activities of the NSA.
These leaks of information put the US government in the center of the diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video communication at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, actually perceived some of the things happening on the autopilot, because such an opportunity already existed during the Second World War, and in the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, on September 11.
Then he became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government, who admitted that the US espionage went too far, but stressed that no one's rights were violated.
He said: "In some cases it has gone unsuitable far away.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain to people, and now conducts a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a feeling of abuse.
I assure you, there are no abuses against innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted out of good motives and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: We work in a new world where people are ready to explode themselves.
There is a radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, explode people and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented the crash of aircraft, the explosions of buildings and the killing of people, because we were able to learn about these plans in advance.
Meanwhile, American legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to the alleged US espionage abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the United States, said the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on Thursday.
Connectica Senator Chris Murphy said he had talks with members of the European Parliament and other persons this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to disappointment with the surveillance carried out by the National Security Agency.
"For the interests of the national security of the United States, it is really important that Europeans remain our supporters in relation to our common anti-terrorist efforts," said democrat Murphy, who is the chairman of the sub-committee of international relations of the Senate on European affairs, in an interview with Washington.
I'm going to Europe to make it clear to them that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger about these NSA programs.
The news that the NSA collected millions of phone conversations in Europe worsened relations with some US allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies gathered and which they shared with the United States.
Other revelations were cited by Snowden's documents indicating that the NSA monitored the German Chancellor's mobile phone Angela Merkel, as well as phone numbers of about 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Klapper defended spying on allies as necessary and said it was a common matter on both sides.
Against the background of this hype, Murphy said that his office will organize a trip to Congress members, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hopes that the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still under development.
Although Murphy said that the purpose of the trip is to promote the improvement of relations, he said that some degree of "hardness of the best motives" will also be manifested.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spyware they have used for many years.
"Ways we can change our tracking programs to better defend the rights of Europeans, they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only ones who are engaged in intelligence activities," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry should go this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address the problems of hostility towards the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the intelligence activities of the United States.
In the United States, the director of the school fired at teenagers.
The director of one of the American secondary schools teenagers literally brought to despair.
The man, he said, had to take the weapon and start shooting.
The incident occurred in the state of Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile bullies threw a man's house with toilet paper.
Because of this, the director of the school opened shooting on teenagers, as a result of which several injuries in the leg and hand received a 15-year-old boy.
Since the bullies were not on the territory of the director's property, he was charged with an attack in aggravating circumstances.
The man was released from prison on bail of $125 thousand.
It should be noted that shooting in civilians in the United States becomes a terrible regularity.
Just before, a man opened fire in the center of Ridgecrest in the American state of California right on the street passers-by.
After that, the criminal took hostage two accidental passers-by, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to hide.
Earlier in the primary school of Newtown, Connecticut, shooting was opened.
Adam's mother worked at the school, she was an educator.
Shooting in American school: injured 14-year-old girl
Another incident with shooting occurred on January 31 in the American school, this time in Anlanta (Georgia).
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.
The Chinese newspaper to publish the call is subject to reorganization."
The Chinese newspaper, which published on the front page a call to release the defendant in libel of the reporter, should be reorganized, the press regulator reports.
Published in Guangzhou newspaper Novy Express made an unexpected public statement asking for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes for writing false articles about the company with the state share of ownership.
Now the "New Express" must pass the process of complete error correction, as the regulator reports.
The order on the error correction came from Guangdong management in the press and publications, radio, film and television.
The preliminary investigation showed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express newspaper published several false reports on the Zoomlion company registered on the stock exchange between September 2012 and August 2013.
The leadership of the editorial office of the "New Express" was disoriented," reads the statement of the regulator.
He reports that it was decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a revocation of his reporter license.
He also instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to correct the mistakes in the New Express and recommended her to investigate the situation of the newspaper responsible persons and immediately make changes to the management of the New Express.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he declared financial violations in the company engaged in the construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After being detained his newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stated that she supports his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on the state television with recognition that he published false articles for money.
"In this case I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust," he said to the state-owned broadcasting company CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was thirsty for money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
After the recognition of Mr. Chen, the New Express published an apology on the front page, saying that the newspaper failed to properly check his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made recognition on television.
Experts say that the practice of embodding recognition in China is still widespread, despite the recently adopted amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities to force anyone to self-conspiracy.
Due to the riot of impure force had to close several schools and hospital
Four schools in the Zimbabvi province of South Matabeleland had to be closed due to the fact that the students were attacked... goblins.
As the local elder said, the children panicked, and it was impossible to continue classes.
The story of goblins can be heard as a fiction of a child for a European, but in Africa this is quite a serious argument for closing the school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, in Zimbabwe the hospital was closed due to the fact that the medical staff also attacked goblins.
Firefighters were called to rescue the lost puppy, who stuck at a height of 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous career
Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after hit in a small accident
Three days later, stuck in her career, noticed a man who was walking out the dog
Firefighters went down on a rope along the sheer slope to save the dog from imminent death
The clerk was fortunate to escape after the fire brigades were summoned to raise him and take him to a safe place after he somehow stuck at a height of 50 feet on a dangerous rank of a hedgehogg slope.
The nine-month-old coker Spaniard Ruby fled after she got into a car accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her hosts, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at the Flepite career in Denholm in West Yorkshire to rejoin Ruby, and thanked the fire and rescue service of West Yorkshire.
They were feverishly looking for their missing dog and posting appeals on social media sites after she ran away in a career after a small accident.
At about 14:15 on Wednesday, a vigry dog breeder noticed Ruby, stuck at a height of 50 feet in a career.
The technical rescue squad from the fire station Klekhiton hurried to the scene, went down on ropes to save Ruby, and used the carrying to lift it up the slope.
An Andy Clayton, an officer of the rescue squad, said: "She was in a dangerous position."
It was right in the middle of the sheer slope of 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She did not drive and froze during the rescue, she completely froze.
But now it's all right.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is unveriable.
An officer-specialist rescue squad Peter Lau said: "Ruby is very lucky that she was saved."
It was likely that she could get a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for inspection, and it was found that everything was fine with her, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Galifax, West Yorkshire, said, "To watch the salvation was terrible."
I couldn't believe that she was there at all.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been exhausted and lost consciousness, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were gorgeous.
It was very brave, what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from the city of Kitley added, "We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there."
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe that she was there.
Do you think the travel agents have gone back to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to have a reverse trend.
The company updated its full-year profit guidance and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
This travel agency now expects its full annual profit to taxation from $325 to $340 million, compared to the previous forecast in the range of $305 to $315 million.

This includes Australia and the UK, which usually bring us the largest profits.
In Australia, leisure business in the second half of the year recovered, which offset a somewhat weaker domestic market of corporate trips.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure business was going well, while corporate customers spent less.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, until late not to go to bed and arrange a masquerade for our district.
Now I'm going to be more squabbled.
I have not been called in the last two years to distribute sweets in my apartment and, most likely, will not be this year.
However, statistics show that I am a white crow as to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans - namely 158 million - will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6,9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I expect every Halloween is the trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that the costumes will cost $1.2 billion out of $6.9 billion spent.
This year at the peak of fashion sexy inanimate items.
Women no longer have to be representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we will see a lot of zombies thanks to the Walking Dead, and I am sure that the cosmonauts in the style of the Daft Punk group will get into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the costumes that are looking for most often, are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
Perhaps there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year.
This means a lot of funny ham dogs.
When it comes to candy, we do not care.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
This is about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, lollipops, sweets Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is excellent news for 41 million children requiring candy, who have prepared to conquer our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and will not deceive ourselves - eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to eat is sweets in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Association of Confeders, almost 35 million pounds are sold under Halloween.
This is about 9 billion individual corn grains.
This is a riddle that I still have to solve.
Nothing so expresses the essence of Halloween as at home with ghosts.
They have stunning names, for example, "Word behind the walls" (which, incidentally, is in a real prison), "WE" and a cry and "House of shock."
Moreover, according to the America Haunts society, in America there are 1,200 officially recognized houses with ghosts that generate about $500 million of income, as well as those stunning photos where you almost described, which your friend posted on Facebook, and you can not remove, and then the guy you like, sees this photo and leaves a comment like a classy expression.
And in conclusion, we will talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and the cutting of Jack's lamp is like a Christmas tree decoration, what we have been doing since childhood.
Fortunately for us, the fashion for a baby pumpkin began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew by cutting these pumpkins rather than sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year the Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack's light, slowly drying on your porch, probably arrived from Illinois, which this year's 542 million pounds of pumpkin.
If you want a more complex task, naver Tim and Susan Mattisdon in Napa, California, and try to cut something out of their pumpkin weighing 2032 pounds.

The U.S. Tunnel Discovered . Mexico for Drugs, equipped with its own railway
One of the most difficult tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system systems.
The U.S. authorities described this four-way-wide tunnel as one of the most difficult secret passages ever discovered by them.
This tunnel, which consists of a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This area is filled with inconspicuous warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs in trucks.
The Tunel was closed before any drugs were imperceptibly transferred through it, as the authorities said.
According to the court documents, law enforcers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was found.
Three men, who, according to law enforcement, worked as drivers, were charged with storing marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of spreading.
In case of condemnation, they face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The Tunel is the eighth major pass found in San Diego since 2006.
Several major tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after marijuana harvest in October, which set a difficult task of fast delivery of their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards, equipped with rail tracks, which went from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses of San Diego.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died by a ridiculous accident, believe that their son was killed
Parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found inside the collapsed sports mat in the gym of his high school, believe that their son was killed, said the lawyer of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from the city of Valdast, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertically standing mat, leaned behind the stands in the gym of his high school.
The investigators of the Lounge County Sheriff's Office came to the conclusion that Johnson died by tragic accident, but the 17-year-old teenager's family contests this.
"They are absolutely sure that their son was killed," said FoxNews.com Benjamin Krump, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed that he had died as sheriff said.
"They believe that this is contrary to the logic, the laws of physics, as well as common sense," said Kromp.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
They sent their son to school with a school bag, and they gave them back in a sack for the corpses, he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday that he is conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What caused death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will study all the facts wherever they bring.
My goal is to know the truth.
"I hold the opinion that there is a sufficient reason for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told the reporters that the initial opening showed that Johnson died as a result of the "positional asphyxiation."
However, the second showdown, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
"There are several questions to be resolved or clarified," he said.
Moore added that if he finds evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation of Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to hold him.
The representative of the Lounge County Sheriff's Department was not available for comment when they contacted him on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the judge of South Georgia ordered the authorities to publish all the video-recordings of surveillance cameras watched by investigators.
The parents of the teenager said that they hope that the video recordings contain the key to the solution of how he died.
Pakistani authorities start negotiations with local Talibs
The Pakistani authorities started negotiations with the Taliban movement.
This was reported by the Embassy of the country in Great Britain, where Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The head of the Pakistani government made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Niko Kleg, with whom he discussed the issues of relations between Pakistan and India, the global energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.

Pakistani Talibs (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the same name of the Afghan movement, but act independently in the north-western regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistani Talibs seek the establishment of an Islamic state.
Earlier, the government of Islamabad attempted to start negotiations with the local Talibs, but the movement refused to dialogue.
It stated that it would go to negotiations only if the authorities withdraw the troops deployed in the areas where the Talibs operate, as well as release the arrested Islamists from prison.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.

The owners of pawnshops in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
In a pawnshop in the Bendemir shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthaling lays a gold bracelet, a ring and earrings to pay for the school training of his daughter.
"My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is invested there," says Ms. Amirthhaling.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, the demand in various parts of Southeast Asia is where the amount of household debt is growing, such that ValueMax, where it conducts its transaction, this week became the third pawnshop registered on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The loan secured jewelry is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Amirthaling), but also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Usually pawnshops in Singapore accrue an effective annual interest rate of 17 % - just above 15.4 % offered in the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require credit checking or salary evidence and can issue loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people in the whole region turn to pawnshops, as families feel pressured due to increased cost of living and rapid growth of debts of households and consumer debts.
After five years of steady growth, which followed the global financial crisis, and cheap loans fueled by free monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pawnshops to compensate for the decline in revenues as their economies slowed down.
This week Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, indicated an increase in the family leverage, mainly due to the growth of mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest debt ratio of households to the gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped this list with 80% of GDP compared to 60 % in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continued decline in exports and weakening consumer demand.
The fact is that with the rise in prices people in the middle and lower part [the towers of income] will look for ways to replenish their incomes where they can, - says Song Seng Wun, economist CIMB, Malaysian bank.
Record high gold prices in the last two years strengthened the rush with which people lay their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70% of things, laid in 200 pawnshops of the city-state, are gold products.
People say: "The target for gold looks good, let's put the grandmother's golden chain and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator EasyMoney observed an increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20 %.
The growth in pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemir and 15 other similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 percent of S$66mn raised this week as a result of the placement of shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors have caused criticism due to high interest rates, Yeah says that pawnshop not only offers cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also does not increase the debt directly.
"Clients lay the items they already own, and monetization of personal assets does not increase household debts," she says.
The deposit is gaining more and more public recognition as a means to obtain short-term, secured financing.
And at the same time pawnshops use not only those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Rich people in Singapore also use the ValueMax divisions, laying gold bullion or Rolex watches that can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see customers from all strata of society.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for a short time for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties," says Mrs. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Bashkiria may put grain on sale not earlier than in 2014
Bashkortostan during the state procurement interventions may put grain on sale not earlier than in 2014, according to Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
While the price on the market is higher, and there is demand.
"The grain will be put up for sale, after the New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister reminded that this year crop crops for the harvest of 2013 amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
For the harvest of 2014, 550 thousand hectares were sowed (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
The area under winter wheat and triticale has been increased, and rye remained at the same level.
A football fan was detained in the Voronezh region, who broke a window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o'clock in the evening of October 29 at the station Gryazi-Voronezh employees of the transport police removed from the passenger train two football fans - natives of the Moscow region.
Going to the game of your favorite team, the guys on the way arranged a drunken debosh on the train.
Young people were taken to the duty part of the linear police station at Gryazi station to draw up a protocol on administrative offense.
There the fans repented of their anti-social behavior.
Policemen issued administrative material on them and released.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station station began to wait for his arrival.
In the first half of the night, the fans left the building of the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old guy, suddenly returned and with his foot smashed the window of the front door in the waiting room of the station.
On the sound of the broken glass rushed the traffic police officer and guard of the CHP "Russian Railways."
They managed to delay the attacker who tried to escape from the scene.
Employees of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia conducts checks.
The question of initiating a criminal case is being raised, said Sergey Olkhovik, senior referent for the direction of information and public relations of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport.
The Russian security and law enforcement agencies know nothing about the "Brother Circle" group - Novye Izvestia
This writes INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After reports were reported in the media about the introduction by the US Department of Finance Leps in the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brother circle" - we have viewed all the databases, but such a group has not been found," the agency's interlocutor said.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly acts abroad.
As "Ni" previously wrote, yesterday the US Department of Finance published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group "Brother Circle."
Among them was named Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He appears in the list as "Grish," posted the day before.
They coincide with the data of the popular Russian performer.
The exact name is Grigory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to the Leps, there are five more people mentioned.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another native of the former USSR, whose citizenship is not specified.
The U.S. is confident that Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket transported money for bandits on their order.
This message is accompanied by a photo of the singer and all his data, which correspond to reality, are indicated.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The Ministry stressed that they are going to impose sanctions against Leps.
The entry of a person into the blacklists of the U.S. Finance Ministry entails blocking his assets in the U.S. and a ban on business contacts with him of persons residing in the United States.
Assistant Leps Maya Serikova said that no notifications to the singer were received: "It is difficult to answer the question whether it is Gregory, who is now talking about in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All that Leps knows is media information.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I don't know if they are in such cases.
"And, of course, this is all, on the one hand, ridiculously, and on the other - surprisingly and unexpectedly," she said.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live in Phuket, but, according to the U.S. Finance Ministry, he really has a house on the Thai island.
She said that Leps is now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him during the flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Do you have a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the crumbling road system, many begin to see the solution in a small black box, carefully attached to your car's dashboard.
These devices, which monitor each mile and transmit this information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt to modernize the outdated system of financing the American highways, undertaken by the planned authorities of Washington and the state.
Usually the boring highway planning arena suddenly gave rise to intense debates and colorful alliances.
The Libertarians have joined the environmental groups lobbying for the right to use small drawers to monitor the number of miles you pass, and even perhaps where you pass them - and then use this information in the preparation of tax accounts.
The tea party movement is shocked.
The American Union of Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of issues regarding privacy.
Although the Congress cannot agree yet, whether or not, several states are not going to wait.
They reflect on how the next decade can go to a system in which drivers pay for every mile road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already taken to test these black boxes, some of which have the function of satellite tracking.
This is really necessary for our country.
"This is not the question we may have the right to choose," said Hassan Ihortah, Executive Director of the Association of Governments of Southern California, who is preparing plans to start tracking the state of miles passing by each Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There are already technologies for this.
The need for this is aggravated by the lack of funds from the Government Fund for the construction of highways financed by taxes that the Americans pay at the petrol stations.
Americans no longer buy as much gasoline as before.
Cars travel more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even by one cent at high prices for gasoline.
"The tax on gasoline is simply impossible to save," said Lee Mannich, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on cars to test the slam use system.
"This will be the best alternative in the long term," he said.
The nudes call it a slender custom plate.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts city liberals, because with the help of taxes it will be possible to change the nature of trips to reduce the load of roads and emissions of greenhouse gases, for example.
The planned authorities in California are looking at this system in the course of developing strategies to achieve targets established by the ambitious laws of this state to combat global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives Bill Schuster (republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the transport committee of the Chamber, said that he also considers this system as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free market adherents in the fund is also delighted with the fact that drivers will be paid for every mile.
"This is not just a tax that will go into the black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President for Political Affairs Reason.
People directly pay for what they receive.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called on the Congress to move towards the samp in the direction of the slam being paid.
Last year, the US Senate approved a pilot project worth $90 million, which would involve about 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal due to fears of rural legislators representing voters who often have to pass a lot of miles in everyday life to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, go along this path on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is manifested in the state of Oregon, where to participate in the largest experiment in the country involved 5,000 drivers.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles of running instead of the gasoline tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
In New York, it is considered.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes transport departments of 17 states of the eastern coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studies how they can carry out these changes.
This concept has not been universal recognized.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government can track every step of them.
"The dissatismanation of the "big brother" and such things is a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and efficiency management in the Department of Transport of Nevada.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the trials were in full swing, the separation of the American Union of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its website: "It will be easy to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices.
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure, which will inevitably expand to store records of everyday movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where difficult search for inexpensive technology is conducted, which would allow the state authorities to take account of miles passing by the car, but without information about the place and time.
If you can do it, said Khan, society will feel more calm.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company was not engaged in the taxation of the state.
She sought to enter the developing market of motor insurance, in which drivers pay on the basis of the run.
But the devices that it tests attract road designers because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically downloaded using a modem.
"People will be more inclined to do so if you don't track their speed and don't track their location," said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director of True Mileage.
There were a few big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less obsessive ways to do so.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with the provision of various options to drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles, which is passing by all residents of the state.
In other places hope to sell the idea of a wary public, for making devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials seek to develop a tax-doing device that will also accept payment by parking meters, provide payments, how you go insurance and collect a pool of data on real time from other drivers who motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will attract the benefit they will offer," " says the document of urban planning.
Some designers of transport systems, however, think about whether all conversations about the litril payment are just a huge distraction factor.
In the city transport commission in the Gulf of San Francisco officials say that the Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the trust fund for the construction of highways, having increased taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be charged to drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline to pay their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgical intervention, when all you need to do is to accept aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Legal and Public Relations Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.
Pope Francis will call the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will rank new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on February 22, as announced on Thursday Vatican.
Cardinal is the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after Pope, and it is they who choose the Pope, so that Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in the choice of his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinal.
However, after reaching the cardinal of 80 years of age, he can no longer participate in the elections of Pope - this is the prerogative of the group 120 Scardinal-Elators.
Announcing this news, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardy said that a meeting of all current cardinals known as the consissistois will be held before the ceremony of erection.
"Papa Francis has decided to inform in advance of his decision to convene a constory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," said Lombardy.
Jack Valero from the organization "Catholic voices" said that by February the number of cardinal electors will probably decrease.
He said that the Pope usually calls as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinal electors to 120, as well as as as many cardinals aged over 80 years as he wishes.
The consistory next year will be of great importance, because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March this year, according to Valero.
At the moment, there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new cardinal father will appoint from other regions of the world to restore the balance, " he noted.
In South America, there are forty percent of Catholics, but they are represented by a negligible number of cardinals.
This will also be the first cardinals chosen since the formation of the Council of Cardinals by Francisco - a group of eight cardinals from around the world, which is instructed to look for ways to reform the church.
In the past, Papa decided everything on his own.
"Now Francis chose eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said that it was possible that Francis would appeal to the cardinals for advice.
But we were not in such a situation before that - all this for us for the first time.
Valero said that Papa was usually appointed as Cardinal Bishops from major parishes, but Francis sludges - so we do not know who he will call.

Tax for foreign property owners will lead to the fact that the London bubble will burst
The Treasury has fulfilled a preliminary assessment of the measures on capital gains, but expects the final decision from Mr. Osborne, which in the 2012 budget introduced a state duty rate of 7 % for houses worth more than 2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own homes in the Company, not as individuals.
At the moment, the state fee for residential properties in the areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to 708 million pounds in 2012/13 financial year, already exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, northeast, north-west, Yorkshire and Hamber combined.
Mr. Cook said: "After the increase of the state fee on expensive houses and the introduction of the related legislation against evasion is very difficult to assert that the taxation of expensive real estate is understated regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system.
But this step may lead to the fact that some foreign investors will reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners will not want to sell it, he added.
The value of first-class real estate - the top 5x10% of the housing market at a price in the rich south-west belt of London, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a steady growth of 5.6% year on year, but they were overswitty by the actively developing massilities market with a surge in south-west, north (7.4 %) and in the east (6.5%) of the city.
The next meeting of the Association of Machine Builders of the Tyumen region was held on the basis of Yalutorovsky automobile plant.
Within the framework of the event, a new steel supply line was presented.
According to the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov, in 2011 with the advent of a new owner, a marketing research on the market for the sale of steel structures in the Tyumen region was conducted.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electric weeding pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment on it for their production.
Already this year, more than 7 thousand tons of produced products have been shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new mill was launched, which allows you to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for the greenhouse economy, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and large - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will be about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase in staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is retraining personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new longitudinal cutting unit of steel to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another mill, with the speed of production of pipes to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of pipes that are used in housing and communal services.
The company's management aims to close up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region in this product.
Leonid Ostroumov, Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, advising the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
The forms of state support of the industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the costs of its leasing, are also aimed at this.
This year, it is planned to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider subsidies, accepts documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget is compensated for the cost of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the next year, the budget provides funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million - for energy saving programs.
The funds for reimbursement of the ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex, are being lowered to 72 million rubles.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future this form of support will cease, as the reason for its introduction was the compensation of the mineral extraction tax, which oil companies paid to the regional budget.
Currently, they do not do this and subsidies become direct expenditure obligations of the region.
Taking this into account, the government of the region considers the direct support of industrial enterprises, rather than financing through them to the oil sector as a priority.
The budget assistance will be related to investment projects, which will be implemented in production.
Many business executives expressed concern about the current situation in relations with oil workers.
The subsidy for the equipment purchased by them is a competitive advantage of the industry of the south of the Tyumen region, and when it is abolished, it will be difficult to compete at the price of the middle strip of Russia, where cheaper labor force.
In addition, the issue of continuity of the new owner of TNK-BP - Rosneft, which does not place its orders at Tyumen enterprises, is unclear.
The Uvatsky Project Implementation Agreement expires in 2013, and no applications for its extension have been received.
Currently, enterprises in the south of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, can not form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
The question remains open whether taxes will be received from the oil produced in the Uvat district in the budget of the region or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.

Syria has destroyed its means of making chemical weapons, says the observation team
Syria destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poison gas, said an international observation group on Thursday, while fierce clashes raged in the north of the country, not far from one of the objects where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian group of activists said that more than 120,000 people were killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of November 1, established by this organization based in The Hague, in order for Damascus to destroy or "make incapable" all chemical weapons production and mechanisms that allow mixing chemicals with the receipt of poison gas and fill them ammunition.
The end of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule, which aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus still has to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
The country is believed to have about 1000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve-paralytic sarin gas.
This statement was made during the fierce battles on Thursday in the city of Safira, in which, according to experts, there is an object for the production of chemical weapons, as well as its storage, according to the Syrian Human Rights Protection Center based in Britain.
A group of activists, who monitored the losses through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120 296 people were killed.
Of this number, as it was said, 61,067 are civilians, including 6365 children.
On the part of the government, the group said, 29,954 people are members of the armed forces of President Bashar al-Assad, 18 678 are pro-government militants and 187 - Lebanese militants of Hezbollah.
Also among the victims, as stated in the statement, there were 2202 army rebels and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to the UN estimates of July 25, 100,000 were killed in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
The Assad troops fought for several weeks in Safire with the rebels, many of whom are associated with the groups of Al Qaeda.
The Center said that on Thursday there were victims on both sides, but did not provide specific data.
The battles highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, set up by the short deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works closely with the United Nations, says that its team was now satisfied with the fact that it checked and saw all the critically important means of production and equipment for mixing and refuling declared by Syria.
She added that the additional inspection activities are not currently planned.
Earlier this week, the inspectors said that they completed the first round of inspection work, visiting 21 of 23 objects declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW announced that both places were, according to Syria, abandoned and... items of chemical weapons programs in them were moved to other declared places that were verified.
It was not possible to find out immediately whether the object was in Safir one of the two places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which should be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I welcome the courage and courage you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said Ahmet Uzyumju, Director General of the Observation Group, in a comment published by the OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has been confronted by the Sunnites, mostly the Sunni Muslims, the Assad government and its security forces, which consist of members of its Alawite sect, the branch of Shiite Islam.
As for other events, the head of the center Rami Abdurrahman said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at the air defense facility in the coastal province of Syria Latakia.
The reason for the explosion is unknown, he said.
Postal: Obama's electoral staff considered Biden's exclusion in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest advisors secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This is the discovery of the most vivid sensation of all the expected book by Mark Galperin and John Hailemann about the 2012 campaign "Becomes doubled: The game has changed 2012."
The Times received a copy of the book to be released and reported on Thursday evening that the next presidential aides had conducted large-scale research in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011 to assess whether Biden's exclusion could help raise Obama's extinct hopes for re-election.
According to the political observer of The Times Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempts of high-ranking officials of the electoral staff and the White House, namely the former head of the White House administration Bill Daley, to assess the effect of the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton as Vice President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded at the Chicago electoral headquarters and in the Oval Cabinet.
Only six closest advisors to the President, including Daley, former head of Obama's electoral staff, Jim Messin and former senior advisers of the White House David Axelrod and David Pluff knew that the replacement was being considered.
The book "States are doubled" asserts that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden, despite their close personal relations, but eventually gave up this step when their data showed that the addition of Clinton to the electoral list would not improve Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration really considered the possibility of replacing Biden Clinton.
"I actively spoke for the consideration of many things, and it was one of them," said Daley to the newspaper.
You must remember that at that time the president was in a terrible form, so we thought: "Oh God, what should we do?"
Although Daley described the study as a necessary test, Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that the electoral headquarters has invested a lot in examining whether this step will bring dividends to voting.
"Elimbing staffs do not spend such amounts of money on surveys and focus groups, if they do not consider something seriously," Martin said in the AK 360 program.
It is unclear whether Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of substitution.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daly if he knew his then boss about a possible re-sup.
Although Daley said he did not think that the president was aware of the possible replacement, the former head of the administration admitted that, perhaps, Obama knew.
Martin added that the "Study is doubled" does not give a clear answer to the question whether the results of political sensing reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believes that Obama did not know about the study of the possibility of expelling Biden from the electoral list.
"Perhaps," Martin replied.
The head of the RFS Control and Disciplinary Committee Arthur Grigoryants said that "Kuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles, reports from the House of Football correspondent of "SE" Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club are applied for the arson of the Dagestan flag by fans at the stands during the home match of the 14th round against "Anji."
At the meeting were representatives of both clubs, a person from the RFPL.
We have investigated all the available materials.
For the incorrible behavior of the spectators, Kuban was fined 500,000 rubles.
Legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers have a bad mood.
According to their estimates, the consumption of beer in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is at best.
Although businessmen initially counted on growth.
After all, this year is unsuccessful for them: sales fell by 7%.
Head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, Chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian brewers Isaac Sheps told about all this at the III Annual Conference of Adam Smith Institute "Queance of Daily Demand in Russia," which has just ended in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already decreased by 18 percent, as in recent years in the country there is a significant increase in regulation of the brewing industry in terms of production and turnover of beer - a drink with a small alcohol content, - Sheps said to the listeners.
In no country in the world there is such a severe limitation of the beer market, unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical bans, which are allegedly based on the fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer complained that many legislative prohibitions designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse do not have much impact, however, there are constantly new initiatives.
The most painful thing for the beer producers was the ban imposed since this year to sell alcohol in kiosks.
"We immediately lost 35 thousand consumers," - said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year, the brewers have two forecasts.
Optimistic - the one spoken of Sheps: the sale of foam drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 percent.
In order to keep their profits, businessmen are forced to leave the varieties designed for the mass consumer, in the class of "premium": the beer will be smaller, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, there are no radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol.
"According to my observations, the level of diseases of alcoholism remains at about the same level, - said the doctor-narcologist Alexei Sotnikov.
However, the share of patients who consume surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who "sed" on alcohol-containing toning drinks like "Jaguar," while ten years ago it was the "blower" alcoholism that prevailed.
What will lead to the construction of TPU in Moscow
Every year the capital authorities promise to arrange more and more transport and transfer nodes (TPU).
By 2020, it is planned to commission 255 TPU.
What the project turns out to be, our correspondent was aware of.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence appeared near the metro station "Smolenskskaya" of the Arbat-Pokrovskaya line.
The inscription said that the arrangement of the transport and transfer unit is underway.
All this was very strange, because next to the "Smolensk" no ground transport stops and, therefore, it is impossible to move to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, it is necessary to overcome about 130 meters, including the ground crossing through the Karmanitsky lane.
Now the "Smolensk" almost everything is over.
The flower stall disappeared, the bench for newspapers was dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance was replaced by a cobblestone.
That's the whole transport hub.
Transport and transfer nodes are flat and capital, - explained in the press service of the Moscow Department of Transport.
There are no capital TPUs yet.
And flat assume the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of commercial facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.
Actually, the flat TPU is even engaged not transporters, but professional builders from the Department of capital repair of the city of Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex structure, - explains Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes enough roof over the head and scoreboard, informing about the time of arrival of transport.
Here, for example, near the metro "Yasenevo" recently opened a completely complete flat transfer hub.
Even without sheds, but with intercepting parking lots and signs indicating when the bus comes.
But in the chasing for the number of officials write down everything to the TPU.
Back in 2011, the City Hall planned to build on all about all 151 knots, of which 59 with capital construction.
Now the plans until 2020 are as much as 255 TPU.
Of these, one and a half promise to surrender back this year.
Although there is a TPU development program in the city, there are no qualitative criteria, says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport."
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of the transfer on each of them is often deteriorated.
According to the expert, there should be two criteria: firstly, the reduction of the time of the transfer, secondly, convenience.
First of all, the opportunity to change the mode of transport, without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, when the TPU is being on the arrangement of the TPU, sometimes goes exactly the opposite.
A striking example of the metro "VDNH."
Previously, suburban buses from Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the All-Russia Exhibition Centre.
Now their stops were moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to the street of Kosmonavtov.
Further from the metro, much further from the monorail, but closer to residential buildings.
It is a gift that the residents did not want the bus station under the windows and complained to all possible authorities.
The capital TPU in Moscow somehow did not be given.
The first of them began to build five years ago near the metro "Planernaya."
The project was designed to become exemplary.
And indeed, there was a sample of how the transfer unit, given to the purchase of investors, turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there are a platform for buses, a canopy, so as not to go from the metro in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.
However, the Khimkin trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU did not give place fundamentally.
They were moved away from the subway like strangers.
But the place for trading remained more.
One only clothing 32 stores, and in general there is almost everything - from zootovarov to the dealership.
Well, in fact, suddenly which of the passengers of the bus will need to buy a new car on the road?
We, when building a capital TPU, for some reason always turns out to be a shopping center.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion, when part of the car park decided to give to the market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planernaya" among the parking spaces marked on the floor is a brisk trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards, maliciously looking at our photographer.
The transfer node finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that earlier the metro "Planernaya" was the market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture traders regretted and allowed to intercept the parking of the transfer unit.
Still, because of the high prices there is always empty.
The most ridiculous thing is that the market was demolished in order to build in its place... a new flat TPU.
This is the rocking.
At the metro "Kaluga" the distance of the approach from the entrance hall of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you need to go through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to bypass it under the open sky.
However, the constructions on the "Planernaya" and "Kaluga" will soon seem flowers.
In mid-September, the City Hall and Land Commission approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital TPU.
Four of them will be 25-storey, not counting two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow by the metro "Tushino," it will have 418.7 thousand square meters. meters.
Representatives of the management of railway stations, responsible for the construction of TPU near the subway, have already told journalists: in future high-rise buildings will be located shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials say that multi-tier parking will take from a third to half of the area.
Let's take for example "people's" garages.
For example, a garage for 258 cars, which has recently been built on the International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters. meters.
So, for parking for 2.6 thousand cars at "Petrovsko-Razumovskaya" will need about 80 thousand "squares."
This is less than a third of the mahina that is going to be built there.
Let one or two floors go on all sorts of apron for buses.
There are at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate.
And this, for a minute, almost two GUMs.
If the capital TPU at the stations and railway stations is built, the rest of the sites will be mastered by metropolitans.
They also promised that there will be many "functional facilities," including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, the Department of Property of Moscow recently told journalists that they are developing a draft resolution according to which investors will be able to apply for a plot for TPU directly to officials.
Without any contests.
Therefore, they say that transport issues for the city are a priority.
The ideal TPU - is, for example, the station "Garward" in Boston or "Spadina" in Toronto, - is sure Alexander Morozov.
There trolleybuses and trams descend under the ground to the level of the subway and the distance of the approach from the metro to the tram is only 50 meters without going to the street.
Around no extra trade.
But Moscow officials are throwing into extremes.
Either we will not build anything, or we will cut off 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Oil fell to $96 per barrel.
The oil price continued to fall on Friday, when the alarms over the formation of large reserves eased a message showing that the energy-intensive production sector of China is gaining strength.
The U.S. benchmark oil grade in December deliveredt by 14 cents, and its price amounted to $96.24 per barrel later in the morning of European time in e-commerce on the New York commodity exchange.
On Thursday, the contract declined by 39 cents, which in total amounted to a drop in the price for October by 5.8 percent.
The rich oil reserves have affected its value over the past weeks.
On Wednesday, the US Department of Energy announced that US reserves increased by 4.1mb over the last week.
In five weeks, the reserves increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, judging by two reports of the Chinese industry, which showed a surge in its activity.
This indicates that the recovery of China's economy may continue to gain strength after the growth rate in the third quarter rose to 7.8% after the twenty-year low in the previous quarter.
Oil Brent is a reference grade of international oil, also used by US refineries, which fell by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the London Intercontinental Exchange.

Coach of "Avangard" Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the match of the KHL regular championship against "Salavata," noted that the emichi conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat from the Magnetogorsk "Metallurg."
The specialist stressed that "Avangard" should pay increased attention to the game in defense.
We watched a video match against the Magnetogorsk "Metallurg," - the official website of "Avangard" the words of Chebaturkin.
- Missed a lot of washers, not a very pleasant moment.
Passed due to their mistakes, due to failure to perform the game task.
We knew that the opponent had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks with the move - three pucks scored us.
Very good implementation.
These mistakes were taken into account when preparing for today's game?
We and the guys carefully dismantle, talk after the game, preparing for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is carried out.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against "Metallurg."
The game assignment was completed and the score was 2:0.
We missed the goal "in the locker room" - and in the third period began to make a mistake.
Given the hard game, I did not see any point in connecting the defenders.
It is necessary to defend the whole team.
Now "Avangard" has a long home series, matches go in a day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All commands are in the same conditions.
The main thing now - the implementation of their moments and the implementation of the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you perform the installation - everything is not so difficult.
Bombardier's profit is decreasing with the drop in supplies and the number of aircraft orders
Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian manufacturer of aircraft and trains, reported on Thursday that net profit was reduced by 15 percent under the influence of reduced number of aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway division.
Bombardier, located in Montreal, also did not publish any data on the flight tests of its latest CSeries aircraft and did not provide new information on whether ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft in commercial operation will be carried out by the next September.
After the first flight of an experimental model of an aircraft, which took place about one and a half months ago, he flew only three times, which raises questions about whether the stage of tests on schedule.
The results failed to justify the forecasts and led to a drop in shares by more than 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation from higher than the average market to the average market due to the conviction that the growth of shares is limited in the coming quarter or two.
"Although the decrease in the number of aircraft supplies was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the profits of the transport department," Doerksen said in a review of the stock market.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders on CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first prototype of the aircraft was presented in March and for the first time made a flight in September after several months of delay.
However, solid orders for CSeries are not too much about 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to check the company's approvals of fuel efficiency and potential efficiency of the new liner.
In total there are 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Bodouan was confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft will be launched in commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is moving forward according to plan.
"Test model of the aircraft has not remained on the ground longer than expected," said Bodouan during the telephone conference, adding that during the downtime of the aircraft were planned ground tests and software updates.
All manufacturers plan to test in different ways.
We decided to spend the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will happen throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples should fly in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow it, as the company reported.
And yet analysts are skeptical about the statement that the first client will be able to start the operation of the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said that it evaluates the commissioning period and will provide new information in the next few months.
This slow pace of flight tests - though apparently in line with the internal schedule of Bombardier - reinforces our view that the commissioning will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015, " said Doerksen.
In the third quarter of September 30, Bombardier's net income shrank to $147mn, or 8 cents per share, from $172mn, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted profit per share remained the same for 9 cents.
Gross income declined slightly from $4.2 to $4.1bn.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross revenue of $4.56bn, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world said that he supplied 45 aircraft per quarter, which is less than the previous year's figure - 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of orders of the aerospace department amounted to $32.9bn as of September 30, without changing since December 31.
"In the aerospace area, the results were in line with our goals, but the small number of incoming orders and the general market conditions have become an unpleasant factor," said Bodun.
Gross income in the aerospace direction fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.

Tory is a new hope of nuclear energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
Burning hydrocarbons (where they are) negatively affects the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Atomic energy is already different, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste disposal.
Recently, scientists drew attention to the torium - another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and, according to experts, its split is not left waste that must be stored for centuries.

Two YMCA employees accused of sexual crimes before being charged against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission became known
Two YMCA NSW employees were accused of sexual crimes against children before the 2011 accusations against a childcare employee in Caringbach Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission for Sexual Violence reported.
But in the opening statement of the Commission it was said that she had never had a case of sexual violence against children inside her organization.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hayre was asked about one case when YMCA employee was accused of crimes related to child pornography, and another case when the gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted for sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hayre told Geil Ferness, a lawyer who was assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second.
He admitted that YMCA in the opening speech for the commission also made inaccuracy, claiming that there were external inspections of YMCA, who admitted that YMCA was in the front ranks to ensure the safety of children.
The presented commissions testimonies indicate that YMCA was notified that it received the second from the end of four possible assessments based on the results of the quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hayre, who joined the YMCA when he was 21 years old, admitted that he and the lower leadership had missed the Lord, and also failed to provide a clear understanding of the staff's commitments regarding the reports of child safety violations.
Earlier this year, the Lord was convicted for sexual crimes against 12 boys for two years of his work at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hayre rejected the assumption that YMCA's corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting violations of the Lord in the field of child safety.
The staff gave evidence that they were observing violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with the children, personally cared for them, knelt them, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play their mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was under the guidance of the Lord and asked to teach her the protection of children, because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnat, the child care manager of YMCA's department in Caringbach, who was the leader of the Lord, who was a very frightening and often inaccessible.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the explanation of the staff that it was embarrassing for them to report the situation to their superior leaders.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with the Lord led them away from the idea of the need to report it.
Mr. Hayre said that he presented to the Council of YMCA of New South Wales his opinion that the lesson for organizing the incident with Jonathan Lord is not referring to the provision of information from the staff, and the advice agreed with him.
Mr. Hayre said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the appearance of the charges was made by the Director General of YMCA on child care Liam Wytley.
He said that it was intended to prevent the damage of the evidence, but at the same time he was indulged and this decision was poorly implemented.
YMCA New South Wales was not a safe organization for children while working in it by Jonathan Lord in the period of 2009-2011, said the expert on the problems of child planting Professor Stephen Smolboun of the University of Griffith.
He said that there were serious problems in recruitment, selection, instruction, training of personnel and control.
The hearings are postponed until December 20.
The screening of Guyom Niklu's novel by Denis Didro can boast of exceptional production and historical details, but it is also more severe than it should have been.
The film, which takes place in France in the 1760s, tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat sent to the monastery by his family.
When she begins to revolt, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of the gardener-rector and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never falls down to the vulgarity or sensation - and that's the whole problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the narrative risks becoming a test like a slucky and for the audience.
U.S. Special Services Listen to the Pope's Personal Phone
The Vatican's activities are under the vigilant control of the U.S. special services.
New documents from the collection of Edward Snowden show that the U.S. intelligence conducted listening to all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now closely supervises Pope Francis.
His phone began to listen even before he became the head of the Vatican.
The process of election of the new Pope was also monitored.
What in the United States gave special importance.
The Special Service connected to the cardinal cell phones that gathered in Rome to choose another Pope.
The phone numbers of the residence, where the participants of the conclave lived, were also listened.
American spies listened to all the main contenders to the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an undesirable figure for Washington.
The magazine "Panorama" writes that the "big ear of the United States" continued to intercept conversations of prelates until the end of the conclave on March 12.
It is said that in the United States since 2005, the Argentine Archbishop Bergolia was allocated as the future Pope.
The US intelligence also had talks related to the elections of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that the Roman Embassy continues to operate a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives, extractive information about politicians and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican has procedurally announced that it does not concern the American "delivery," even if it happens.
The U.S. leadership has no secrets from the U.S. leaders.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
We can safely say that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the pop artist Frank Fay, who worked at the Palace Theatre at Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a colloquial manner.
The innovation of Fay over time picked up others, quite recently - the New York comedy festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Heursh, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, celebrates this year its tenth anniversary, counting more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Mo more of these headliners started in Carolines, and then achieved more success, reached a level when they are already too famous to perform in the club, "Hursh said.
We created this festival as a way to continue with them work.
This year's event includes performances by Vanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as "Stendap for Heroes" - an annual musical and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where there will be among others Bruce Springstin, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has expanded.
Several comics participating in the festival this year, gained popularity in non-traditional way, for example, thanks to a show on small TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became famous for his role in the comedy series on a little-known cable TV channel (only scoring "Liga" on FXX on the theme of fantasy-football), and now conducts his own sketch show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Slayt joined the acting composition both in the Saturday evening in a live broadcast, and in the Parks and recreation areas, although it is most known by a series of virus videos "Marseille - a shell in shoes."
Both Kroll and Slait, like other young comedian with original style (sur-realistically pessimistic Anthony Gesselynik, cunning, focused on racial themes Kamau Bell), is the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comic, but then became a successful director on television and in cinema, as well as an informal historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007 he was the host of the TV show Land called Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in the Town Hall in the center of Manhattan.
"This city is certainly the central element of Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walked along some street between two houses and thinks, "Here I stayed without money, maybe I'll live here."
