Republican strategy to resist Obama&#39;s re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, arguing that election fraud in the United States is more rare than deaths from lightning.
In addition, Republican lawyers have counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
This is why most state governments have passed laws since 2009 that make it difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon took off after the November 2010 elections, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills were passed restricting voting rights in 41 states.
New electoral laws require voters to present photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register a voter on the day of expression of will and take away the right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no US state required voters to show photo ID.
Indiana became the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to show photo IDs in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identification as a health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people who have reached the legal age to vote, do not have a photo ID issued by their state government.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
That being said, the cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds $ 100.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $ 35,000, 18% of citizens over 65, and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have the required photo ID.
But that&#39;s not all.
Student voters believed to vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use a photo ID issued by their school.
But the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use the certificates issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state required proof of US citizenship to vote.
The first time such a requirement was introduced was in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are US citizens.
These measures are apparently aimed at restricting the voting of Hispanics.
It is believed that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated laws in 2011 abolishing voting day voter registration in eight states.
They also limited the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This limitation did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped enroll about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a 17% drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the early voting period.
For example, during the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of early voters were African American, although the latter made up only 13% of the state&#39;s total voters.
The same thing happened with the Hispanics.
Representing only 11% of voters, they constituted 24% of citizens who voted early.
In contrast to whites, who, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted early were only 46%.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters actively oppose laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws were vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended with the intervention of the Attorney General of the United States.
This made it possible to partially limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring photo identification.
However, the new rules that have come into force will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the electoral right in the 2012 elections.
Democratic critics denounce the biased laws that were passed, seeing them as clearly intended to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral votes required to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Prostate Cancer Screening: To Get The Test Or Not?
In fact, the PSA test produces sometimes erroneous results, false negative and sometimes false positive, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men who are already reluctant to undergo medical examination have something to doubt even more.
Pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there were numerous cases of infection among the study groups, so the findings are difficult to interpret and difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, found different mortality rates in those who were screened and those who did not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of follow-up, that those who did not get screened were 30-40% more likely to develop metastases.
Therefore, I would recommend taking the test from the age of 50, or from 40 if one of the direct relatives has had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at increased risk.
Making the right decision as soon as cancer is found is key.
Cancer can be aggressive or slow-moving.
The patient needs to be educated about the risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without compulsory treatment for prostate cancer, which does not pose a threat to life in the long term, but making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men diagnosed with cancer will not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active monitoring, and if the disease progresses, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly, we are defining precisely the criteria for deciding who should or should not receive treatment.
Thus, I would recommend taking the test anyway.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not you need to take this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of taking a PSA test.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in scientific research, adhering to a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people ate healthy and exercised enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
&quot;If no one else smoked, this figure would have risen to at least 50%,&quot; says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, an estimated 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking control remains a priority despite the decline in smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancers.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes colossal harm to human health.
&quot;Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; says spokesman André Beaulieu.
An encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight
According to CAR data, overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease.
They increase the risk of cancers of the breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, pancreas, and uterus.
&quot;Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,&quot; the Association adds.
Food
The association also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
Too much of it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
&quot;The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; the Association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been researching the effects of vitamin supplementation on cancer.
But at the moment, the results of these studies cannot be called unambiguous.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are showing conflicting results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of developing prostate cancer, then the other gave the opposite result.
The assessment of the effect of vitamin D on cancer development is also not completely clear.
However, Monsieur Beaulieu emphasizes that it is important to discuss your anxiety and family history with your doctor.
&quot;Testing does not lead to cancer.&quot;
The Higgs Boson in Detail
Last summer, the message that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs boson caused quite a stir - and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the Universe, neither more nor less.
It is also the last particle predicted by the Standard Model — our best, or at least the “least imperfect” description of the nature and behavior of matter — but which has never been empirically detected before.
But physicists are not yet completely sure that we are talking about the Higgs boson.
We know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that we are dealing with a truly new particle and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data presented this week at a major physics convention in Kyoto seem to support this, although some data are still lacking to be sure.
Imagine, however, that we are talking about the Higgs boson, since the chances of error seem minimal, and let&#39;s see what this means.
There is, in this world, one absolutely inevitable law, which says that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to get around this rule, do not even try too hard, otherwise you will harm yourself.
But although particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of a similar nature: the Pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they stay in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - this &quot;state&quot; is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called fermions, who prudently obey the Pauli principle.
In the other, the bosons, a vile gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least for this principle, which means that they can safely end up in the same place at the same time - are scurrying about.
According to the website (by the way, completely unusual) Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratory, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: mesons, which we will not talk about here, and &quot;force particles&quot; through which the main forces of nature propagate and to to which the Higgs boson belongs in some way.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly commonplace boson: the photon, or &quot;particle of light&quot;, which is the &quot;courier&quot; of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when one particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it &quot;disturbs&quot; the electromagnetic field at that particular location, much like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this &quot;disturbance&quot; an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and, therefore, one of the bosons of &quot;force carriers&quot;.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be &quot;violated&quot;.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you need to reach very, very high energies, as if we were talking about a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be shaken by a very large stone.
This is why a huge particle accelerator is needed, like the one operated at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring 27 km in diameter! - to achieve such huge energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with an electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, while others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never stick to the refrigerator itself.
Likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like a photon, by the way) do not.
So what does all this research &quot;can bring&quot;, Ms Plamondon asks?
In science, they are used to validate the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to grope for discrepancies between observations and forecasts of the SM.
In addition, some of them are eager for such a discrepancy to be revealed, since the slightest discrepancy can open the door for &quot;new physics&quot; and plug some holes in the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant drawbacks, offering no explanation for gravity (oh!) Or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oh-oh!).
But so far no such discrepancies have been found at CERN.
Effects
The benefits of these studies to the everyday life of the average person are harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that they are not.
Look: at the very beginning of the 60s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell&#39;s laboratories could not even imagine what kind of revolution their work would cause.
They foresaw their applications in science, but nothing more.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first cw laser (the previous ones were pulsed) in 1962, said that initially the laser was viewed more as &quot; laboratory gadget &quot;.
Imagine ...
And in addition, an appendix can be found for the toolkit accompanying the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle, during his optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it was not at all its original purpose, now serves as the &quot;eye&quot; for all digital cameras in the world and earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die ... | &quot;Debt&quot;
The Commission for a Dignified Death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
Debt tried to get a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monterege.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him from the inside gave him a two-year reprieve.
“I was given five years, I lived for seven,” he says, between life and death, lying in bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care shelter in Beleu, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, it’s impossible to prepare for it,” he says.
The disease is doing its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet on your own and even eating on your own.
Sitting at a table with a delicious lunch, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He invigorates, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bath.
Courage in the face of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is to have my diarrhea cured, it&#39;s humiliating,” he admits.
Several hours later, staff found a cure for the ailment.
&quot;Throughout our lives, we are taught that men should urinate while standing,&quot; says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois shelter.
To regress to the state of a child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
&quot;It all depends on the person&#39;s ability to&quot; come to terms with decline, &quot;he says.
Because, according to many palliative care people, important events happen in the midst of this decline.
Patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois palliative care facility are all cancer patients.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses no longer provides what is called &quot;curative&quot; help.
Ms. A., 89 years old, is most afraid of dying &quot;conscious from suffocation.&quot;
But the disease allowed me to recognize my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t want anything else in life,” she says, before allowing her to put on a mask to ease breathing.
She is still waiting in the coming days for the last visit of her son, who came from Italy.
At Victor-Gadbois Shelter, with the help of a group of volunteers, body care and nutrition are provided.
This is palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care place for every 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little, considering that sooner or later we will all die.
Here life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors at the orphanage.
Whether it&#39;s physical, emotional or mental comfort.
For the dying person, we will agree to provide mouthwash of brandy or Pepsi, whichever he asks.
We no longer force diabetics to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
We brought beer to Mr. H. last night, who died tonight.
In the morning, his son finished this beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help our loved ones as well as our patients,” says Natalie Savard, director of nursing.
At the Victor-Gadbois orphanage, not a single day is like the previous one.
Next to a 93-year-old man, who is enjoying his last meeting with his family in the courtyard, sitting on his pillows during a toast in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children and trying everything to survive.
“In the last six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christian Martel with concern.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois shelter come from home and 47% from the hospital.
The challenge of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, which is the kind of care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stage of their life, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor-Gadbois Shelter and the Greater Montreal Palliative Home Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this large gap in Quebec&#39;s health care system that makes many palliative care physicians fearful of a law that would legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by the luminaries in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuinte, and testifying to their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec&#39;s healthcare system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to relieve them.
I am afraid that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists are trying to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Ellen Richard&#39;s survival hopes were already diminishing when she stopped grueling chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she regretted that I was stopping the fight, ”she says.
At the same time, she herself told me that my days are numbered!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who ask to die thank the staff for not following their request after the palliative care team relieves their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not completely omnipotent in dealing with pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Palliative Home Care Society, patients are non-responsive to pain relief in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time or constantly.
We can no longer pretend that we do not know about this suffering.
Increasingly, patients who fail to relieve pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain always say the same phrase: &quot;I want to die.&quot;
But this does not necessarily mean &quot;I want to be euthanized&quot;, it means &quot;I want to make it easier for me.&quot;
This story was made possible by a journalism grant from the Health Research Institute of Canada.
Large scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia experts share day after day what they know about the colossal &quot;system&quot; that entangles the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters.
An &quot;industry&quot; that cost the taxpayers of Quebec dearly, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
&quot;It&#39;s curious how this system collapses after all the means have been put into action,&quot; jokes Jacques Duchenot, MP and former police chief of Montreal.
It was thanks to him that a scandal erupted in 2011 as a by-product of an investigation of malfeasance related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the liberal prime minister of the time, Jean Chare, agreed very reluctantly.
The Duchenot Report established a direct link between industry, the secret financing of political parties, and corruption.
“Since the investigation began in 2010, he stresses, the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts,” if some held back their instincts to take a share.
The Charbonneau Commission &quot;has already removed two mayors,&quot; he adds, hoping it can &quot;uncover the schemes behind individuals.&quot;
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, joined the case and included an extensive staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the special unit &quot;Hammer&quot;, who after 2009 forced the &quot;sewage cartel&quot; of Montreal, to stop inflating the cost of contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out in recent weeks, and several municipal officials, notably Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the small town mayor, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
Next in line is Gilles Vayancourt, who recently retired as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in the province of Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes when placing government orders.
In addition, several Italian railway engineers and construction contractors, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been formally charged.
The latter detonated a real bomb, telling the investigation about the &quot;system&quot; for obtaining government contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of contracts concluded in Montreal, to some middleman connected with the mafia, who, in turn, transferred money to Mayor Gerald Tremblay&#39;s party &quot;United Montreal&quot;.
In the 2000s, Zambito wasted money left and right. He donated over 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mainly the liberals then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally raised funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party Natalie Normando.
Sewer contracts that overstated the cost
In Montreal, the corruption &quot;system&quot; worked flawlessly.
Gilles Surprenand, a former civil engineer, described it in detail before the commission: over ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, to golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey matches, and bribes totaling $ 736,000 from construction firms. in exchange for sewer contracts, which he inflated.
Other officials responsible for building the roads admitted to getting on their paws by inflating the bills by 30-40% with the help of fake add-ons.
Then one organizer from the mayor&#39;s party, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that was filling the party coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay stepped down in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first MPs in Montreal to sound the alarm.
The mayor of the Riviere de Prairie County in the east of the island, she has opposed the sale of a municipal lot bought for $ 5 million and resold for ... 1.6 million since 2010 to developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation that will eventually be launched, she will &quot;pull the thread to understand the functioning of the ant infested system to stop the gangrene and identify the culprits.&quot;
She describes this process as &quot;painful, but positive.&quot;
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How do we clean the house.
Regularly.
For his part, Jacques Duchenot notes that &quot;officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but he is particularly worried about the role of &quot;elected officials who knew about this scheme,&quot; but did not participate in the machinations.
Considering that the share of dirty money in campaign finance in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: &quot;I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality.&quot;
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $ 100, but, he said, this will not change the situation: &quot;As long as we do not severely limit electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics.&quot;
It requires a complete overhaul of the system for providing government contracts and financing parties: &quot;We cannot go lower; by boldly understanding the essence of things, we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and the rule of law.&quot;
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Monsieur Duchenot encourages those who laugh to look into their own backyard ...
&quot;PSG are not FC Barcelona!&quot;
This season, you at PSG have achieved extraordinary scope.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be explained by a new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up next to them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors force me to raise my level of play on a daily basis.
And during the match, it&#39;s easier.
Everything happens very quickly in football.
But I&#39;m not getting angry.
From the very beginning at the pre-training center at the NIF in Clairfontaine until I came to Saint-Etienne, I have always stepped forward.
In this way, you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti ...
This summer&#39;s additions are not new to playing very high-level matches.
They also know that every workout is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me craves to be on the level and give all the best.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti provides support in my positioning.
He is assisted by substitutes like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the master of the situation?
Sure.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technical staff.
Today in the First League he has no equal and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience and has won many titles with high-profile clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I walked away from a whole series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In the First League, Lyon took the leader&#39;s place from us.
But we are still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have effectively qualified to one-eighth of the final.
What is the goal of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on everything can be.
We will be able to say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, in order to be able to host the return match in the eighth final.
Can PSG become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for this ...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate its position in the long term.
This is not the case today.
PSG has the financial means to make this project a reality.
Not taking the First League title like last season would be a big flop?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to earn this championship title.
We were close to that last season.
In May, it was disappointing, because we had everything to come to the finish line first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
Typically 79 points represent the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be all right.
Despite the fact that such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have entered the fight for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don&#39;t you think the media are expecting too much from PSG?
It&#39;s normal that a lot is expected of us, considering how much has been invested and what kind of players we have.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and they still find us something to criticize, of course, it is a little frustrating.
We ask ourselves what people expect from us in the first place.
We can never win every weekend 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement a game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proven in the Champions League that we can meet modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which for two seasons has failed to reach one eighth of the finals, although they also spent a lot of money!
Considering the amount invested, we represented you 15 points ahead by the winter break.
It would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not up to par last season, were &quot;awakened&quot; by this new PSG.
This shows just how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and tell ourselves that despite all the difficulties, we won as a result.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So what if they say that there is some kind of &quot;Zlatanodependence&quot;.
It just means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is the star of the First League.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a global star.
In the group, we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game as well.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you get through Euro 2012 with the French national team?
How disappointing.
I was eager to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from snatching some playing time.
I saw many things there, and I came out stronger from there.
Today I manage to play good qualifying matches.
This is what I have hoped for since my baptism by the BLUs.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must behave in an exemplary manner.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps&#39; early months at the helm of the Blues?
They are effective for him.
He has a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
He is a strict coach, he is close to the players and inspires them to win.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I would not like to compare.
Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us for Euro.
Hope Didier Deschamps brings the Blues to Brazil.
A well deserved draw (1-1), pulled out on October 16 in Spain - is this a foundational match?
This match gave us confidence in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, there were no such matches in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The exact opposite of current central bank-based monetary exchange, numbered transactions between receiving parties with processing fees.
Also, as is often the case with these technologies, there is a clear political vision: the belief that the current monetary system of banking monopolies is leading to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros ...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows file exchange between peers of the same level.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered from 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoin for donation or payment.
Bitcoin, which peaked at $ 30 (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $ 2 five months later before returning to about $ 10 today (see bitcoincharts.com for rates).
Nothing fancy compared to the worldwide exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB), in its October virtual currency report, took an interest in the system.
He describes bitcoin as &quot;the most successful virtual currency&quot;, &quot;competing with the dollar or euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies.&quot;
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, like &quot;credits&quot; used to promote a video game, which are earned during the game, or which can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by some central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes on the network are simultaneously ledgers, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network function?
Every transaction between two users actually happens between two email addresses, much like an email.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically using a double key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public ledger sent out throughout the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this ledger.
It goes through a math problem sent out to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege of adding this new line.
It is about the hashing phase of a file, that is, converting a large file into a digital signature that is short and unique.
Computers “take” a new transaction and add a number to it before “hashing” everything together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many leading zeros).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily check that it is correct.
The transaction is thus inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, the user very quickly (in less than ten minutes) wanted to pay twice with the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solved the problem receives 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the award is regularly halved, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred million, which leaves still some reserve ...
The complexity of the problem also increases with the increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Bitcoin service sites were attacked and bitcoins were stolen from reserves.
&quot;The defect used is not about the protocol itself,&quot; says Pierre Noise, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes real money payments using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also announced the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this disadvantage.
Big players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel analyzed the ledger and found that almost 80% of bitcoins never circulate.
The &quot;Giant Sale&quot; was announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged,” rejoices Jon Holmqvist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Noise, another author of a tutorial on this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment through a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which is thus cheaper.
The holder has better control over his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough just to provide an address that can be &quot;photographed and recognized&quot; by a telephone, Pierre Noise specifies, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
&quot;It will take some time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, suggests, by the way, to reconsider the various risks that are considered to be elevated today, if this system succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What&#39;s next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
The time has come for the Afghan army to regain control of their territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future without relying only on us.
We suffered mainly from Afghan peasants, whom we regarded as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and crippled.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as they did under the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are tolerated, they are sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will no longer be there as soon as the West becomes more delicate.
The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the height of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French loans, was proceeding in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles, accompanied by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advancement from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood due to the struggle between various factions.
Taking control of the country by them was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants, in which they were surpassed by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen, seizing state land to resell for construction to returnees returning from Iran and Pakistan, using huge American subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have managed to do American generosity will leave: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return either to the obscurantism of the old parties, or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world and are watched everywhere.
At the moment there is an army.
Will the authorities that will command her be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, who were leading the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures to restore the provincial squads, which would not be subordinate to the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be decentralized to some extent, along the lines of Western countries, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially ahead of the April 2014 elections.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
The industry has not been put on its feet, not a single dam is functioning, not a single irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by thirty years of war, state control over infrastructure would be necessary.
It was rumored that Afghanistan possesses immense mineral wealth.
This only heightened the feeling that Western countries were there only to take possession of them.
With no energy to process iron ore or copper locally, no means of transportation to export them across the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddhist complex and remain the province&#39;s largest employer.
It is also necessary that one day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are heavily dependent, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a lyceum for girls, for boys, the French language department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for an archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to “win hearts and minds” and fulfill the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the Ministry of Defense (Cimic) “military-civilian activities” service, disbanded in 2012, together with a small French civic organization, has contributed works and activities aimed at the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of local labor, were able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased arable land.
What will we leave as a souvenir by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, which the farmers want, they told me, you need to give them a little non-military support, which would be well controlled and would go directly to them.
Difficult childbirth of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky move by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever, over a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, he has decided to play for broke.
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
It will soon be two years since Egypt has relied on the preliminary text, which has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal controversy.
This new initiative only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his &quot;autocratic delirium&quot;, continuing to &quot;violate the given word&quot; and &quot;trample on the right.&quot;
In the camp of his followers, they are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process.
The referendum must be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time, which makes the Brothers abandon the intention of explaining the text to the Egyptians, article by article.
It is also a way for the president to restore public and democratic legitimacy as discontent rages across the country.
Muhammad Morsy seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in the affirmative, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, the call for an accelerated vote is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: &quot;Either you vote for my text, or I reserve myself extraordinary powers,&quot; which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday in favor of the text.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to convey their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities, or civil society have done the same.
To achieve the required quorum, 11 reserve members were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, in most cases, the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators were amused by the fact that one of the few controversies of the day had arisen around ... prayer time, as some committee members felt the Constituent Assembly clock was set incorrectly.
The text, which was voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
The object of general attention, article 2 ultimately remained identical to the article from the 1971 Constitution, which stated that “the principles of Sharia are the main source of law”.
Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace &quot;principles&quot; with &quot;rules&quot;, which would make it possible to apply them more rigorously.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
&quot;Hypocrisy&quot; - answer the liberals, who see this as only PR.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
They point in particular to Article 220, which grants Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pomier, this is alarming because &quot;the people who are called to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.&quot;
We can observe the birth of a theocracy. &quot;
Many liberals are also agitated by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
“There is no specific religious intervention at the moment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulema, but people with a university education, some of them studied in the French system &quot;- reassures Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that &quot;ambiguity may arise around Article 220, as the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to &quot;fiqh&quot; [Islamic jurisprudence - ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to how competent civil judges are to make decisions about this. &quot;
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday has been criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they have decreased significantly compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defense budget will take place not in Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
Nor will it be prohibited to try civilians in military courts, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider detrimental to freedom.
Liability for blasphemy has been retained, and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for press freedom.
In addition, none of the articles are talking about protecting women anymore, says Heba Moraef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy places, the Navel of the Earth and the sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and pristine nature.
&quot;AiF&quot; identified five of the most important reasons why you need to visit Israel.
Let us bow down to holy places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that God&#39;s grace descends on everyone who enters this &quot;font&quot;.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus&#39; miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples after his resurrection.
But most of all the shrines are in Jerusalem.
Believers here walk the Way of Sorrow or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the Anthony fortress - the Pretorium - where the court was, and along the streets of the Old City it leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the Crucifixion, the Stone of Anointing and the burial place of Jesus.
There is also a symbolic Christian Navel of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was erected on the site where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem, there is also the most holy place for the Jews - the Wailing Wall, left over from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave notes with wishes here, which are then fulfilled.
Take a vertical trip
The ruins of the Massada fortress remain from a secret refuge from enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC. for your family.
They are located on sheer cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are fond of mountaineering can get to them on their own.
The rest to this historic peak are taken by a cable car lift.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a huge influx of tourists.
A shuttle bus delivers to it from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an old legend, pagan gods allegedly lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You cannot visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains the oldest Qumran manuscripts, or the Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
Its exposition includes paintings of the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Al Basha Bath Museum, which consists of several halls of ancient Turkish baths with dummies of visitors and bath attendants of that time.
In Caesarea, visit the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are not accepted.
The fifth - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - the children&#39;s memorial - was built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it - and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are twinkling.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Get well
Israel&#39;s three main resort areas are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and aquariums.
Interestingly, people swim in the Red Sea even in the winter months, since the water temperature there does not drop below 21 degrees Celsius, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people swim there all year round.
By the way, this most extraordinary sea in the world is located at the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below ocean level.
The azure water in it is a brine that easily keeps afloat even those who cannot swim at all.
The landscapes around are unrealistically beautiful.
They come here to undergo a course of treatment with the use of salt water - brine, and healing mud, and to cure their health for dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, in order to put swaying nerves in order.
Touch the secrets of antiquity
They are kept in the old part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
The famous Sea Route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia, passed through it.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists love to wander through the narrow streets named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of &quot;your&quot; sign, Fortune will become supportive.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds who come from all over Israel and even other countries for a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can wander around the Roman theater, &quot;take&quot; the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the seat of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourist notes
Going to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country, about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
It is better to take money for a trip not in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekels (now $ 1 - 3.8 shekels).
Public transport is mostly buses, but Jerusalem has a light rail, and Haifa has the country&#39;s only six-station metro line linking the Lower City to the Upper City.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
Travel in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can travel with changes within 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
Markets, shops and public transport are closed from Friday evening until Saturday sunset.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, there is only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales, and dishes that combine milk with meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts cooked in coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus paste, a variety of sauces, ground chickpea balls - falalel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are a lot of well-fed cats that imposingly &quot;walk by themselves.&quot;
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Purrs love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $ 37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $ 15 per day.
Bicycle rental will cost 15 nis. in a day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
In the language of numbers
In 2012, Israel was visited by over three million tourists from all over the world.
Most of all, citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to travel and rest.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the abolition of visas on February 9, 2011.
&quot;Great and mighty&quot; will bring to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While deputies and human rights activists argue about what the law on compulsory language testing will give, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling &quot;fake&quot; certificates
13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities annually.
For the most part, these are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families left behind.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every labor migrant will be obliged to take an exam on knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and communal services, household and retail trade.
However, over time, the FMS promises, the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
Moreover, you will have to pass not only the language, but also Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both to obtain and to renew a work permit.
The exception is valid only for citizens of those countries where Russian is the state language.
People who managed to obtain certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are also not subject to the law.
Benefit, doom and protection of rights
The network of examination points will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, Peoples&#39; Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by both State Duma deputies and the Federal Migration Service.
But human rights activists, before the law came into force, many times managed to ask the press in the press: what will it actually give?
What will change the obligation to know the language both for Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, - the representatives of the migration service answer, - this will reduce the number of people suffering from &quot;labor slavery&quot;.
A lot of people are now talking about protecting the rights of labor migrants, explains Viktor Sebelev, head of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems appear among migrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language, who do not have a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, - Sebelev is sure, - the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of help, will stick him in a terrible cramped barrack, where he and dozens of others like him will languish for months without food and documents, injecting 12-14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
&quot;At home they are promised one thing, but upon arrival they are deceived, their passports are taken away, the promised salary is not paid,&quot; confirms Tolib Sharipov, head of the Main Department of Labor Migration of the Ministry of Labor of Tajikistan.
Do not swear, nasyalnik!
Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics who are going to work in Russia, admit that they not only do not know the language of the country they are striving for, but also write with difficulty in their own.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even a sensible primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to even feed their children with, let alone dress them properly, put on shoes and equip them for school.
Growing up to adolescence, such guys go to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if poorly with knowledge of the language, - they admit.
&quot;You feel humiliated and inferior.&quot;
True, with regard to the language law, human rights defenders note one important point.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the migrant workers still live in Russia illegally.
&quot;Welcome, or No Unauthorized Entry&quot;
Many of the newcomers claim that it is not so easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is in bureaucratic obstacles and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be done quickly and for only fifteen hundred.
Russian police officers know that we mostly have fake documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
“They ask for a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea,” a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Khushkadamov shared with journalists.
&quot;Come on, don&#39;t be stingy, buy painting&quot;
On the very first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that not only migrant registration documents are fake.
Several &quot;fake&quot; certificates of passing language tests have already been seized by the FMS.
Counterfeit papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get them for nothing: each of the migrants, hoping in this way to make it easier for themselves the task of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than two times more expensive than the official testing procedure: it will cost a labor migrant three thousand.
The authorities and human rights activists agree that the main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that &quot;crusts&quot; cannot be simply bought.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise migrant workers who have not been able to successfully pass the test the first time, time to study a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
The share of crimes with the use of legal weapons is extremely small
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to tighten the law against the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government&#39;s reaction to recent incidents: Press shots at weddings, when there were no casualties, and the massacre staged by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of traumatics in public places and increase the age from which you can get a license for a weapon - from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments to the law on weapons would be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by &quot;tightening the screws.&quot;
An open letter has appeared on the Internet, the authors of which - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demand that the &quot;senseless tightening&quot; be abandoned.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov told the BBC Russian Service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered with the internal affairs bodies in the six months of 2012, while in total 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not prevent the criminal from going to the &quot;black&quot; market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry claims that they control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The &quot;black&quot; arms market is replenished through several channels.
There are five main such channels, says retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a site that accepts orders for weapons
The first is the &quot;army or military trail&quot;, that is, weapons that were stolen during the hostilities in the Caucasus.
&quot;The weapons were carried by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,&quot; says Baranets.
The next type of &quot;black weapon&quot; is stolen by criminals from representatives of power structures.
Baranets explains that this includes those carried away from police warehouses and those stolen from directly by law enforcement officers.
Illegal &quot;guns&quot; are sold from military warehouses.
Explosions were frequent in many military depots.
&quot;There are proven versions that some of the arson attacks were made on purpose - to cover up the shortage,&quot; says the former military man.
Weapons manufacturers are making their contribution, according to Barantz.
&quot;Now private arms factories are sprouting, which cannot withstand competition on the international market and are throwing weapons out from under the counter onto the black market, including in Moscow,&quot; the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Especially a lot of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
&quot;They have their own production, sometimes handicraft, and a mafia was formed, which organized the flow,&quot; explains the former military man.
Where are the weapons from?
Experts have calculated what is the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this in 2011 was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data from portals on weapons.
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market ended up there &quot;through the fault of the officials whose work involves weapons,&quot; the report said.
According to researchers, 17% of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases theft occurs at the stage of weapons production, 5% falls on &quot;black archeology&quot;.
A sales assistant at one of the weapons stores, who asked not to be named, assures that no one has been buying the weapon found by black diggers for a long time - it is too old.
Most often, he says, sellers go to the military warehouse for a new batch.
Through an ensign, a person buys a unit, for example, a TT pistol.
They write it out for him, pass it over the fence.
&quot;He takes it to the city and sells it here for 900 euros apiece with two shops,&quot; he says.
&quot;True, the police are aware of all the cases, therefore, from time to time, when a plan to solve crimes is burning, they conduct a test purchase from illegal weapons dealers,&quot; the consultant adds.
&quot;Like a luxury store&quot;
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at sites, blogs, until a friend responded, who offered to come to the &quot;Begovaya&quot; platform, where there would be a person who would take me to a &quot;corner&quot; where we would bargain.
I found out the price of the barrel only there
military observer Viktor Baranets
To get the barrel, I need a friend who has a way out, - says the sales assistant. - I have such an acquaintance, but I&#39;m not sure of him.
There are sellers in the markets, but you also need to come there, conditionally, &quot;from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to convey that my daughter&#39;s tooth fell out.&quot;
Now I even get a couple of knuckle dusters through a person in whom I am confident.
He also supplies them only to me, because he knows that I will not hand over it.
Newbies look for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing an article about this for publication.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album of photographs with &quot;anything&quot; in it.
&quot;I felt like I was in a luxury store,&quot; recalls the military man.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered a pig in a poke - everything can be tried.
I, a potential client, do not just buy - we go with the seller to the forest, set a target there.
&quot;They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I am convinced that the weapon hits well, we begin to bargain,&quot; the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the couch
Search engines on the Internet lead to sites and groups in &quot;Vkontakte&quot;, where they offer to buy weapons &quot;for different purposes.&quot;
This does not require any documents or personal meetings.
&quot;It is enough to have a certain amount of money,&quot; they write in an advertising cap on the site &quot;Buy a combat pistol or machine gun.&quot;
On it, users leave their applications and ask questions.
Will they be sold to minors?
&quot;Without a license, of course,&quot; asks the user &quot;Ivan&quot; (spelling saved).
&quot;Buy TT. Moscow&quot; - laconically formulates the request of &quot;Fedorenkov&quot;.
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of dummy websites and are rowing with a shovel who want to buy military weapons.
People go like a hungry fish for bait, and then they mine coal in Siberia
military columnist and former military man Viktor Baranets
I have heard of such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer makes a payment through an ATM.
&quot;In response, they send a photograph and instructions where the weapon is hidden,&quot; says Dmitry Kislov, press secretary of the Right to Arms NGO.
Viktor Baranets claims that by leaving a request on the website, one can remain unarmed and go to jail.
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of dummy websites and are rowing with a shovel who want to buy military weapons.
“People go like a hungry fish for bait, and then they mine coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $ 100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, you can keep within the amount of $ 100 to $ 900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Right to Arms organization, a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $ 100-300.
You will have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the management of these mid-level warehouses.
According to the official statistics of the department, in comparison with January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of revealed facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7 ,eight%.
Fast food and supermarket workers on strike in the US
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers go through work at the McDonald&#39;s checkout.
In recent days, America has seen a wave of protests against low wages at Walmart department stores and popular fast food chains such as McDonald&#39;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendys and Kentucky Fride Chicken.
So far, no one undertakes to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is destined to fizzle out in the early stages.
The actions are supported by trade unions and a number of leftist public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages paid to ordinary Walmart and fast food workers, the protestors aim to create union organizations there.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Promotions began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called &quot;Black Friday&quot;, when America was hit by an orgy of giveaways, which captured millions of ordinary people and sometimes accompanied by scuffles.
On this day, some employees of the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and picketed, along with trade unions and leftist activists, the stores of the corporation, whose goods are designed for people of modest and middle income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in his stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart employees shop only at their place of work.
The availability and range of products have made Walmart one of America&#39;s largest corporations.
Critics say Walmart can afford to sell it cheap, in part because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain about harsh working conditions, such as a shortage of forklift trucks or hand scanners.
Black Friday protesters demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation had jumped from $ 30 to $ 100 a month.
The typical Walmart employee earning $ 9.5 an hour couldn&#39;t afford the expense, they said.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average salary to $ 12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $ 3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than she spends on her salary now.
If Walmart shifts the entire pay rise onto the shoulders of customers, then each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
For the year they will spend some $ 12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters are pleased to note that the protests took place in only nine states and did not cause the slightest damage to the corporation.
Black Friday ran in its stores from 8 pm Thursday to midnight the next day, during which time Walmart was selling about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Corporate spokesman Dan Fogelman argued in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of &quot;fewer than five&quot; Walmart employees have left jobs and that the protest was just &quot;another PR stunt&quot; by the union that organized it.
&quot;Free cash register!&quot;
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart department stores (they are not favored in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), but McDonald&#39;s and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald&#39;s says he sells billions of servings, and after that he doesn&#39;t even give you sick leave or pay you to work honestly!
Jumain Williams, New York City Councilor
Currently, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $ 7.25 an hour.
Fast food restaurants increase it over time, but not much, and on average, their workers in New York make $ 8.90 an hour.
No one earns less than them in this expensive city.
How it is possible to exist in New York on that kind of money is incomprehensible to me.
At one time, almost a quarter of American teenagers passed through the McDonald&#39;s, who worked part-time behind their counters after school, while living with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I constantly come across interviews with McDonald&#39;s employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children with it.
On the other hand, there is a commentary on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them for.
Protesters, which began at 6:30 am Thursday morning at McDonald&#39;s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food chefs start paying at least $ 15 an hour, more than doubling it. the current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be formed in the fast food industry.
US law prohibits administrations from obstructing this and punishing union activists with nagging and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is difficult for a union to embrace fast food for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary staff turnover.
Dissenting
Noisy protests took place that day at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The action culminated in a mid-afternoon rally outside McDonald&#39;s near Times Square, at which several local Democratic politicians spoke, including City Councilor Jumain Williams, who said: McDonald&#39;s says it sells billions of servings, and after that he doesn&#39;t even give you sick leave or pay you to work honestly! &quot;
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that “we must stand together in support of fast food workers so that they achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every new -Yorkie! &quot;
As the New York Times described the incident, it was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, and not all of them were workers in the fast food service, which employs tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear if this spark will spark the flames of a mass movement.
&quot;So far, deceiving the brain is average.&quot;
Recently, it is customary to perceive the topic of augmented reality, which is popular among fans of modern technologies, mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First, Google showed the current model at its annual conference in the summer, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had also filed an application for the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies at the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft, Sharam Izadi, it follows that for the scientists of this company, glasses are a passed stage.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Please tell us in general terms what your research group is doing?
- We deal with human interaction with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity en masse is stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes poking a finger at them.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and predict radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is sold without the Kinect, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else is ahead of us?
“Even though Kinect has brought interaction to the physical level, a lot still happens on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system is receiving more data), but the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
It is necessary to release the computer world into our physical world, to make it more tangible.
To do this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
Popular stuff, but isn&#39;t it overrated?
- It definitely cannot be called a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because you don&#39;t always want to inform others about your actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but each in its own niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not over sweeping ones, but over such mean, short ones.
At the same time, the gestures were filmed not with the device&#39;s camera, but with a wrist bracelet, which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
While it is large, in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future belongs to a mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- What is it like?
“For example, how do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You will say and show at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot at the moment?
- Not at all necessary, but this is mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will mainly have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately determine human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, this is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Lacking resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what we can build on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps.
But the point is not in the megapixels themselves, but in the quality of the matrix and depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorithm designers.
That is, you need to remember not only about the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also the Z.
Also very important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 fps is frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmond laboratory made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100 ms, and modern serial sensors are closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
In my work, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful to me, only it does not require touches, so that there are more frames per second.
- Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three &quot;cameras&quot;, one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the other is an echo receiver.
And now the third camera is, in fact, an ordinary sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of an object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem ...
Or aggravate it by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog of the Kinect, play around with the curvature of the cameras and see how this helps in 3D positioning.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don&#39;t you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, it&#39;s not very convenient to walk around all the time, holding a smartphone in raised hands, but here&#39;s what I think: the coolest option would be &quot;rolling&quot; augmented reality, when on the basis of a cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display and then everywhere.
Glasses are a very personal device, this is their strength (only you can see private things), and at the same time their weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let&#39;s imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from &quot;Iron Man&quot;, but also to a mere mortal.
There is one problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tactile feedback!
Hands don&#39;t feel anything!
What responses is your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is using the second hand as a kind of background for the image.
She perfectly registers clicks!
But there are technologies that are really aimed at making these &quot;pictures in the air&quot; tangible - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic beams at a certain point where the finger is located gives a sensation, but so far it is very weak - as if you were blown on the pads.
There are also wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think that he feels what he supposedly should feel at the moment when he sees something?
- This is a good idea, we have not tried it yet.
Here lies another task that has to be fought for a long time to come - how to make a person who is physically in a very limited space believe that he is walking along an open, almost infinite - we are also working on the concepts of treadmills (not at all like in clubs) , moving platforms, and huge balls.
While deceiving the brain turns out to be average, there is still a lot of work for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to the researcher - many things are absolutely rudimentary.
Vkusovschina instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the Petersburg Avant-garde project, dedicated to the townspeople who are in the forefront, at the forefront of culture and art.
This top list has already included prominent figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the outrageous artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man dressed in all red, who can be found at the Russian Museum, at the Summer Garden, at fashionable parties and opening days.
Kirill Miller&#39;s paintings always attract crowds of spectators, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely Petersburg social and philosophical storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, his appearance on the streets makes the townspeople smile, cheers everyone up.
Recently, he picked up a hurdy-gurdy and became a St. Petersburg organ-grinder, as he was ripe for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you still walk around the city in all red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a fashion designer dealing with look and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between artist, image maker and society.
Although in society everything that is almost gray causes aggression and arousal of an unkind nature.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- When did you realize that you should be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the Palace of Culture Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that this is my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and new, free ones like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonevism, which led to &quot;Pushkinskaya-10&quot;, and there was no more wave.
I am thrown into the theater, clothes, music, in all genres, except for the word.
- And all this came together in your Art Clinic ... - It was important for me to find myself in the center of Petersburg culture, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I occupied the territory on Pushkinskaya-10, and there, while there was no renovation, there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, a house of St. Petersburg bohemia.
Many were born there: NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I remember how Shnur was brought with the project &quot;Van Gogh&#39;s Ear&quot;.
Cord and his friends sang light songs under plywood, they were in tight leotards, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band started playing live, it became &quot;Leningrad&quot;.
Trachtenberg hosted many programs until Hali-Galiv times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went, and he received a basic education and upbringing from us.
Gallery &quot;D 137&quot;, club &quot;Griboyedov - these are echoes of the Art Clinic.
Our workers and patrons went there.
I am a hero of yesterday, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was &quot;People of our city&quot;.
In the nomination &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; I was named, my culmination ended.
In new times, according to the old rules, it is uncomfortable to work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
It is easy to become popular these days, but culture and popularity are separate, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a pronounced relevance and sharpness.
I will have a program exhibition, &quot;Russian Museum in Clowns&quot;.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now to be like that is painful and scary.
But in the clowns everything is smeared, the tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through totalitarian dressing up in an orderly manner.
Now they are greeted by their clothes, focusing on the external mechanics, and not on the inner person.
Or maybe you can&#39;t give him a hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by dressing up.
- And recently we saw you in the role of the city organ grinder. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me, should be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Nowadays commercial art should be neat, tactful, sweet.
The disintegration of cultures is going on.
Previously, people huddled in flocks, bohemians loved one thing, simpletons another.
Now everyone has broken up into microcommunities, now it&#39;s hard for everyone to like it.
I&#39;m not a hundred dollar bill for everyone to like.
Now you need to think about who will like you.
Now each iconic hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand come to Stas Mikhailov!
- Brothels come to him, there the sex-social sphere works.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, but 10 thousand will not come, and as a result, less management, less money, everything is wasting away.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what they have acquired.
In my youth, I painted such pictures that one collector had them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with the usually finished pictures.
Now the concepts are often confused.
They say: spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, this is from another opera.
I am a man of yesterday&#39;s culture, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, gave up money to paint pictures.
I am for this kind of culture.
- Kirill, what is St. Petersburg lacking?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: an official from culture.
But not all of them can engage in culture.
With the right kings, everything was not so, the kings, perhaps, did not really understand the culture, but they understood that they needed to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are pushed aside, since we need higher experts who will correctly assess these experts and give them a path.
Nowadays taste is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that we do not accept all contemporary art, there are such artists who should look for other museums.
- What is Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is soil there.
And it is difficult for art to grow on our stones.
We need cultural soil, and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have a thin layer.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was funded by a grant from St. Petersburg
Give birth in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board set off in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question arises, how to continue your race in zero gravity or on the same spare planet?
I think there is little choice.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
&quot;This is Venus and Mars,&quot; says a senior researcher at the P.K. Sternberg (GAISH) Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus ... in space.
The approach to the issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
Experiments on plants were carried out half a century ago.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then - the introduction into orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies-fruit flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to test how the embryo develops in zero gravity.
We get an absolutely normal chick at the exit.
But then the problem begins.
&quot;The problem is that this chick must find support, it must stand on its own legs and start moving,&quot; explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP), Russian Academy of Sciences.
Not finding support, the chicks tumbled randomly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to light and sound.
And the trouble there was that after four days they simply died.
&quot;And twice we hatched chicks, after that we refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there,&quot; Vladimir Sychev states the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last time a biological &quot;minicheg&quot; flew into orbit with animals was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, experiments will continue.
However, there will be only same-sex individuals on the Bion biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space with a fetus.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found there.
&quot;It was just on biosatellites, but again, this is a single experiment, and such studies should be carried out,&quot; says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
But it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
Not an easy task.
Animals, losing their habitual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
A man, unlike animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkova had the greatest risk.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could have said whether it would survive after the flight into space.
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight.
&quot;After all, no one answered this question,&quot; says Vakhtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the space flight, the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child&#39;s father, Andriyan Nikolaev, was also an astronaut.
In 1988, the second woman-cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice visited orbit and even worked in outer space, had a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, there are only a few cosmonauts who, after long flights, have all worked out, and a healthy generation is growing.
&quot;And if more, then it is dangerous even during orbital flights&quot;, - sums up the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK hydro laboratory is an obligatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here, in conditions of zero buoyancy, astronauts practice their skills in open space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for adults water, albeit a comfortable, but still alien environment, for infants it is a native element.
Small ichthyandras seem to confirm that life on land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months with the mother in the amniotic fluid, it is easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bathing, only 2 weeks pass.
“It’s very little to forget something,” says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a born child, then gravity, gravity is necessary for a woman.
Very quickly, in zero gravity, the muscles of the abdomen and pelvis become decrepit, the ability to push the fetus decreases.
Okay, let&#39;s omit this too, relying on stimulants of labor.
You can, of course, go to the childbirth in a special cell, she will push him out.
&quot;What next?&quot; - Valery Polyakov asks non-trivial questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling gravity, the body will not form the skeleton and muscular system.
Like an adult, it is impossible to dress a newborn in orbit in a special training suit.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
&quot;And this experiment, which we will go to, allowing the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring a disabled, completely maladapted person to Earth,&quot; foresees Igor Pestov, head of the IBMP RAS Bioethics Committee.
While the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while it will become a reality, when earthlings on their ships will go to a distant planet, which will become home for their descendants born in space.
Head of the Main Audit Office: The check of the Schwarz system failed due to the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite having good quality legislation, lags behind in its implementation.
This is the statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
&quot;The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack,&quot; Kala commented on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are provided by the joint inspection of the Czech and German control authorities.
The approach of Petr Nechas to the so-called Schwarz-system is cited as an example of wrong practice.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with inspections - is it prohibited or allowed?
&quot;The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, then the prime minister cannot resist the work of the institutions that are charged with checking and enforcing obligations,&quot; says Kala.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, within the framework of which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
This refers to a parallel check that we started probably two years ago.
Simply put, we are talking about the fact that European legislation states how public procurement should take place, followed by national legislation and then also application in practice.
All the information was collected and, even with an unfinished verification, interesting differences were discovered - in other words, our legislation can be &quot;accurate and error-free&quot;, but in practice, we are inferior to Germany in some parameters.
It follows from this that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this kind of joint oversight that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, and the reduction and improvement of restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it is not a fact that we will achieve this by reducing the restriction of orders.
Perhaps this system will overflow with &quot;papers&quot; so that those who wish to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the restriction had not been reduced.
You are talking about internal problems of the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there such an organization as our KRU (Audit Office) or does it work differently?
As for the institutions, there Bundesrechnungshof acts as our KRU, organized according to our principle, there is also a collegium that works a little differently, but basically both institutions function in the same way.
In addition, the powers are to a certain extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the federal state level - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have government funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounting chambers.
As for local legislation, is it easier there than ours?
In general, I would not want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but one cannot definitely say that it is better in everything.
Is this because they are better at controlling?
Definitely not, but again, I don&#39;t like such comparisons.
But I must say that even model countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn&#39;t be getting any benefit from working with our office, right?
If we talk about domestic legislation, how did the amendments to the Public Procurement Law affect your institution, are the consequences manifested in some way?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet manifested itself in any way in our control work.
Since we are conducting ex-post control, some delay must be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future audits - we began to use our new tool &quot;uneconomic risk detection&quot;, through which we ran almost 14,000 government contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will manifest themselves, because the restrictions change, the conditions of some types of tenders change, and so on.
Do you think the adoption of this law will bring benefits or additional burden on the bureaucratic system?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope this will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will become &quot;stricter&quot; and cannot be followed.
Under the previous rules, controlled enterprises are tied to the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the public procurement law means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth it, in this case, to tighten the law in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let us be aware that this path will lead nowhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the State Traffic Police will not bother entrepreneurs with checks on the so-called Schwarz system. What does it mean?
Is the &quot;Schwarz system&quot; prohibited or allowed?
The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, then the prime minister cannot resist the work of the bodies, which are charged with the duty of checking and enforcing the fulfillment of obligations.
You can say, &quot;We will change this law and allow this,&quot; but you cannot say that we will pretend that nothing is happening.
The Public Procurement Law contains quite strict rules on how and what should be formally carried out, and rightly so. This will protect government procurement.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
The roads are slippery in places, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowy.
Mostly they are passable, but here and there with more caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning in the Karlovy Vary Region the roads were passable, but in some places they were frozen and snowy.
The temperature has dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but should be getting a little warmer during the day.
Snowfall in the region has stopped, only a small layer lies in the lowlands.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
From information received from regional road workers, it became known that there was lower visibility in places due to fog.
The R6 expressway and first class roads in the region are currently passable without restrictions.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third class, including mountain tracks, are passable.
But in some of their areas, there are still remnants of frozen and in places worn snow.
You need to be especially careful on the roads located on the hills.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
The Czech Republican Roads and Highways Authority informs on its Internet pages that some roads in Eastern Bohemia are threatened with ice, and mountain roads and roads located on hills may have a worn-out layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers about ice slicker, which can form especially in the uplands of the Pardubice region.
Ice may be near Lanškroun, Usti nad Orlici, Polička, Svitaví or Visoké Mito, especially on second and third class roads.
Roads I / 43 and I / 34, located near Svitavi, have been treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of the Giant Mountains and the Orlické Mountains.
A worn-out layer of snow is found on the roads located on the hills in the regions of Rychnova nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia, it is partly cloudy without precipitation.
Temperatures usually range from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Pilsen region
The roads in the Pilsen Region are passable this morning, but in some places you need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
It is frosty in the morning, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, it can be slippery in some places.
Drivers may experience fog in places, but visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
The D5 highway is now virtually passable, however road managers recommend caution between kilometers 80 and 131.
Most first class roads have dry and frozen surfaces.
In southern Plze and Tachov, frozen areas can be found.
The roads of the second and third class are wet, and also in this case there is a warning in connection with the possibility of the appearance of slippery areas.
Drivers must be careful, especially on little-used roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the hills of the Olomouc Region must take into account the snow on the road today.
She remained after the application of chemicals in the Chervenogorsk saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlsky Kříž.
At night, snowfall forced road workers to go out into the street, according to information from the road administration, about three centimeters of snow fell in Šumperk.
In other areas, road edges are generally passable without restrictions.
&quot;Remains of snow lie on the hills of Sumperk.
Drivers heading in the direction of Jeseník should bear in mind the presence of snow in the Chervenogorsk saddle, ”the dispatcher of the Šumperk road administration told ČAN (Czech News Agency) today.
At night, their colleagues from Jeseník also went to clear the roads, they assured that the roads on the hills after the treatment with chemicals remained bare and wet.
In Olomouc, the roads are passable without restrictions, but in Sternberk, drivers must be careful in forest areas where moisture is still present.
Stí nad Labem Region, Liberec Region
Road workers from northern Bohemia report this morning that there are some difficult-to-pass areas left.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with icy or snowfall, a mountain road in the section from Telnice to Klinice in the stí Region is closed.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. On the contrary, in the lowlands, especially to the southeast of the Bohemian Midlands, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
No traffic complications have been reported yet.
Road workers report icy conditions in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - it rained and snowed all day, the sky cleared at night and frosts began.
Unfavorable conditions are reported on the main highways and on the I / 13 road at the border of stí nad Labem and Liberec Region.
Due to the branches of trees bent under a layer of snow, touching the road itself, the road in Telnice on Kninitsa was closed.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is just one of the many unsettling news that we humans get caught up in so easily.
Together with The Tap Tap, we constantly joke about this topic and say that we are the only group in the world that can muster enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell the readers more about this?
This is a nationwide fundraising event that we have been planning for two years now.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which was announced to end on December 21 at 11:10 am.
The day before this event, on December 20th at 21:00, three concerts will start in parallel in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, at the moment when the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially, it was my idea, then we came up with everything together with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state of this world we will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be bought on the website www.e-tap.cz and thereby support us at the same time.
The Tap Tap, along with other musicians, also sang a anti-doomsday anthem called &quot;End of the World Canceled&quot;.
Will the already beloved YouTube anthem be played at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if in the end everything works out and the end of the world does not come.
It will be sung by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
The hymns will also be played simultaneously live on Czech television.
The lyrics to this song were written and played the role of Jesus in the video by Tomasz Hanak, he also participates in the performance of Xindl X ...
How did you start working with them?
We also collaborate with other personalities of Czech cultural life, as we organize many charity events and concerts.
We are trying to actively involve them in these projects.
It turned out that many people like working with us, they are interested.
Where will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go?
For the purchase of equipment for the STUDEO barrier-free educational center, for the sixth year we have been working this way with the civic association Tap at the Jedlichki Institute.
The teachers regularly visit the students of the schools of the Jedlichki Institute and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we try in this way to provide them with this opportunity.
As part of the project for the additional construction of the Jedlichki Institute, a separate building will appear in the future, into which we will move with this project.
Several music groups and performers will perform at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marjan Bango and Jiri Sukhi will perform in Prague.
All details can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such &quot;big events&quot; in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring festival and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would love to perform at the Czech National House in New York, and personally, if we are in the United States, I would very much like to perform in Washington and Chicago.
As for the foreign countries, you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with the road in terms of organization and logistics ??
This is not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs must travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large amount of cargo and toolboxes.
Nevertheless, so far they have coped with this without problems. Czech Airlines ČSA and British Airways British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, which surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to traveling abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything functions better than ours, in Russia we have witnessed that in the east it is still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are a lot of barriers in Moscow, and here it is still a novelty for a person to move independently in an electric wheelchair in the city center.
Also, there are no such banal things as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator.
Fortunately, public organizations are already emerging there that are trying to draw people&#39;s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what, on the contrary, do we constantly have to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are so many things that are far behind the level of performance.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people who are concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite normal that people with severe disabilities move independently on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, and anywhere ...
It is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we with The Tap Tap are a little ahead of them!
Respect for the public or disability is one thing, but the moment famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers appear among us, then everything really starts to change.
So far, these are isolated cases - people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but going back two years, what made you organize it in 1998?
I entered the Jedlichka Institute as an educator, there were many young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician myself and I also play the saxophone, together with a colleague I organized an interesting music club.
Well, over time, as our presenter Ladya Angelovich says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
Popularity has come only in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It’s true, it helped that we started joining famous singers and actively promoting the group.
We came to the conclusion that work that no one can appreciate, in fact, does not seem to exist.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to promote The Tap Tap so well?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
Showbiz is full of things that imitate one another.
This is logical, everything new is accepted with caution, and it lasts for a long time.
There are very few rare things out there, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, is pity, this is natural ...
But this pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not some kind of suffering and all the abandoned individuals that we should feel sorry for.
They are people who can live a fulfilling life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities do something, it is a shift not only for them, but for the whole society.
Has it been successful that you are the strict leader that many believe you are?
If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that&#39;s okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they very quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But this happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many were there at the beginning in 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We are an open group, people come and go, it cannot be prevented.
For those who have desire and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 12/20/2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba stadium, in Brno at the Fléda club and Ostrava at the Plynojem center with the participation of 12 bands and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a teleconference at the time of the performance of The Tap Tap&#39;s song &quot;The End of the World Is Canceled&quot;.
The aim of this project is to raise funds in the amount of 25 million kroons for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational center at the Jedlichki Institute in Prague.
A ticket to the concert costs 400 CZK, for children under 12 years old admission is free. Tickets can be bought in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the following years took an active part in a number of agency projects.
But Poland began its journey to outer space much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights, but this was not always met with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, of the lecture of A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work &quot;Introduction to Cosmonautics&quot; at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Peltry and André Louis Hirsch Prize for &quot;Introduction to Cosmonautics&quot;.
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a well-known world propagandist of cosmonautics, and his contribution was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railroad car equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket should have been used to accelerate or decelerate the cart.
Information about this railcar is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about rocket arrows.
The research was carried out by the Weapons Technology Section in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzycki.
From the surviving materials, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, work was interrupted.
In 1937, an idea for a photoelectric fighter-rocket appeared in a specialized press, which was proposed by engineer Rogozinsky, and the following year the work &quot;Air torpedo missile and aircraft missile-bomb&quot; by the author Leliva-Kzhivoblotsky was published.
Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were dealt with by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of its activity, the work ended due to the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work on astronautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the society was mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal &quot;Problems&quot;, which publishes four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that would deal with astronautics.
At that time, projects of artificial satellites were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
From the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (POA) tried to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and in the fall, the POA became its full member.
And the next year, the first chairman of the PAA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in this position until his death, which occurred in 1959.
Since 1956, the POA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile, capable of covering a distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, a two-stage RM-2 rocket was tested in the Bledovsky wasteland.
This rocket was about 1.4 m long and weighs about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could cover 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high-altitude wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm, and its initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the chamber for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 liters, the Meteor-1B - 0.34 liters, and the Meteor-1C - 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight range for all three types was 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was being developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a launch weight of 380 kg was capable of launching a payload weighing 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland&#39;s accession to COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Abolishing the public works law is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, a constitutional court overturned the public works law.
The resolution caused a lively discussion in the society.
Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at this problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of the significant difference in the cost of labor (wages), there is price tension.
This concept should be understood as a state when a manufacturer, by delivering a cheap product, tries to withstand economic competition by &quot;knocking down&quot; the cost of a competitor in order to take a large part of the market for himself and, thus, increase his own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either the transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result, unemployment rises in countries where labor costs are high compared to others.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including for the unemployment it produces, the inevitable government spending on social needs is growing.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social economic and social damage caused by them in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
The unceremonious methods of private capital create situations at the level of the economies of individual states when the governments of countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments leave their own populations to the mercy of private capital, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the current legislation.
The goal is to economically force their people to submit to the dictates of private capital, primarily in the area of ​​wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool to curtail the rights of workers in the field of labor law.
As a result, the level of poverty increases, and with it the gap between the poor and the rich.
For several years in the FRG there has been a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constantly cases when employed people receive such a salary that the state must pay them extra in order for them to receive a living wage.
A similar scandal became known to the public in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people, under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status, are forced either to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to live on a beggarly salary in the margins of society. in the hope that someday private investment capital will come to the country.
However, the question is, where does it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still work for a share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media adamantly argue that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not interfere with the economy by managing its actions.
The next question to be answered is whether private capital, now practically managing politics and the very whole state, is not acting for its own selfish purposes?
The unequivocal answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of almost omnipotent and omnipresent lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation, manifested in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits, in legislation, where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that state ministries, due to a lack of financial resources, entrust the development of draft laws to private law firms that are closely associated with industry.
Then these bills are approved by the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as the Western-type constitution says, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly finding itself in such a situation, as described by Appian in the work &quot;The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompey&quot;: &quot;The state has long been disintegrating, and the departments are engaged in violence.
Bribery, illegal receipt of favors with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to the polls with a pre-sold vote &quot;&quot; ... decent people did not run for the post of ruler at all, in the end, one day the state was left without a consul for eight months &quot;..&quot; to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need to choose an energetic person &quot;.. Appian thought it would be Pompey, but Caesar became him, who finally changed democracy to autocracy.
As in ancient times, modern society is dominated by its own reckless interests without regard to public interests.
Private capital is no longer inherently intended for public use.
The current result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to introduce deeper reforms.
This means that we should look for the reason for the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal type of democracy can be perceived as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and modern history.
Canceling the public works law is not a solution, or at least not permanently.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus, this trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the share of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in governing the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
&quot;Nothing will come of violence, and it can never come out&quot; - Sting, song &quot;Fragile&quot;, where the main verse of the refrain is the words: &quot;do not forget how fragile we are.&quot;
&quot;If my sons did not want wars, they would not exist&quot; - the dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Meer Amschel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has generated a lot of responses.
Some support Israel, arguing its position by the fact that it has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the Israeli state is attributed the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to speculate about who is the perpetrator and who is the victim in these recurring waves of murder, after all, today&#39;s citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and did not witness the outbreak of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to look at who is primarily served by the tension that has lasted for 95 years (counting from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is, first of all, the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people always completely independently took their steps, or someone stood behind their throne who directed their actions towards predetermined goals.
It should be assumed that we live in a period when the world&#39;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that flows from it could not have occurred in the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically wealthy families, one stands out, which could be considered as the head of an octopus (I do not know if someone is standing above them, but this is not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
They don&#39;t write much about them.
Of course.
They bought the first news agency (Reuters) already in the 90s of the 19th century in order to stop rumors connecting their name with criminal actions in the higher spheres, in the shadow of which they were, and which always led to strengthening their power, increasing wealth, or at the same time and to that, and to another.
They have large stakes in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their shares, they are waging or preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi, only four remained, but at the same time, the Russian government took over its country&#39;s central bank).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain central bank status with the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began issuing his own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 at the theater.
John F. Kennedy started issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal Reserve System), was assassinated in 1963. MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for unleashing the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their lust for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars, created by the great 33rd level Mason Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was to destroy monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial rule, especially Great Britain, and the third should lead to a reduction in the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (this number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury , and they will not consume many resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything other than a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method used by a group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, is to challenge a crisis and then offer solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these decisions are bogus and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the founding of the FED, which was to prevent a repeat of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War through the assassination of the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia, starting the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy tsarist Russia) and, as a result, the Central European power, Austria-Hungary, was fragmented.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, bankers and politicians created a latent conflict situation, imposing huge war reparations on Germany, which created the preconditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then all that remained was to give the Germans a strong enough leader, denouncing the guilty and offering simple solutions, and then creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which had to play, and indeed played the function of the fifth column, in kindling the fire of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds instigated the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the preconditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began to take place.
Terrorist attacks have occurred from both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke free from the chains in which he was initially held by the bankers, or everything he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by the war reparations in World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a third seat of war.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will become a victim of hostilities on the front lines, now together with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only domestically, but also internationally (just take the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like ours, international bankers slip only their own candidates to people to vote in elections.
The current prime minister of Israel, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist politician loyal to international bankers, doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran&#39;s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten escalate into a global conflict, and given Iran&#39;s control over the Strait of Hormuz, which contains 20% of the world&#39;s oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994: &quot;All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order.&quot;
The new world order in their view is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocrats enjoying the comfort.
A world where every born organism is implanted with a chip at birth, with which it becomes a being under total control.
&quot;And he forces all small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have a brand on their right hand or on their forehead, so that a person who is not marked with the name of that beast, or the number of its name, could neither buy nor sell.
This is the wisdom: anyone with intelligence can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to a human name, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.
&quot;Operation Argo&quot; Movie: When Worse, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist student demonstrators seized the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the ousted Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, which had been his regime&#39;s patron for decades.
For the US administration, a positive outcome of the situation was not expected - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because this could fundamentally undermine the confidence of the allies in other countries.
However, she was unable to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The defeat in Iran largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, &quot;Operation Argo&quot; describes one of the episodes in the story that brought America&#39;s small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After difficult twists and turns, they ended their journey at the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them out of Iran, with the help of an extravagant cover legend, according to which they left with Canadian passports as members of a film crew looking for a location in the country for filming a sci-fi epic.
Combination of genres
The plan, which was devised by &quot;evacuation&quot; expert Tony Mendes, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend true, specialized magazines wrote about the film&#39;s project, held press conferences, and a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Affleck&#39;s film is a special blend of several genres.
On the one hand, there is a real political thriller, the so-called &quot;film-pop&quot;, the story of a successful venture, a swindle - an example is a number of films about Ocean&#39;s friends.
Moods are constantly changing in the film - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the credits show iconic historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lightweight Hollywood clips intersecting with irony and mild exaggeration.
And then more scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in suits discussing the situation at the conference tables, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck did a wonderful job restarting his career.
From a ridiculed actor he became a respected director, and his acting ceased to be an object of ridicule.
&quot;Operation Argo&quot; is his third feature film, after the dark detective &quot;Goodbye, Baby, Goodbye&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;City&quot; (2010).
At the same time, this is Affleck&#39;s first film not filmed in the director&#39;s hometown, Boston.
The sense of the ambience of the place, however, refers to qualities that elevated the director&#39;s earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in “Argo”, where Tehran “plays” Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, reenactments of real events - the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy are impressive in their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when a story suddenly changes somewhere.
Affleck and his colleagues achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake headquarters in a Tehran bazaar).
There are too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He works quite successfully with this few, sometimes he comes up with something - it all comes out not so elegantly (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents an impending crisis at Tehran airport, and the runway chase looks rather far-fetched).
The disadvantage of &quot;Argo&quot; is the distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are indeed very charming as their Hollywood colleagues, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck&#39;s film lacks a bit of drama, it is a film that can be watched with moderate interest, appreciating the production and retro style that recreates the thrillers of the seventies.
But it captures with difficulty.
However, this is enough to remind about one, still in a certain sense, living history, as well as to testify to how exaggerated the idea of an omnipotent and all-knowing intelligence services.
Balloon rules, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce a competition for &quot;the most absurd regulation or project from the EU workshop.&quot;
“We were prompted to do this by the latest event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,” the organizer of the survey, Patrick Nager, told Pravu.
Among the absurdities already nominated for the nomination is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify the rate of insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, women have had life insurance benefits because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
“Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop people can put forward for the competition before the end of this year.
The voting itself will take place until the end of February 2013, &quot;Nager said.
Controversial EU directives include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which as a result is harmful to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of a chicken cage. as a result of which this year eggs have risen in price significantly.
Also criticized was the de facto ban on the use of the term &quot;sandwich butter&quot; or the withdrawal from the sale of classic light bulbs.
Good quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under pressure from one or another trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by some state or group of states (thus, the Czech Republic now, even under threat of veta, defends the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, the highest quality bananas in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show &quot;anomalous curvature&quot;.
At the same time, the European Commission justified itself by the fact that it was only harmonizing the existing disparate national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some states, has nevertheless relaxed the standards regarding fruits and vegetables, citing the fact that the existing directives will lead to waste of products.
Last year&#39;s EU regulation, according to which sold balloons must be warned that children under eight cannot inflate them without adult supervision, may also be a candidate for winning the poll.
The EU turned to US research that balloons play as a potential cause of death by suffocation in children.
A similar restriction now applies to children under the age of 14, who are forbidden to blow on fairground pipes.
Funny ideas are born at home too
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is also quite absurd: everyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the delicacy of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, but must instead say &quot;FYROM&quot; (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) ...
The Bankovnípoplatky.com portal, in collaboration with the Laissez Faire, an association of liberal economists, proposed for voting, in addition to the above-mentioned absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food reserves that can be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for the fact that they do not have a sea, and the idea of providing subsidies for applications for subsidies.
But these ideas originated in Prague, not Brussels.
“We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation, &quot;said the then Minister of Agriculture Yaroslav Palace (CSDP) in the fall of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses of stocks that needed to be removed.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic halfway by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
Subsidies for receiving subsidies were offered to villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Pavel Nemets (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to go to the preparation of an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Fancy orders are an exception
While regulations in member states are easily criticized, the EU&#39;s efforts to regulate and to better function and develop the EU are, in the opinion of many experts, deserving of recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the scooping of EU subsidies for projects that do not even have a hint of anything to do with deepening European integration, but which the member states achieved when discussing the budget.
It also evokes emotions among Czechs that, like in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, retained the name &quot;Olomouc cheese&quot;, however, &quot;Tuzemsky rum&quot;, whose traditions in our country go back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename to &quot;Tuzemak&quot;.
Only products made from cane distillate, not from sugar beets, can be called rum.
Along with the world famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma ham, the official list of EU registered products includes, for example, Karlovy Vary rusks, Pogorzelice and Třeboонь carp and atec hops.
Pardubice gingerbread and mustache rolls can also be proud of the EU trademark.
People want me to protect the republic, but I&#39;m an amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does it occur to a person to run for president?
I don&#39;t think about becoming a senator or president myself.
If everything in our country functioned without problems, then I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch how over the past 20 years the country has been plundered, how thieves are scurrying around here, people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don&#39;t like, I try to find a solution to how to change it.
And since I am already forty years old and I am an independent person who does not belong to any party, I have no other opportunity to influence things except to run for Senator or President.
You got into the Senate, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Are you turning your back on the people who chose you in this way?
All the time I said that I would join the fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later I clarified that if I am elected as a senator, I will run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool with which I can fulfill my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the broadest authority.
But the difficulty is not only that we, as a nation, grumble in our bar or in front of the TV, but at the same time we are ready to trample anyone who tries to change something.
Added to this are the media, which denigrate a person, and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, they said about me that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an advisor to Jiri Paroubek.
Let&#39;s move on to your views.
You started the fight for the presidential castle with theses on the material and criminal liability of politicians and on reverse property declarations worth over twenty million.
To do this, it is necessary to change the law.
You, as president, do not have such powers, and only the whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied for excursions to become a free enterprise, it was promoted.
The problem is politicking - when someone comes with a good offer from the left or from the right, they deliberately obstruct him, and this holds back the citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan person, I have a much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it, without sorting it out on the shelves, without looking back at the dogmas.
Do you consider yourself a more right-wing or left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people class me more as a leftist.
For me it doesn&#39;t matter at all - a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for me that we move forward.
The point is not that someone belongs to the right, but someone to the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any decision that is good for society, whether it is proposed by the HRCM or the State Democratic Party, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you are a populist.
But don&#39;t you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And you are trying to get closer to this.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already functioning in the world, or prominent experts are talking about them.
But without the support of parliament, you will only be left with slogans.
And with this in politics, you will not last long.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to implement criminal and financial liability?
I have no other option.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them over to our side so that we can achieve our goal.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I will appeal to the chairmen of parliamentary parties with an appeal to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in case of refusal, will have to tell why they do not want it.
If there is a strong personality who will voice the abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was the merit of pressure from the public.
I say directly that I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am just a beginner in politics and for my program I will try to get majority support.
I try to promote things on my own; if this fails, I will finish in six years and return to the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I&#39;m not any savior.
I know that I alone will not do anything, so I bypassed a number of famous people with a proposal to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchura, he refused due to the large amount of work.
I also at least supported the investigative journalist Yana Lorentsova, who uncovered the light fuel oil fraud.
I nominated myself because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel like I&#39;m on the scales.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and the majority of those who went elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two of us independent in the Senate.
The people chose the Senate so that change would be difficult.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about starting your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to check the purity of the past of every potential supporter, and I don’t have the money to do it.
There is no money for the presidential campaign either; I have only twenty thousand crowns on my transparent account.
Don&#39;t have money?
You are talking about property declarations, but what about your own affairs with that?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, an art collection for about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb for a million, and a few million more. on the account.
By the way, I got Aston Martin because it was my boyish dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove by car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, own $ 60 million in property and have no money for the campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
This is not very convincing.
I don&#39;t have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I go into debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors indicates that my program is not that interesting.
And I am not obliged to pay for the election campaign out of my own pocket.
The campaign expenses will essentially be covered by the senator&#39;s salary.
But I would not live on this money, for example, I could not pay my son for an English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I would not run anywhere.
So, then you will be engaged in entrepreneurship so that you can live?
Didn&#39;t you say that you will cut back on this activity?
But this does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activity.
For example, my deputy will become the managing director of a travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be the unmercenary who will keep the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I continue to receive.
And if I became president, then my business would be finished.
The full interview can be found in the Saturday issue of the Pravo newspaper.
MVRDV architects prove that real adventures are not only in the imagination - with Speikenisse and his newly built Book Mountain as an example - 2 photos
“I find this building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally we can see something interesting again,” says Lisette Verheig, a passer-by at the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, says: &quot;No, this building is really beautiful.&quot;
But I ask myself: why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad, and e-books.
Nowadays, no one volunteers to go to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Speikenisse, an unremarkable bedroom town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest educational level in the Netherlands.
To combat this annoying circumstance, several years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely painted reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And then the city fathers realized that they had the only opportunity to overcome statistics: to build a library here!
Winnie Maas of the MVRDV architecture firm in Rotterdam, a master of bold bar charts and author of witty, sometimes even cynical constructions, took the task with his usual equanimity and appeared at the competitive audition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the members of the jury looked around in bewilderment and shrugged their shoulders, the impudent Maas folded a pyramid in size from his original gift and ended his speech in defense of his project with the following words: &quot;Dear citizens!&quot;
This is my proposal: &quot;Book Mountain&quot; in Speikeniss, the so-called Buckenberg!
Nine years later, this 30 million euro mountain has grown.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential buildings and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, &quot;Book Mountain&quot; was awarded the second prize in the &quot;Best Library of the Netherlands 2012&quot; competition.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch national timber construction competition.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which previously could offer nothing but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall, whose white facades suggest a dairy, has become richer by one modern piece of architecture.
But the most important thing is that the first public cultural building in the history of this town appeared in Speikeniss.
Long road to the book
First impression: a bookish Eldorado under a cheese hood.
There is only one elevator in the center of the mountain range, because true fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
Glazed on all sides, the space is bright and easy to see, with baked brick floors and elegant street lamps that unmistakably create the feeling of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfectly recreated.
The look involuntarily searches for benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
&quot;Usually there are bookshelves along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark room, usually uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic space configuration upside down and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The interior space of the Book Mountain is skillfully used: in the center there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical rooms.
Particularly pleasing are the black bookshelves, which serve as wall decoration, parapets, or stair railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and civil engineers are at a loss as to what this unknown material is.
“We were keen to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trauborst, project manager for the Speikenisse community, in line with the standard.
And once, at an agricultural enterprise in Friesland, we came across a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands have been using millimeter-thick synthetic fiber material as root liners.
It&#39;s cheap and time-saving.
Thin textiles last one or two seasons, after which they can be thrown away.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was pressed into panels four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called landbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material that smells a bit like a new car and a little sneakers.
105 steps lead to the top.
Anyone who overcomes the path of almost 500 meters will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted tree figs.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the correct air humidity on the literary mountain.
The cost of a new soul
“It&#39;s hard to believe, but this building, despite its many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Trowborst.
The heat of the earth is used to heat and cool it.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass cover, even on clear days the sun gets inside only for a short time.
Wide laminated timber trusses perpendicular to the glass façade provide shade and absorb most of the sun&#39;s rays.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned IT skeptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verheig was already here.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, who called Buckenberg &quot;the soul of Speikenisse, which has been lacking for a long time.&quot;
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from their own collection.
These books were supposed to take up empty spaces on the shelves of the not yet fully stocked library - at that time there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
The shelves are packed to the top.
&quot;There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says architect Winy Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident is now connected in some way with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it is only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal problem, which in professional jargon is called identity creation.
Speikenisse wrote his literary history.
And even if they are very young and uneducated.
After all, this is only the starting point for building an identity.
Szabo: &quot;Germans must play a more important role&quot;
Germany abstained in the vote to recognize Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany first signaled that it would vote against the Palestinians&#39; application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that she also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 uprising in Libya, Germany also abstained from voting on the no-fly zone.
As a result, NATO passed the proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, it is moving from a policy that, so to speak, ruled by the United States, to German foreign policy itself.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans do not have an agreed common policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that while they are only groping for their role, they are on the way to a &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy as France or Great Britain is pursuing.
What exactly does &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a position in their national interests that does not depend on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and connections with certain regions such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany&#39;s economic interests are largely different from those of other large states, and therefore Germany must defend its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the voting in the UN?
First, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf states.
Therefore, she needs to be careful not to offend the public and elites in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I would not attach too much importance to this, this is not a completely one-way communication.
But in any case, this plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany hurt its relationship with the United States by refraining from making important decisions such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that understanding of the German position prevails in Europe and even in the USA.
Therefore, I do not think that it was as dramatic a breakdown as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect in this way.
After all, this signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests must be reckoned with.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
By contrast, the United States has clearly expressed its support for the veto.
Is there a divergence of opinion between the United States and many European states?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration, deep down, has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But due to the local political situation, the government, of course, cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not nearly as big as they always seem to be.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu&#39;s policies.
Is it easy for Germany to reconcile its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and its position as an important partner in the EU on the other?
I think this is what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be somewhat easier for the Germans if there was a single, consistent European policy, but this is not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot act within the framework of a broader approach and are forced to act instead, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
This is exactly what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take a leading role in developing a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, if only because of the ties with Israel.
This topic has always been sensitive.
But I think it&#39;s clear to the Germans that they need to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, won&#39;t it really take on a major role?
Or is Germany still having a hard time taking the lead?
Germany is not yet accustomed to this, it is still always unpleasant for it and, for obvious reasons, it is still always difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes on an important role, a variety of anti-German sentiments emerge.
It is not easy for the Germans to deal with this.
Actually, this is an old problem: you don&#39;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
She has to take into account a wide variety of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, the US influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a larger role.
Even if you do not like it, it is unpleasant or intensifies the dislike for you - such is life!

&quot;Trademark Protection&quot; in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Go Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from whose names it is derived.
However, it will remain protected until the owners of the original names are sued.
But even then it is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
&quot;It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; said Thomas Pattloch, a trademark infringement lawyer for Taylor Wessing in the Far East.
A new case of this kind appears on my desk every week.
Imitators only need to add a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci it turns out Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies are legally copied, for example, the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder containing the records of the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark there, an artificial name that also uses the name of the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
It is well known that the Chinese are the world champions of copying and intellectual property infringement.
In big cities, there are multi-storey department stores selling almost exclusively knockoffs.
But Pattloch&#39;s case is different. On behalf of his trustees, he opposes that Chinese enterprises officially receive from the trademark registration office the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it &quot;bang mingpai,&quot; the passenger brand.
This word is associated with &quot;bang dakuan&quot;.
This is the name given to women who hunt rich men.
Chinese authorities plead not guilty
&quot;This is damaging to the business and must be dealt with,&quot; Pattloch is convinced.
&quot;The brand is being eroded, the unique position is being lost, the image suffers greatly.&quot;
The financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries run into the millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to market research company CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing luxury market with annual sales of 15 billion euros.
However, it is difficult and expensive to remove questionable trademark entries.
The process can last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed claims, since after a long time the protested name became &quot;a reality of the market.&quot;
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases about graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost its litigation with construction machine manufacturer Sany, a company that had recently acquired the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese are still allowed to use the emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought Volvo, initially used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost out in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The CTMO Trademark Registration Office in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to lack of staff and equipment.
But last year there was a &quot;return from the emergency in the work process to the norm.&quot;
Thus, the number of pending objection cases decreased by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, up 75 percent from last year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 claims are still awaiting production in the department.
Fighting this is costly
As is so often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China topped the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the agency said.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
To put it simply, this means that each registration costs an average of RMB 1,280 or 160 euros.
It costs many times more to challenge it, as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to ensure that their illegal production of counterfeit car parts was eliminated.
However, the imitator secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was an oversight of its own, as surnames in Germany cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
And the trademark registration office CTMO rejected the Munich claim.
True, Freudenberg won in both subsequent instances, but the opposing side continues to fight to this day.
Need to be on the lookout
The issue is currently pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: &quot;The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of our time, money and nerves.&quot;
Internal costs are hardly amenable to accounting, the firm&#39;s archives had to look even a hundred years ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing side &quot;a large six-figure sum in euros&quot; for a settlement.
&quot;This makes it clear how much it costs us,&quot; says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spill over even to Europe.
Namely, if the imitators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the Freudenberg name for footwear and leather goods.
The concern stopped production in these areas long ago, but despite this it was able to prevent registration.
&quot;You have to be on the lookout,&quot; says Wentzler.
Both he and attorney Pattloch recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks; rather, foreigners should “register everything that is worth protecting in any way in China as well,” says Wentzler.
Otherwise it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposing party license fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we will be pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Trample, Sing, Help
The Imbongi Choir rehearses in Heidelberg - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of relationships that covered a distance of more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there is a tapping sound: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies&#39; pumps and men&#39;s sneakers pick the beat on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One two three four.
Only then do the singers&#39; voices slowly rise - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they advance, enchant and follow each other.
And Fité Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his cloth shoes as he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday night, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song.
The rehearsal was attended by fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years old, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor.
&quot;Om&quot; Aubani &quot;is not an easy thing, each voice of the choir has its own text, moreover, in a completely foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS program, estimates that there are approximately 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland is home to 245,000 AIDS orphans.
Moreover, more than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
Voices for Africa found chiefs in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in Esitgeni village.
70 of them attend school preparing for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take over the sponsorship.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu means storyteller or praiser.
In this hall, they do not speak Bantu fluently, but they can sing.
For almost ten years the choir has been learning songs in this foreign soft language and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared: to the south of Africa.
Indeed, at a distance of 8733 kilometers of summer from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitgeni, which depends on the voices of a German choir.
Forty percent infected
About 2,000 people live there, some are still in simple huts made of clay and straw, and there are many children among the inhabitants.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the ICH virus.
Esitgeni mirrors the disease of all Swaziland in miniature: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost unacceptable in the general population.
More than forty percent of the Swaziland population carries the immunodeficiency virus, and death in the middle of their 40s is not uncommon.
The choir opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before that, the Imbogni members saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school education, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment of individual participants - for a few euros a year, send the child to school and give him the opportunity to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, which has since almost professionally taken care of AIDS orphans in Esitgeni.
Sexually Transmitted Infection Facts
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, and hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What are the main target groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydial infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea, and human papilloma virus.
HIV prevalence among heterosexual adults is relatively low in our country - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Chlamydial infections are much more common among young people than among other population groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years old.
Human papilloma virus is also common among our youth.
How is the number of infections changing?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011, according to the Robert Koch Institute.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints during urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as blisters or lumps.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain or other symptoms and go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not provide 100% protection.
Indeed, in part, the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread by contact infection and through close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular check-ups, especially if you frequently change sexual partners.
With early diagnosis, most STIs can be cured and long-term consequences avoided.
The sponsorship, donations and last but not least the royalties for the choir&#39;s performances all over Germany make it possible to collect something.
“In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitgeni,” says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is managed by Tsodva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well arranged, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as the old women are called in Zulu, is the mainstay of the village.
Some of them took in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that children in uniform appear in class every day on time.
Those with no family left go to an orphanage with Haniysila, a single woman who receives a salary from the association, as do two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and worked with the American health organization PSI to provide HIV testing for many of the villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but they prefer to remain deeply silent about the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country.
King with 14 wives
&quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it is associated with sexuality.&quot;
Quite unusual in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, this government-sanctioned lifestyle also bears the blame for the spread of the HCV virus so rapidly in recent years.
But it also lies with the wandering workers who are spreading the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, “but they are hardly ever used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh. &quot;
To bolster the cultural exchange a little, the Ibmogni Choir makes a tour of southern Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in black - such a confession not only brings good mood and joy, but even, it happened, caused tears in the eyes of the harsh border guards.
The trip always leads also to Esitgeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Despite the fact that the small village can hardly be found on the map, it is more than famous in the valley of the Ötsulveni River.
“Go to Esitgeni, there is light,” say the people here.
And after the 8,733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when the stomping singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, the light can be seen here as well.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover can be up to 20 meters thick.
US Space Agency NASA has proven the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, it also contains frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that the permanently shadowed region of the planet is covered in ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid colliding with Mercury.
No one connects the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the probe&#39;s scientific director Sean Solomon.
Temperatures on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life got elsewhere in the solar system.
Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots, such as &quot;Phoenix&quot;, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows in endless distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a &quot;planet&quot; according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union&#39;s new definition.
This infrared fragment from the Spitzer telescope presents a &quot;family portrait&quot; of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in the form of blue dots, pink &quot;newborn&quot; stars are more difficult to identify in the star circle.
This star-forming region - unromanticly called W5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6500 light-years away.
This iridescent glow of a dying star was photographed by NASA&#39;s Spitzer Telescope.
The donut-like ring is made of material that the star threw out in the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are emerging from gas and dust.
NASA&#39;s Spitzer Telescope snapped this photograph of a galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen with the naked eye at night.
Of course, with a telescope, colors come out better.
Like a red eye, the Helix Nebula winks at the observer in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years away in the constellation Aquarius.
The resemblance to the terrestrial continent has earned this nebula the nickname &quot;North America&quot;.
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides vivid color reproduction.
This new star in all its beauty was photographed only with the infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and Its Rings: How They Came to Be is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps these are fragments of the moon of Saturn, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and clearest images from the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color rendering, images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Triphid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (tripartite, tripartite), as dark streaks of dust divide into three parts the red-hot heart of the cradle of stars.
In the constellation Ophiuchus, astronomers photographed the precursor of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies rush towards each other and will inevitably collide.
The Hubble telescope captured the birth of a star in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn&#39;t like technical abbreviations can call her by the nickname &quot;South Landing Wheel&quot;.
A photograph from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is composed of dust particles that are ten to one hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images from various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the large spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This stellar nebula is home to the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle is constantly creating new stars.
This star cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars - 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly luminous galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it originated shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our Views of the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey - even before Galileo Galilei began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more - and the spaces available to their eyes are deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror pictured here was five meters in diameter.
A &quot;Large Binocular Telescope&quot; has been installed in Arizona, USA.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
&quot;Gran Telescopio Canarias&quot; has a giant internal structure - the diameter of the mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to keep costs down.
Nevertheless, it reaches about eleven meters in diameter.
The disadvantage of an inexpensive design: the telescope is rigidly fastened at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature: high light-collecting ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world&#39;s largest telescopes.
With the radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen for extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by lending their computing power.
View of the European Astronomical Service Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There is a &quot;Very Large Telescope&quot; - fully consistent with its name.
Its four mirrors allow it to illuminate even the mid-infrared spectrum in the telescope.
The Chilean ESO observatory is also planning to install the European &quot;Very Large Telescope&quot;.
Its main mirror should stretch as much as 42 meters - and will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which, along with them, also looks into the sky with the help of Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope should appear on Mauna Kea - with a mirror thirty meters in diameter.
Here you can admire it in the illustration.
However, the most important views from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been delivering paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for planets outside the solar system - primarily those on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets have been discovered since the start of the mission.
The photograph shows the latest preparations for the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space no earlier than 2018 aboard the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it must search for the Big Bang by the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists speculate that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, since the &quot;Messenger&quot; rotates closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements over the decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to orbit Mercury - scientists are now confident of this.
Drink oil every day - and live to be 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically venerable age.
There is even a longevity museum here.
Searching for a clue in a country where 97-year-old elders seem still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically venerable age.
There is even a longevity museum here.
Searching for a clue in a country where 97-year-old elders seem still relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The minibus rumbles along a winding road past thickly wooded hills, turbulent rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything around is so green and bright that you might think that you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the southernmost edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
Talysh live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they speak Farsi and Azerbaijani perfectly and are distinguished by longevity.
The destination is Lerik.
The small town boasts of the too heavy architecture of the Soviet era, which does not at all harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly ever come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
It takes eight hours to reach 323 kilometers, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth, which the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea, has not yet reached the province.
However, Pilata Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerik.
&quot;In May, Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will host the festival of the oldest people in the world,&quot; Fatulaeva said.
She is the director of the longevity museum, probably the only one in the world.
The biographies of about eight dozen Talysh from these places, which are over 100 years old, are documented here. Fatulaeva points to a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he is here for 120 years.
He had another child at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Shirali Myuslyumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate, however.
And given that the oldest person, whose age is confirmed by documents, is 122 years old, Myuslyumov&#39;s age seems extremely doubtful.
&quot;He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973,&quot; explains Fatulaeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
So did the shepherd Myuslyumov add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of centenarians in Central Asia.
&quot;A striking number of elderly people can also be found in parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;and there are a lot of very old people living in Sardinia as well.&quot;
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age is impossible, since there were no civil registers.
A glass of ghee every day
However, it is a fact that people in the Lerik area are strikingly biblical in age.
Now 20 people over 100 years old live here.
Why are there so many centenarians here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzade explains this by the special genes of the Talysh.
The director of the museum, Fatulaeva, on the other hand, believes that it is about nutrition.
Talysh love meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink a glass of ghee every day. However, such a high-calorie diet is unlikely to be nutritionally healthy.
Or is it a primitive way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzoeva lives in Chenghemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of the sons and daughter of Mirzaeva, who have long had their grandchildren.
Also, two kids are jumping nearby.
Tea is prepared in the kitchen and served in typical pot-bellied Armudu glasses.
Mirzaeva has perfectly straight and strong white teeth; under her headscarf she hides long dark blond braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always wash my hair with milk, so it never falls out and retains its color.
&quot;And I have never used shampoo,&quot; says Mirzaeva.
A monthly pension is enough for a living
She always ate only what grew in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought groceries in a store.
She then talks about her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest part was after the Second World War.
But it got better when the &quot;beloved father&quot; Heydar Aliyev took the helm.
Propaganda is not often heard in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, practically knows no borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the reins.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani old people.
Mirzaeva receives 230 manats (approximately equal to the same amount of euros) monthly as a pension, for local conditions this is the amount on which one can live well.
And, perhaps, the long-grown son of Mirzaeva is also right: &quot;The old people in our culture are deeply respected.&quot;
They live in a large family, are loved, cared for and happy.
What is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word &quot;human right&quot; is missing from the constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo bear witness to the deep division of the country.
The future sharia-based constitution met with fierce opposition.
The Egyptian president was generous with pathos.
We must create a transition.
&quot;And his success lies with my responsibility to the people and to God,&quot; he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, until now hopelessly divided in the confused opposition, are in fear.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said that he temporarily curtailed the competence of the constitutional court and expanded its competence &quot;to save the revolution.&quot;
However, what the 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate from the American University of Southern California actually wants to save is not entirely clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be nullified?
In fact, 234 articles managed to get through in a 15-hour obstacle race overnight at an Islamist-minded 100-member constitutional assembly, and this is partly a matter of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the legal procedure is based on &quot;the principles of Islamic law.&quot;
But what do &quot;principles&quot; mean?
This was and remains a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal backlash to reinterpret the Sharia law.
At least this is hinted at in one newly introduced article: in all matters concerning Sharia law, Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country, with great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be involved for the council.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which, de facto, would have the effect of limiting the judiciary.
Much is the subject of interpretation in the draft constitution
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians to a military court must remain.
These courts during the Mubarak period served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
Also, as stated in the draft, the state must protect the &quot;true essence of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;uphold its morality and values.&quot;
Legally, this is formulated so vaguely that state institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of films and literature.
In plain text, this means nothing more than censorship.
In general, not a single article directly establishes equality between men and women.
But the other forbids insulting and denigrating the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording that “offending people” is prohibited is also doubtful.
Will a cartoon of the president or a joke about a jurist be enough?
A question of interpretation, like much in this draft, which Morsi is proposing for signature and which, in his words, &quot;very soon&quot; will be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum.
&quot;The revolution is back&quot;
For several weeks now, opposition has been forming against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in extraordinary unanimity on Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it can take effect.
&quot;The revolution is back and we will win,&quot; said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came in third in the presidential election.
Mohammed ElBaradei, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the international atomic energy agency, said that the draft constitution belongs to &quot;the dustbin of history.&quot;
Through Twitter, he accused Morsi supporters of wanting to spearhead a &quot;coup against democracy.&quot;
&quot;If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,&quot; said opposition leader Yasser Said.
&quot;We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged,&quot; the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also indicated that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would invalidate it.
&quot;The Koran is our constitution&quot;
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of veiled women and adherents of the Salafis, who shouted: &quot;The people demand the application of God&#39;s law.&quot;
They demanded from Mursi: &quot;Cleanse the country!&quot; and assured: &quot;The Koran is our constitution.&quot;
The struggle for power over the symbolic square, where it all began, provoked a state of almost civil war.
The followers of Morsi, quite obviously, did not want to take this risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should take.
Most are for the Islamists&#39; project, it is considered a settled matter.
&quot;The concept of&quot; human rights &quot;is never mentioned&quot;
Hafiz Abu Sayed is furious at this forced constitutional process, which, in fact, was supposed to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHRO) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were imprisoned or put on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words &quot;human rights&quot; are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;.
The expansion of Mursi&#39;s influence on all three branches of government in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures represent clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
&quot;Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president de facto annulled it,&quot; Saeda regrets.
After all, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Sayeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
For this, retribution may come.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: &quot;You are creating a monster that you cannot control.&quot;
Norwegian rakfisk: the most smelly fish in the world?
Norway&#39;s 5 million people have one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Perhaps the secret of this country&#39;s success has something to do with a local addiction to one extremely offensive fish dish?
Take some overripe cheese chunks.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
The smell of rakfisk, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies, will be created for you.
I am in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
Scenic views covered with snow all around. It is very beautiful, but there is an indestructible characteristic smell in the air.
Rakfisk is a trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for up to a year, depending on what kind of sweetness you want to achieve.
As dusk deepens and colder, crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this very, shall we say, exciting dish.
“It is eaten raw and washed down with a glass of aquavit, the local caraway vodka,” explains Haward Halvarsen, a local firefighter and Rakfisk general who runs the festival.
All around us, people eat fish cut into small cubes and wash it down with large drinks.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” says Howard.
This drink is able to kill the smell.
I&#39;m trying a couple of bites.
If you manage to carry a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad - not much different from the portion of sushi that you took with you on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a completely different era, a time of poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish was soaked in hermetically sealed barrels of salt water in the fall.
Then, in deep winter, when the fish was already well and thoroughly fermented, it was taken out and, muffling its perception with alcohol, was eaten.
The last generation remembers the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate, mainly to the USA.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants who are attracted here by jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (a longtime rival, and not so long ago and a much more prosperous neighbor) come here to work en masse.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, albeit somewhat fetid element of Norway&#39;s past.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will set you back £ 9 ($ 14).
Norway rarely makes headlines in the world, and most people in the country seem to be fine with it.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, the racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the terrorist attack is called &quot;what happened on July 22nd.&quot;
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
At the heart of Norway&#39;s prosperity today is the growth (since the early seventies) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our waitress serving trays of seasoned rakfisk, a woman with long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, the epitome of Nordic well-being.
We are such a people - as you call it - reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks excellent English.
We do not like to be shown, we are not boastful.
Norway is very careful with its oil - most of the revenues of the oil and gas industry are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone wasted money they didn’t have, Norway was careful to calculate all costs.
&quot;As long as you can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, that&#39;s enough for happiness,&quot; says Anna.
“And there is rakfisk,” she adds with a carefree laugh.
I&#39;m standing in the snow in line for some food - I&#39;ve had enough of Rakfisk.
Here is a hamburger with moose meat - this is certainly exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell awaits us.
I have a special rakfisk dinner at my hotel, where visitors vote on the best or perhaps the most flavorful fish.
There is a live TV broadcast, in which they show the host in a bow tie, surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
It&#39;s like the Eurovision Song Contest.
&quot;So, Thor-Jurgen, what grade did you give for the best fish out there in your mountains?&quot;
&quot;Yes, Howard, here&#39;s our score.&quot;
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls out of the chair, possibly after going over the aquavit.
Or maybe just breathing in the smell of this fish.
Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto will have a difficult career start.
As new Mexican President-elect Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC reporter Will Grant invites us to look at the challenges he will face and the mixed expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently in a particularly dire state.
This city is congested with transport and at the best of times, and since Monday, steel barriers have been erected, cutting off several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will don the presidential sling and take the reins of the country.
He faces a daunting task.
Mexico has enjoyed good economic performance under the now resigning administration of Felipe Calderón, but the country is mired in a war on drugs that has claimed nearly 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government is declaring to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence,” Mr. Peña Nieto told US President Barack Obama earlier this week in the White House Oval Office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, alongside the President of the United States, Mr. Peña Nieto&#39;s political career developed as governor of his home state of Mexico City.
In his homeland, in a densely populated and sprawling state that surrounds the country&#39;s capital, opinions were divided about the new leader.
Straightforward person
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is fondly remembered.
Residents credit him with the revitalization of tourism, the development of the resort sector and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached via one of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which are strikingly different from the potholed and pit roads that were previously on this site.
Placards with his name hang on the modern sports center building and on the impressive interactive climate change museum.
&quot;We are pinning our hopes on him for real and meaningful change,&quot; says his friend and political ally Gabrielle Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman from the Pena Nieto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed by our country, primarily in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he denies the accusations of lack of content, which the opposition has put forward to the new president.
He is very straightforward and very dedicated to realizing his vision of the country&#39;s future.
This is an excellent statesman, and, above all, a person who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nes, is in stark contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden underneath highways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe in this metropolis.
Earlier this year, troops were brought in to tame drug gangs in these areas; and violence against women is particularly acute here.
In a vacant lot near a vast dump, several dozen bodies of murdered women have been found in the last two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico City during the governorship of Mr. Peña Nieto, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, which has become a household name when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr. Peña Nieto, at best it can be said about him that during his tenure as governor, he was unable to cope with the problem of the murder of women.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of a concrete house similar to most of the houses in this dilapidated area, Irenéa Buendia can hardly hold back her tears as she shows me photographs of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner killed her.
“When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed before,” Ms Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she had been beaten and her body was already numb.
Mariana&#39;s mother retells this story, and her daughter&#39;s portrait looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to the crucifix, on which is inscribed just one word: justice.
It was this, they said, that this family was denied.
&quot;State officials treated me like an old gossip, a disgruntled troublemaker.
They want people to just take what they say on faith and keep quiet.
But it’s wrong, it’s impossible, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around, ”she says.
Donning the presidential sling on Saturday, President Peña Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crimes, and the new president has pledged to prioritize addressing the issue during his tenure.
“I hope he will be exactly the same president as he was governor,” says Olvera, a PRI congressman from Valle de Bravo.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nes fear most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of mistreatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning&#39;s claims of poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, increased attention was paid to Manning&#39;s stay at the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense is demanding that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning&#39;s conditions of detention were harsh.
A private in the US Army is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest classified leaks in U.S. history, did not take advantage of multiple opportunities to file a complaint about the ill-treatment he said he endured while in a military prison.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, Attorney General Ashden Fein stated that records of Manning&#39;s weekly visits by prison officials during his nine months in Quantico, Virginia, contained no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of the defense motion to discontinue Manning&#39;s case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were harsh and in themselves punishment enough was carried out the day after Manning stated that while in custody he intended to commit suicide ...
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet by the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During Friday&#39;s hearing, Attorney Fein, along with Manning, reviewed the reports that were filled out following visits to Manning by officials during his time in Quantico Prison, where he was held under strict conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Prosecutor Fein asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he rated himself as &quot;excellent&quot; by the prison administration and the general conditions of detention as &quot;very professionally organized.&quot;
The reports reviewed did not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite Manning being directly asked about his conditions of detention, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed verbal concern about the problems and that the administration officials who visited him discussed the problems with him and said that they would be dealt with, but did not write it down.
&quot;They wrote down &#39;no issues&#39; (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t bring it up in the conversation,&quot; says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lindh, also asked Manning why he didn’t complain about his ill-treatment in January 2011 during a committee meeting considering suicidal intentions, which he had expressed in writing several months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted to get him removed from the &quot;injury prevention&quot; regime and relaxed conditions of detention.
The military officials explained that the restricted detention regime - one level lower than the supervision regime to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner as well as for the safety of others.
“I wanted to let the administration know that I’m okay, so that they can remove the injury prevention regime ... so that my level of life improves, from my point of view,” explained Manning.
Manning testified Thursday of his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a prison at the Naval Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait and that one day he passed out due to extreme heat.
He explained that psychologically it is very difficult when you are not allowed to know how your fate is being decided and what is happening in the outside world.
&quot;My world has shrunk to the Camp Arifjan base, to the size of my prison,&quot; Manning said Thursday.
&quot;I thought I was going to die in this cage.&quot;
While in Quantico, Manning, he says, spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - all alone.
Manning says he was only allowed to keep a mattress, blanket, slippers, a few pieces of clothing, and glasses.
He says that he tried to move, since sleeping or even just lying in the daytime was forbidden by the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, light from outside the cell was constantly hitting his eyes.
If the guards did not see his face when he rolled over in bed at night, then, according to him, he was woken up and forced to turn over on his back.
Manning&#39;s lawyer filed a formal objection to Manning&#39;s ill-treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about a statement he made during his Thursday testimony that after being forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates. at the morning check.
Manning stated that he was not able to cover himself with a blanket during the check.
Answering the judge&#39;s questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard&#39;s order that he should throw a blanket to cover himself, but admitted that no one had explicitly ordered him to throw it.
Manning said Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night due to his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said that he told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his panties or slippers to injure himself, but did not.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, slippers and glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he went through during his detention and significantly reduce the sentence if Manning is found guilty by a military court, which is to begin hearing his case early next year.
The defense said it plans to invite Manning to plead guilty for less serious crimes, and dispute other charges as excessive.
The resumption of the hearings is scheduled for this weekend, with the prosecution expected to insist that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico under the highest security rules.
Charges leveled at Manning include aiding the enemy, illegally facilitating the release of data on the Internet, transmitting national defense information, and stealing government property or documents.
If convicted on all counts of the indictment, he could face life imprisonment.
My Crisis of National Identity is the story of a Mexican American.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of the country about difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that American Mexicans are torn between the two cultures.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the arrivals corridor, approached the border control area, and froze in place.
The signs indicated two lines: one for the Mexicanos (Mexicans), the other for the Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for several seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California and have been called Mexican all my life.
It&#39;s just a shorthand name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York call themselves Italians.
Later, I settled on the intricate construction of &quot;Mexican American&quot;.
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather&#39;s homeland, there was no need for conventional names or complex structures.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than native speakers, and I can&#39;t get rid of my American accent.
So I took out my American passport and stood in line for the Extranjeros.
I recalled this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda included issues familiar to the meetings of the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto has been eager to talk about a boom in the Mexican economy that will allow Mexicans to now just as well stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a kind of North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and resentful question.
It never occurred to most Americans that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced its leaders at gunpoint to give up half of their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only necessary for any US statesman to say a word of criticism towards Mexico, the press and among the elite of Mexican society immediately hear complaints that the Americans are encroaching on the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with militancy.
The most difficult is Mexico&#39;s relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about grudges?
There are enough of them.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in this country and those for whom there are no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio there are so many people of Mexican descent for one reason only: at some point in their family history, anyone - a father or a grandfather - did not have the opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often these were Mexicans of a certain type - swarthy, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember this.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Today our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we went to good schools and got good jobs, but we must not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider ours.
United States of America.
Plus, we know that most of the Mexican elite and ruling class don&#39;t like us.
We answer them in kind.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us like second-class people, like fake Mexicans.
We do not speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We would not find ourselves behind the silk curtain now, finding a well-fed life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and it reminds me that there are certain tensions between real Mexicans and Mexican Americans - Mexicans have a better understanding of their national identity, while Mexican Americans are offended.
She is a US citizen and believes she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of the Mexican Americans I know don&#39;t feel like they belong to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
When you get the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
And in the USA we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship is not already tangled enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to act as ambassadors for Mexico and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends how wonderful this country is and how great it is to visit, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah of course.
Nothing will come of it.
Too many grievances in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country so beautiful at all.
Sorry, but deal with this yourself, amigos.
And this is true.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what it did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still resentful about how their relatives were treated in Mexico recently. ...
Yeah.
Perhaps we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
Ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas may provide fragile foundation for further peace
Is Lasting Peace Possible Between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed pushes one to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
The habitual, senseless arguments about who started first are heard; many buildings have been turned into ruins; over 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis killed; for the first time during the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip fell in the vicinity of the Israeli capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly bogged down in their age-old conflict, change has come to the Middle East.
This can be viewed in different ways, but the events of the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; swirled a lot of established realities in a rebellious storm, and the Palestinians and the Israelis did not manage to stay away from the whirlwind that shook the region.
Perhaps as a result, their fight will become even bloodier than before.
However, there are reasons that give hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
War without winners
At first glance, the current situation does not give grounds for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on November 21, is carried out, this week&#39;s clashes have only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will argue that they forced Israel to retreat despite the losses they suffered.
Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the group were killed, and 1.7 million people were trapped in one of the most densely populated and problem areas of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion that time is on their side.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new powerful and wealthy friends.
A resurgent regional leader Turkey, once Israel&#39;s closest Muslim ally, has come out in support of Hamas; Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the Persian Gulf, followed its example.
Triumphant Hamas supporters claim the creation of an Islamist crescent around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, ruled by the paramilitary Hezbollah, to Syria, in which increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow the rule of Bashar Assad, and on to Jordan, where the king&#39;s power is threatened by allies Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on Israel&#39;s southern borders, the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood was strengthened under President Mohammad Morsi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was ousted in 2011, was a secular dictator with little emphasis on supporting Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, is an organization much like Hamas, and their leaders are more populist.
In future diplomatic constellations, Hamas may become a significant player, whose voice even Israel and America will not be able to drown out.
At the same time, hardliners in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
Militarily, Hamas was defeated.
Israel&#39;s Iron Dome anti-missile system has justified the cost of its development and has successfully destroyed many of the missiles launched by Hamas.
Israeli citizens can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, the United States has remained true to its unchanged position; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004 about 30 Israelis have died from rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part by the wall that extends into the West Bank, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian states - and protects Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu&#39;s position, whose Likud party - in preparation for the January 22 elections - has teamed up with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, is quite convenient.
What is the point of pandering to the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If you put all power in the West Bank into their hands, will they not start firing rockets from there towards Israel, as their brothers in the Gaza Strip do?
Better to keep them behind a wall and firmly suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will prevail; however, their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring.
While the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, internal problems will become their priority.
Israel&#39;s defense budget is larger than all of its Arab neighbors combined.
Unleashing a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments bolster their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egyptian President Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on the ceasefire, is a good sign and could herald the beginning of change.
Israel, no less, must consider the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic change takes place in Arab countries, stripping Palestinians of their right to self-determination is a ticking time bomb that will sooner or later explode in Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of a democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations that are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement come at a price with growing international discontent.
Both sides need external impetus
There remains the only solution that sane representatives on both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper, are relentlessly calling for: the formation of two states and the cession of territories by Israel in exchange for security.
There remains hope, not very impressive in the short term - the hope that a ceasefire will allow other countries to more effectively influence the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which is long overdue to decide to cut off arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, and Turkey and Qatar are more than ever positioned to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming vote in the UN, which could result in the recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama must also play a role in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he continues to demonstrate a reluctance to get involved in solving this problem.
This is a disastrously short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is only possible in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia has enacted a uniform packaging law for cigarettes.
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and images of diseased body parts stand out in contrast on dull green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The world&#39;s first Australian law on the same type of packaging for cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and color design of different brands with the same dull olive box with creepy pictures of diseased body parts and images of children whose health was undermined by their parents&#39; smoking.
Apart from various pictures and inscriptions warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packs, introduced without fail this Saturday, is the names of stamps, which are printed in the same small print.
These are the most severe conditions in the world for the packaging of tobacco products.
The Australian federal government says the goal of this measure is to keep young people from smoking by stripping the habit of fashionable status.
This decision was based on the results of studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26, in 99 cases out of 100, never become smokers.
“It is obvious that even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through packaging design,” explains Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that have shown that, for example, a crown in a logo is associated in children with the idea of a princess. ...
Australia is one of the countries with the smallest smokers in the world, so these changes will not greatly affect the profits of multinationals, but other countries are already considering taking similar measures.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the passage of this law.
The tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the black market share of cheap and affordable cigarettes.
&quot;This law will have serious consequences different from those envisioned by its initiators,&quot; said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Representative in Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will supply many more of these items to sell on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the other hand, new laws are driving business growth.
Sandra Ha of a small family-owned company, Zico Import Pty Ltd, argues that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone cases that hide unpleasant pictures on the packaging has skyrocketed (practically from scratch) since two months ago such companies as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their case in the Australian high court, where they tried to appeal against the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about 6,000 products to wholesalers and is expecting a new batch.
This is good business for us.
A potential hindrance to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the very segment of the population to which these measures are directed.
Following the passage of a series of laws in Australia that made it illegal to advertise cigarettes on television and support sporting events, and prohibit sellers from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local businesses and websites from advertising online, but it cannot restrict overseas sites from doing so.
&quot;If you are a tobacco dealer and you have only this small loophole left, the idea of promoting your product on the Internet will be very tempting for you,&quot; explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of brand reviews written in the name of supposedly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is this really the handiwork of an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he spared no effort and time and made a video, or is there an advertising company behind it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry is now more busy adapting to new regulations than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry have even gone to measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states are making claims within the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade was unfairly restricted, despite the fact that trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very small.
A WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the government has discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory posting of photographs warning about the dangers of smoking.
Now this rule has been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of stricter laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia defiantly disobey innovation.
These pictures don&#39;t bother me.
I just don&#39;t pay attention.
“You just grab a cigarette and put the pack in your pocket,” explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a photo of an oral tumor on the pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yoo, manager of King of the Pack tobacconists in downtown Sydney, says the same packaging made it harder to place items on the shelves.
&quot;It used to take me an hour to unload a new batch, but now it&#39;s four hours,&quot; he complains.
&quot;The government should have taken and completely banned cigarettes, then we would have said: what to do, okay, it&#39;s all over, we are closing the store,&quot; he says, throwing up his hands.
Getting bored in the world of electronic grids and constant connections is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving Day, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had a mechanical problem and was replaced by another plane that we were waiting for.
This gave me plenty of time to reflect on the nature of boredom.
I will not deceive you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for your flight is really boring, and books, magazines, iPhones, or even duty-free shops will not help much.
Recently, however, an increasing number of scientists and child development specialists have spoken out in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations, it is not so bad for us and for our children to be bored.
This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting, related topics, which may be conducive to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some kind of screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we need to strive for boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time, no.
We will come back to this later.
Previously, I, like many, believed that boredom was an invention of relatively recent times, when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of The Fascinating History of Boredom (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
“In fact, boredom has a very ancient history,” he says.
On the walls in Pompeii, Latin inscriptions about boredom dating from the first century are found.
This leaves open the question of how we understand boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has changed frequently.
After reviewing the research material on this topic and asking a question of a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people &quot;want but cannot do something that would bring them satisfaction.&quot;
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person isn&#39;t doing something they would like to do.
With apathy, you don&#39;t want to do anything.
The main thing in the boredom experienced, he says, is &quot;a disturbance in attention and the associated deterioration in mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly.&quot;
Boredom can seem a lot like depression when described.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these states, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel like we are bored when in reality it is simply difficult for us to concentrate on something.
In their study, The Idle Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention, published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a recording of a voice reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard the loud sounds of an irrelevant TV program playing in the next room, others heard the same sounds at a low volume so that they could hardly be heard, and the third group listened only to the voice recording without extraneous soundtrack.
Those participants who heard the TV at low volume noted that they were bored, more often than others - it was difficult for them to concentrate, but they did not know the reason for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we&#39;re trying to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interruptions can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, &quot;for example, peering into the flow of products on an assembly line in search of defects, distracting music can help to avoid boredom.&quot;
It is believed, he continues, that when people start to sway in a chair or draw scribbles on a piece of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that in fact, such actions simply help not to relax physically.
&quot;The study showed that children who are not prohibited from fidgeting and spinning, learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit still,&quot; says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we all experience boredom: when the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting movie.
However, different people show different degrees of boredom tendencies.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a &quot;Boredom Propensity Scale&quot; to measure these individual characteristics.
This scale uses questions and statements such as &quot;Much of what I have to do is monotonous and monotonous&quot; or &quot;I am interested in too many things, so there is not enough time for anything.&quot;
Using these questionnaires, researchers have determined that boys are more likely to be bored than girls, ”says Stephen Wodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida,“ especially in the presence of a variety of external stimuli.
In general, however, teenagers are often bored in general.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he paged almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He got the following results: 32% of teens said they were bored at school and while doing homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
At the same time, only 3% of parents noted that they are bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what similar data on boredom would be now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that &quot;adolescence is the peak of the tendency to boredom,&quot; mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Back to my original question: is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, studies show that it can push people into absurd and dangerous physical activities, risky gambling or the abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have pondered the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
&quot;This is how our brains tell us to do something else; that&#39;s boredom,&quot; says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this very brain does not always know what exactly is better to do.
If you get bored and channel that energy into guitar playing or culinary experiences, you will make yourself better.
However, if you watch TV, you will only get better for a while, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will stop bored, but he will not learn to deal with boredom on his own or in any other way to manage his time and employment, says Professor Fenske.
“And these self-regulatory skills are used in a wide variety of situations,” he says.
Your child not only learns to keep himself occupied with something, he also learns to self-control in general.
I don&#39;t think boredom should be extolled in any way.
However, it is not worth considering it as something bad either.
Rather, one should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous stream of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“We see it in such a way that we need to feel bored more often, while boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
&quot;In today&#39;s world, we are used to constantly overstimulating our senses,&quot; he says, &quot;and when there is silence, we get lost and don&#39;t know what to do.&quot;
It is not yet clear how Colorado&#39;s new marijuana law will be enforced.
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old soccer player and community college student in southeastern Colorado, is charged with a felony of what will soon be perfectly legal throughout the state: possession of a small batch of marijuana and a pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orozco says he was in Lamar with friends one September, driving along the prairie near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and possession of a drug-using device - minor offenses, each with a $ 100 fine - and a court date.
“We are treated like criminals,” says Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been going on for weeks after the state of Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, hundreds of small court cases depend not so much on the law as on the location.
Petty marijuana charges are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which has taken a similar action.
Police stations have already stopped charging people 21 and older for possession of small doses, which will become legal as soon as the law goes into effect in a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative counties of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to try existing marijuana cases and are still being prosecuted for possession of the drug.
At the same time, cities from the Denver suburbs to the highlands of the West are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from entering their locations.
&quot;This is all progressing so fast that I don&#39;t even know what to expect next,&quot; says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulatory officials in Washington state are also scratching their heads in puzzlement.
They will have to formulate rules to determine the licensing procedure for the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most other states in dealing with marijuana use, first for medical purposes and now for entertainment.
&quot;Colorado has a more orderly market, so they are a good example,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcoholic Beverages Regulatory Board.
But now, no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, than put forward some suggestions and hope it works.
“We have no real precedent to guide us,” he says.
The Washington state bill, dubbed I-502, will go into effect on December 6 and will leave the state in a state of uncertainty for a full year, when there is no state licensing system yet and the right to own marijuana is already legalized.
And there are still tricky technical issues that need to be addressed during this period, such as balancing the state&#39;s &quot;adequate access&quot; directive to licensed marijuana with a ban on the sale of it 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens ...
“It will be especially difficult to locate licensed marijuana businesses within urban areas, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly formed Marijuana Legalization Center research group.
On November 21, Police Chief Oates of Aurora emailed his subordinates that the city&#39;s prosecutor&#39;s office would no longer prosecute individuals under the age of 21 for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police will no longer convict people of these violations &quot;starting from now on&quot;.
Police Chief Oates said police will enforce the city&#39;s medical marijuana regulations and prosecute illegal drug dealers and distributors.
The North Colorado Weld County Attorney, Ken Buck, takes a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After voting on the bill, he said prosecutors would continue to prosecute marijuana possession, mainly to induce people who use it to get treatment.
At the moment, 119 people have been charged with possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused of other violations.
“It is our institution&#39;s duty to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time they are committed,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was mixed, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer prosecute adults for possession of small amounts of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Houtzinger upheld the decision, but also decided not to drop charges in already pending marijuana possession cases.
“I believe it is our direct responsibility to enforce the law until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of Colorado residents who voted supported the decision, incorporating recreational marijuana issues into government and legal systems will not be easy.
And the controversial reactions of residents in different parts of the state exposed the ambiguity of the attitude of local authorities to the state&#39;s experiment with marijuana.
&quot;There is a cultural barrier for district attorneys on this issue,&quot; explains Sean McAlister, a Denver lawyer representing marijuana offenders and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
&quot;They&#39;ve persecuted people for this for so long that now they can&#39;t really come to terms with the fact that this is no longer a crime,&quot; he says.
Colorado and Washington - the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana in the same way as alcohol - are destined to become a nationwide experimental field to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Legalization advocates and state officials plan to expand the legalized trade, but at the same time they are anxiously awaiting guidance from the federal government, which still plans to view the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of legalizing marijuana are hoping the Justice Department will give in on this issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of traffickers and patients who used marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government has largely approved the medical marijuana trade in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Drug Enforcement Bureau agents are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small packet of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores that are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on affairs. the fight against drugs in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for federal action.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana stores that would not have been able to open earlier than a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, brought forward a six-month ban on the marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in a position where we license someone and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level,” says Bob Nicholson, a city councilor.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many unresolved issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was kicked out of Oxford for being a Conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As far back as I can remember, I have always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of the ancient symposium, laying the two foundations of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of history at Worcester College, Oxford University in the late 1980s, I packed my bags and left, which was the first real scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
The friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn&#39;t like my classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from chipped cups.
In fact, it was not that funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was systematically harassed and intimidated.
Not at all because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I went to a private school.
I was persecuted for only one reason, and in this illustrious cradle of enlightenment it looked like real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a famous adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the Conservatives.
You ask, why remember this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students with a center-right view is facing the same harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of Conservative students at Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection for their rights as that given to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at the student club at Corpus Christi College in Cambridge say they are &quot;often actively isolated, personally attacked and made to feel unwelcome&quot; because of their political views.
They want to add an additional representative to the college&#39;s equal rights committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was further exacerbated by the recently released BBC 2 documentary on student politics, Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right, in which conservatives were portrayed as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cook, the former president of the University of Oxford Conservatives&#39; Association, who drives a Rolls Royce, wears a silver suit and a silver-topped cane.
At other universities, conservative students complain that they are being made &quot;scapegoats for higher tuition fees.&quot;
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the University of Nottingham Conservative Association, said in a Sunday newspaper interview that “there is an increasing bias towards the left in the university environment.
People who don&#39;t even know us consider us in advance to be arrogant and violent children of rich parents with impunity. &quot;
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi College where the increased protection was requested, calls the atmosphere &quot;uncomfortable,&quot; and Stephanie Cherill, 19, the new president of the Conservative Association of Oxford University, says student club members&#39; attitudes towards bearers of center-right views has deteriorated significantly.
&quot;This poses a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply to the normal life of club members,&quot; she says.
The first few weeks at Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was alone.
I entered there in September 1986 as a timid and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford was feverish with hatred of the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university had voted out former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to budget cuts for higher education.
Even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable in such an atmosphere.
In the first days of the freshman week, when students get to know each other and with the teachers, I felt for the first time what lay ahead.
I did not know yet that the teachers not only turned a blind eye to the persecution of conservative students, but they themselves took part in it with pleasure.
Political issues - miners&#39; strike, privatization and government opposition to sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - permeated through the wood-paneled walls of the auditoriums.
In my first workshop, I needed to translate an eighteenth century French text into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
&quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said the late professor Harry Pitt, &quot;please translate the first paragraph.&quot;
The text was given to me with difficulty, I stumbled.
Harry Pitt was a very bitter man with a cake-like face.
&quot;Are the Thatcherites fundamentally not learning French or are they just lacking in brains?&quot; - he asked.
The other students giggled.
Tears came to my eyes.
&quot;I advise you to take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you are very busy moving around in society,&quot; Pitt muttered.
I returned to my room completely unhappy.
That evening in college, I sat alone at lunch; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a sophomore in English, who introduced himself as a member of the University&#39;s Association of Conservatives.
“I know who you are,” he said amiably.
- Unfortunately, this is the case:
anyone suspected of sympathizing with the Conservatives will be bullied.
It’s not easy for me myself, but in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, therefore it will be more difficult for you.
Most Conservative freshmen pretend to be Labor. &quot;
Later, at a local pub, I cowardly tried to be a hypocrite.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything that Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick failed.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You&#39;re contagious. &quot;
Other students took up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
“How do conservatives have sex?” Asked one of them.
&quot;They beat each other, don&#39;t they?&quot;
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the cancellation of the prosecution in the sixties.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or will I have to meet like-minded people only under cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become Labor and hide my true beliefs?
The three years ahead of me began to seem like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a Conservative, but also for being Thatcher&#39;s foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He barely showed up in college.
He despised him for his provinciality, pettiness and adherence to a Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won&#39;t be happy here,” he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parental home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased friends from the capital.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn&#39;t believe me.
During his studies in the forties, any political views were accepted there.
“But this is the best university in the world,” he said plaintively.
“They’re not capable of that, just not in the city of slumbering spiers ...
Even my communist friends have always behaved impeccably. &quot;
His wet eyes were dim.
&quot;Don&#39;t make hasty decisions.
I&#39;m sure this is just a joke.
You will break my heart if you leave university. &quot;
I was exhausted from the constant travel to London and my emotional defenses were weakening.
My friend, also a conservative, could not bear the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The next week, during a seminar, when another history teacher quite seriously called me an &quot;enemy of the people&quot;, I decided to do the same.
Burning with shame in my soul, I confessed that “my parents had brainwashed me” and called them “old fools”.
The respite was short-lived.
The final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was destined to be hammered by my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns every week for Rupert Murdoch&#39;s publications.
My door was locked.
I did not go out, and after five minutes my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a crybaby and a rag.
But at eighteen, no one should be the target of such anger and intimidation in school.
It is all the sadder that it was Oxford, which not only graduated fourteen Tory prime ministers, but to this day hides behind the undeserved reputation of a university that values equality and free thought.
&quot;Valentino prefers elegance to glory&quot;
ABC talks to Nati Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemica and other famous clients of the Italian designer about Valentino: Master of Sewing, which opened this week in London.
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of Valentino: Master of Sewing, a triumphant retrospective that brings together over 130 haute couture dresses his house has created over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is &quot;Il Signoret&quot; Garavani, but it could not have been written without his eminent clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of the nobility.
The first hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, is replete with personal letters and photographs signed by the most distinguished aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino displays these personal memories as trophies of his social upsurge: from the humble tailor from the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international &quot;elite&quot;.
There is nothing wrong with being in love with the royal court.
“At least they don’t extinguish their cigarette butts on your gorgeous carpet like some great pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemica.
In the 60s and 70s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unparalleled host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
“We all enjoyed coming to his chalet in Gstaad,” explains Heini&#39;s ex-wife Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to glory.
And despite this, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza representing Valentino
Argentinean model Valeria Mazza recalls the charismatic fashion designer.
One day we went to dinner at his house, after the fashion show in the Plaza de España in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy Jr.
Valentino&#39;s style manifested itself in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in its decoration, in food, in music.
&quot;Valentino made each of the guests feel important and loved,&quot; recalls the &quot;top model&quot;, whose work with the couturier began in 1995 during the Haute Couture Week in Paris.
“He never goes out of style because his sketches are real works of art,” she finishes.
The pedigree parade
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions, but of falling in love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous 60-meter-long catwalk that offers a role reversal: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade the catwalk, contemplating the &quot;spectators&quot; from dreams, sparkling with masterpieces from Valentino, such as the dress she chose Jacqueline Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in Night, or the wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of models such names as Sibylla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg shine.
Nati Abascal and fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, &quot;it is impossible to forget.&quot;
I remember him perfectly.
These were pants, a shirt, a &quot;vest&quot; and a jacket from the collection autumn-winter 1971-1972.
&quot;It was a gift he gave me,&quot; says Nati Abascal, one of the designer&#39;s muses.
&quot;I prefer him to others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty,&quot; adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they &quot;fit&quot; his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and trendsetter Patrizia della Jovampaola d&#39;Arenberg also cannot forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have an age and an excuse to wear one of his evening dresses ...
Finally, that hour came in the late 90s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear to a party at my cousin&#39;s castle, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red dress, with a ruffled skirt, pleated bodice, and a strapless neckline.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d “Arenberg&#39;s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d &quot;Arenberg keeps her party dresses from the designer with the utmost care ... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories that accompany it.&quot;
&quot;King&quot; of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller&#39;s wedding dress for her 1995 wedding to Pavlos of Greece.
It took four months of work and 25 &quot;girls&quot; (as the designer calls her seamstresses) to make this outfit from ivory silk inlaid with pearls, twelve different types of lace and a four and a half meter train.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority in the specialized press, the dress represents a milestone in haute couture at the end of the 20th century, &quot;the return of high society clients.&quot;
Intoxicated for many years by the &quot;lifestyle&quot; of the elite, now Valentino himself is its best representative.
Knight Grand Cross (the highest rank in Italy), Commander of Labor, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, awarded the Order of the Legion of Honor, Garavani has collected as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
“His refinement, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance have always attracted my attention,” recalls d “Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d&#39;Orsay.
He sat at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, a great friend of mine.
&quot;He was impeccable, time does not exist for him.&quot;
If this is the princess speaking ...
Hardest profession in the world: miners from Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by hauling 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of the volcano along steep rocky paths
There are people for whom their work is hell, while others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who make a living mining sulfur in the Kawah Ijen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where the sulfurous gas rising from the depths of the Earth solidifies upon contact with air.
He splits off huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, loads the baskets on his shoulders and carries them up the steep rocky road.
The peak of the volcano, which is 2,386 meters high, is only 250 meters, but emaciated loaders take more than 40 minutes to climb at a snail&#39;s pace, with difficulty maintaining balance and carefully feeling the way so as not to stumble or fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as happened to a tourist from France who fell several years ago from the rocks of Kawah Ijen.
Miners from Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulfur they mine
Once at the top, they make their way between tourists, who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, wearily carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales, which the mining company placed just above, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
We are talking about PT Kandy Ngrimbi, the company that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, better not to say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro cents) for every kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, as the mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
&quot;Since carrying 70 kilograms is the norm, we earn about Rs 46,000 (3.8 euros) for each trip,&quot; explains Anto, who usually does three daily transports.
He spends three hours on each and feels overwhelmed in the end, but they allow him to save 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
While this seems like a minuscule for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
&quot;The daily wages for miners are very high by local standards, where they pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day to collect coffee and an average monthly wage of 2 million rupees (167 euros),&quot; explains a loader who used to work as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali. ...
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the plot was not that hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as sulfur: &quot;I married a girl from Bali, where there are only Hindus, and brought her to Java to convert to Islam.&quot;
Anto has asthma, has difficulty breathing, constantly coughs and watery eyes due to toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawah-Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, has difficulty breathing, constantly coughs, and has watery eyes from the toxic gases that the volcano gives off.
This is the price he must pay to achieve his dream.
&quot;I&#39;ll work for another two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,&quot; he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and intelligent young man might be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist at a hotel, but instead he is doing the work of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning, because the sulfur never stops flowing out at night, when its characteristic yellow turns to blue and glistens in the darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, illuminating his path with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 porters drag baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high margins, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to porters who work on their own account and with such hardships.
In fact, they don&#39;t even get a fraction of the Rs 30,000 (€ 2.5) photography fee, which, along with the Rs 15,000 (€ 1.2) admission ticket, the guards of this reserve charge tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and his mule people.
&quot;This job is for livestock, not people,&quot; says Badrusin, a stocky 42-year-old porter who has spent three decades on Kawah Ijen since he left college.
Able to lift up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will tolerate work &quot;as much as he can&quot; because he needs money to educate his three children aged 18 to 10.
I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano is my whole life
Although sulfur burns their throats and burns their eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in dense columns of smoke emerging from the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains about their serious illnesses ... more serious, obviously, than their usual problems with breathing, arthrosis, knee pain and ulcers on the shoulders, which are deformed under the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can now only lift 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades carry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks to a warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among thickets.
&quot;I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano is my whole life,&quot; Unainik declares, opening his mouth wide, missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates, from generation to generation, one of the hardest occupations in the world: what the human mules of Kawah Ijen do.
Singapore seeks children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress, and housing and education prices for the absence of children.
&quot;The population of Singapore needs to grow.&quot;
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we will fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of an ad for mints, but despite this - or perhaps because of it - the video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like &quot;Let&#39;s put a bao (bun) in the oven&quot; to laugh at Singapore&#39;s birth rate.
The ad agency that made the video, BBH, cherishes the hope that through advertising they will be able to draw attention to the issue in an entertaining way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to harness the power of music to get people to fulfill &quot;their national duty.&quot;
This thing is exclusively for the web, so we needed to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing our own kind, so we felt that this is the topic that we should touch on.
We knew the government was trying to do a lot, like launching pheromone perfume or organizing quick dating (blitz dating) parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn&#39;t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don&#39;t we do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, which is to write rap?
1.2 children
Who does not take this so lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $ 1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for couples and parents provides up to $ 15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and provides tax breaks.
But all this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a wealthy and high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and strict social control.
The fertility rate in Singapore, according to its National Population Administration, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what is known as the replacement percentage - was in 1976.
So why don&#39;t Singaporeans have more children?
Tang Wei Ming, director of the Married and Family Policy Division of the National Population Administration, says the reason is &quot;improved education&quot; and &quot;a wider range of career opportunities.&quot;
“This allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities beyond marriage and starting a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms are contributing to an increase in the number of singles and the postponement of marriage and childbirth, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that aims to dramatically increase immigration to counter population decline is causing outrage among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where barely disguised xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not wanting to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore&#39;s ruling party got its worst election result last year since independence.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem with quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in fertility has a known impact on the nation&#39;s economic growth, tax revenues, medical spending, and immigration policy, the Singapore case is also starting to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts not to build so many small housing units.
For example, it started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development leadership shifted to overseeing the number of small apartments known as &quot;shoeboxes&quot; that could be built in certain areas of the city.
This 46 square meter apartment is selling very well.
However, it has been argued that they can promote single living and discourage property developers looking to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of homebuilding firm EL Developers, says their shoeboxes are selling much faster than their larger ones.
They are more popular in the sense that such apartments are sold out for several days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash flows increase.
However, he acknowledges that the new regulations provide clearer guidance for developers who have previously been barred from offering too many small apartments in a project.
Too overstressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the center&#39;s financial district, it seems like they won&#39;t have much of an effect.
“People are very overworked, housing is expensive, as well as education, and because of this, many people are putting it off,” says the young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and housing and education prices as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how hard the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, when it comes to childbirth, the Singaporeans have the final say.
Personal offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language, we are talking about the property of the private or &quot;area of privacy, which have the right to protect against any interference.&quot;
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when discussing situations on the Internet that he probably would not share outside the Internet?
elPeriódico interviewed five guys from ten to 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
On four occasions, they associated the term with “something very mine,” on a personal level, and “password and username,” when they applied it to social media.
“My biggest secrets I wouldn&#39;t post,” says ten-year-old Jorge as he tries to explain the meaning of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
&quot;These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world,&quot; he says.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I also have fun with my friends.
&quot;I would not share a photo that is not mine, or someone who is acting stupid,&quot; he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to post obscene photographs of naked people, crimes, or write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge says that he knows 35 friends that he has on FB, and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother knows she has a password for one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just download them,” he adds.
&quot;Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,&quot; he points out.
Without hesitation, he replies that he would never accept a request from an unfamiliar person.
I would not reckon with someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teen has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter admits that he does not know the 20 people he has added to his friends list.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t scare me because we have something in common, music, for example,&quot; he points out.
According to the boy, no one rubbed into his confidence and did not ask for his home address or phone number.
&quot;If they press me or demand, I&#39;ll just remove them from my account,&quot; he admits.
Jose became an Ask follower after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is known today as cyber-bullying.
One of my friend&#39;s acquaintances was blackmailed on a social network.
He was threatened and extorted money.
&quot;He never found out who it was,&quot; he assures.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
&quot;Just turned on privacy.&quot;
He then explains the sequence of steps to set up an account in a secure manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do it if I don&#39;t like the person or if I want to.
&quot;Although I know this is cyber-bullying,&quot; he confirms.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and education and training specialist, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, you need to understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
&quot;The Internet emerged as a way to find information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed,&quot; she notes.
Porras points out that Academician Mark Prensky, Master of Education at Yale University and author of Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital natives are they, children and youth, who were born in the age of technology.
“We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are still learning,” she says.
Explains that this topic is difficult, &quot;because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or said, at an age when the maturity is not enough for this.&quot;
&quot;Also, they should be selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,&quot; she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what privacy is to children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
&quot;Telling them not to do this is useless,&quot; she adds.
Porras then lists some options: there are things you wouldn&#39;t tell a stranger, so why are you doing this online?
Or would you like it if they posted a photo of you like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When captioning party photos, do you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you are doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they should behave online in the same way as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
&quot;Off the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, so should be in social networks,&quot; she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, university lecturer, professor of elementary education and educational consultant, explains the need for heads of households to read social media policies in good faith.
Understanding each of the points, they have a good basis for talking with children about the prerequisites for opening an online account.
&quot;For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish,&quot; he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key question is to remind the children of the lesson &quot;don&#39;t talk to strangers.&quot;
UNASUR summit ends without promulgation of the Lima Declaration
The 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without promulgating the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by seven obligatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to get access to the document signed at the 6th regular meeting of the heads of state and government of UNASUR, however, sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration indicated on the main page that it would be handed over after the closure, but then confirmed that at some point it would be published on the web -the website of the Peruvian government.
When asked about the text, they indicated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief press statements.
Journalists&#39; access to information about the Summit was always restricted.
During the day, only a video of the presidential assembly was broadcast, in the press room, without sound, with the message &quot;closed meeting, sound prohibited.&quot;
The little information that circulated among the reporters was conveyed by the spokespersons of some of the UNASUR governments attending the meeting, but not the Peruvian one.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of participating presidents, which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian presidential administration sent an e-mail to the media with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but this is about Umala&#39;s statement, not the official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and that time, despite the press insistently demanding it, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not disseminated either.
On the official website of the ASPA it is possible to verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that transmission systems were provided for all journalists, but limited the receipt of information as much as possible.
The summit also ended with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to accept the verdict of the Hague Court, which will resolve the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, gathered at a regional meeting and ratified that they will abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which starts hearing from both sides in The Hague on Monday, as part of the indictment that Lima has brought against Santiago.
“We will abide by and implement a judgment that will clarify the differences that we are currently submitting to this international court,” said Umala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
&quot;Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of differences, pacts and international tribunals,&quot; added Piñera, and greeted Humala with a shake of the hand in front of the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will obey the International Court of Justice comes immediately after Colombia challenged the Pact of Bogotá this week, according to which it admitted submission to the verdicts of that international court following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered erroneous.
The summit took place in the absence of the Brazilian Presidents, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening discussions in the morning and closing the summit just after noon Lima time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he said that 16 agreements were adopted and directions of action for 31 projects among South American countries were approved, the amount of estimated investments amounted to $ 17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take &quot;important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding residence agreements.&quot;
He said that action is being taken to improve &quot;cooperation against citizen insecurity and organized transnational crime, action to increase the availability of medicines, affordable Internet access throughout South America, and taking into account the risks of natural disasters in an integrated and effective manner.&quot;
With Europe in crisis, &quot;(Latin America&#39;s) economic unification should not have a triumphant foundation, but should serve to expand our production base and foresee a better future for our cities,&quot; added Humala.
“We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of South America, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and creating new economic schemes,” the Peruvian president said in a read-out message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five are in Peru, and are limited by transverse axes in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, however, he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to re-join the Union of South American Nations,” from which she is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have good relations between neighbors was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before embarking on the regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate in a respectful manner on the maritime dispute resulting from the international verdict. court contested by Bogotá.
&quot;The day after tomorrow (Saturday), I might meet with President Daniel Ortega,&quot; Santos said.
&quot;We will reconsider all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua,&quot; he stressed.
“With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the country&#39;s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also within the framework of the summit, the bloc&#39;s defense ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which is aimed at strengthening dialogue and unanimity on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the latter is suspended.
Peru has an interim presidency in the regional bloc.
&quot;South America must learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship&quot;: Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, reaffirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which &quot;South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe.&quot;
Correa, who attended the 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, told Peruvian state television that Europeans &quot;killed each other in World War II&quot; and in other clashes, &quot;but now they are practically the same fatherland.&quot;
He defended, in this context, the project for the establishment of South American citizenship, which is approved by the member countries of UNASUR.
&quot;It is necessary to achieve free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past,&quot; he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian president showed himself to be a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San Jose Pact on Human Rights.
Lecturers never make any commitments, while we South Americans, on the other hand, sign everything.
&quot;It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States,&quot; he said, alluding to the political asylum given by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision, because with it he did not betray his principles, but observed his &quot;deep values of democracy and human rights.&quot;
He added that at one time &quot;there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be followed.&quot;
He also criticized the Swedish justice system for requiring them to come to its territory for interrogation regarding the alleged sexual offense, while &quot;the Swedish law itself considers it possible to implement it through videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.&quot;
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration in Assange&#39;s physical and mental health.
&quot;I have not spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,&quot; the Ecuadorian head of state said.
What there really is is the danger of deteriorating his physical and mental health due to imprisonment in a small space without the ability to do exercises in the air.
&quot;It affects everyone&#39;s health,&quot; he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum issue afforded to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the provision of an immunity guarantee that will allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stressed that there were negotiations in London to search solutions to the problem of imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not conduct negotiations on human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
&quot;The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because Assange&#39;s lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of proceedings in various European instances,&quot; he said.
And he expressed the opinion that &quot;if the UK provides a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it will end.&quot;
And if Sweden, as her legislation perfectly allows her and as she has done in other cases, interrogates Senor Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype, tomorrow this problem will be settled.
Correa seized the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he does not tolerate &quot;mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort freedom of expression.&quot;
&quot;The main enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupted politicians, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said.
In this aspect, he was pleased that neither these journalists, &quot;neither bankers, nor bourgeois hegemonic countries dominate Ecuador,&quot; and added that, being re-elected, &quot;he will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction.&quot;
Correa also supported the decision to maintain Paraguay&#39;s veto in UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization &quot;must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the guise of legitimacy&quot; because in reality &quot;it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.&quot;
In addition, the Ecuadorian president considered the desire of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now &quot;completely justified&quot; after the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which turned out to be in favor of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not being respected.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
You need to work them out together in order to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed the hope for a good end to the dispute over maritime boundaries between Peru and Chile in the same court, and said that &quot;it is right for Latin America to apply to international authorities if the two countries undertake to make a decision, no matter how difficult it may be&quot; ...
Regarding the opportunity to run as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to run for a third consecutive term, he indicated that he considers this opportunity &quot;with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult.&quot;
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
&quot;My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to admit this responsibility,&quot; he said.
If won, this would be my last term as president, and then we leave public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
&quot;This is a decision,&quot; he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez&#39;s new treatment in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went for treatment that was already planned, routine, and that he is expected to skip the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean aggravating the health condition of President Chavez,” he explained.
The Ecuadorian head of state took part in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) today in Lima, which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today - the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was announced that his AIDS test had been positive.
“It was as if I was stunned,” he recalls that difficult moment, despite all the tact of the doctor.
The young man hid it from his family.
Deciding to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn as much as possible about it. And his efforts paid off - he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the &quot;oldest&quot; patients in the HIV department of Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he entered in 1994 after overcoming many obstacles.
He has been living with the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 90s, it would have been hard to believe - there were too few treatment options then, they knew too little about the disease, they were too biased towards patients.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute for Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, &quot;because he had a cut.&quot;
In other words, in those days it was a death sentence to have AIDS.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do it without compromising the quality of life.
However, unaware of their illness, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, &quot;depleted&quot; their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, &quot;a great achievement at the moment is that the survival of the patient who starts treatment on time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV department HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, citing the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectionist and HIV / AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have come to the conclusion that AIDS is not a death sentence, but life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients have at the beginning of diagnosis, with a better expected duration lives of those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with a 200 CD4 count, and up to 50 years when a 500 CD4 count is reported.
In simple terms, the above means that someone who is diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25, according to these terms, &quot;by maintaining control, will be able to live without problems until the age of 75,&quot; he explained.
To appreciate this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients died in the national database.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there have already been 187 deaths by May of this year; however, it is argued that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- Personally, it seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment.
This is how I imagine it, this is how things are in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they do not know about their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He cited devastating data: &quot;Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some kind of opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection in on a massive scale, for all people who ask for it. &quot;
Specialists and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA) agree in their proposal, as well as patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned to a private laboratory for testing, prompted only by the fact that his friend did it and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi&#39;s sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they will die and do not want to know anything.
&quot;If I die anyway, I&#39;d rather get drunk three times a week,&quot; they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, exercise, take medication.
Today, his parents only know that he has suffered cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
&quot;I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and the other person,&quot; listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to encourage those who are in fear now in the context of World AIDS Day.
Let them be checked, if there was a risk of infection, let them find out as soon as possible if they are HIV-positive, it’s better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them find out that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This post summarizes the fight against AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara-based journalist who has tackled the HIV problem.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, “in fact, the distribution of condoms has increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, which is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to condom, &quot;he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
&quot;Why do you need them?&quot; it is a popular question, with malice and condemnation, from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and health workers, that teenagers do not want to hear, the propagandist assured.
I propose to change this inefficient allocation; so that condoms are not only behind the shelves and that hundreds of them are in vending machines in public toilets in places frequented by young people.
This is not an encouragement of promiscuity.
It&#39;s not about paying for a beer and a motel, Governor Emilio Gonzalez replied when asked if condom distribution was possible under his leadership.
&quot;This is not sexuality, it is best to make condoms available to those who are already sexually active,&quot; he said.
Key data in Jalisco
13,435 total cases were registered (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th in the national rankings for new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections are in the genital tract, 6% through the blood and 2% in the perinatal tract.
It is estimated that 50 thousand people can live with HIV, since there are 4 to 5 people per registered case who do not know about it.
Given the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of the decision that reverses the Vitro Group&#39;s debt restructuring achieved through bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a fateful precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in a neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures to support the survival of firms, which are permitted by Mexican law, are not valid in the land of stripes and stars, contrary to international agreements.
In practical terms, the June 15 approval of Judge Harleen Hale&#39;s decision in the Texas North District bankruptcy court leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of seizure of property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door for Mexico&#39;s leading glass manufacturer to the United States Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the judge of the case notes that creditors should be governed by the US Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings relate to the bankruptcy proceedings pending in Mexico.
The first point implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of enterprises of a transnational profile.
In fact, for this purpose, the UN Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created, defining the American Institute of Law as the arbiter.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without an inter-firm vote, the debts that Vitro subsidiaries owed to the parent company to the parent company, recognized in the critical mass of bankruptcy proceedings, would not have reached the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debt was guaranteed by the Federal Institution of Bankruptcy Proceedings.
It is also true that by subtracting the affiliates&#39; votes, Vitro&#39;s creditors who fought against it in the United States courts, vulture funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 percent to 37 percent.
The Court of Appeal omits these data.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, affected by the severe economic crisis that hit the United States, striking the country.
So far, the firm of the Gonzalez Sada family will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself, so that the vote reaches its plenum, that is, five judges, since only three voted.
Failure to do so will result in a petition for certification that will require a review of the process by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government in the role of amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;), which describes the process that Vitro follows under the Bankruptcy Proceedings Act, signaling that it is exempting itself from complying with agreements. signed by both countries to link it to Section 15 of the US Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Cannon from two sides: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Overall balance
Given the months-delayed complaints posted on the table by Mexicana de Aviación unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Aviation Pilots Association has already found a bottleneck.
The court, headed by Carlos Diaz Chávez Morino, has just filed a criminal claim against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisor systematically refused to report to the Republic&#39;s Attorney General&#39;s office regarding an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the IXE Bank Trust Fund F / 589, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be used to purchase shares in the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Askarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Surround Dragon Mart
Gathering over the weekend at a forum at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of general civil society endorsed the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, of a gigantic center for the sale and distribution to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of the products of an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for the employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to confront the monumental forces that have razed to the ground part of the protected areas and put forward serious threats against the industry.
Death of ACTA
Regarding the government&#39;s rejected request by the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA in English, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute, the case has already been archived.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of considering it as violating freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debt without affecting short-term debt, homebuilder Homex is placing 500 million pesos of exchange certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical, with an offer of interest payments every 28 days.
Competival is born
Formed by the information technology leaders NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, the Competival consortium has just emerged to target the software cluster services market in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $ 1.5 billion.
Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes: &quot;Basketball was my life&quot;
Inveterate basketball traveler Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes has been involved with the sport for over 60 years and has traveled all over the world thanks to him.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many basketball stories as Hector “Hetin” Reyes.
And after all, before a cerebral hemorrhage confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for over 60 years, as a small player, a Major League basketball player, commissioner and chief executive of BSN with the Bayamon Cowboys and president of the Basketball Federation. ...
&quot;I have played many basketball roles throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was BSN President, National Team CEO and Federation President in the 90s,&quot; Reyes recalls during Primera Hora&#39;s home visit. in Bayamon, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife, for over 50 years.
&quot;Basketball was my life.&quot;
Reyes is not exaggerating in making this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all adorned with photographs and memorabilia collected over his long journey, bear witness to this.
Bayamon in the heart
With his greatest emotions, he retains those that remember his journey through the Cowboys, from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old as a co-agent or contract agent.
“Those were my best years and I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight Cowboys Championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Minsy made his BSN debut.
From that moment on, &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over in charge, &quot;Reyes pointed out.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who was heading here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: &quot;I have a very strong player for you, 6&#39;7&quot;.
&quot;Do you want?&quot;
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended the sniper Raymond Gauss, who became one of our top scorers.
I remember saying that if Mingsey had brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the championship of the Cowboys with Gauss, but at a distance, because by 1988 I was already the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his and Minsey&#39;s achievements on the national team.
I remember winning the first time against the United States during the 1989 Olympic qualifier in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we got fourth place and it should have been bronze, if not for the Canadian referee who forced us to replay the final game, Reyes said.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you&#39;ve ever seen?
She is among the best, just like the one that won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and beat the US team, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the World Cup.
That team not only played again Minsi, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and &#39;Pikulin&#39; (Ortiz), but also young (Javier) &#39;Tonito&#39; Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &#39;Quixote&#39; Morales, who was unable to compete in 90 due to a knee injury.
The team that may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and a lot of joy, was the team for the 1995 Olympic qualifying tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role-playing players like &#39;Canito&#39; Nieves, Pablo Alisea and young Rolando Hurruitner replacing players suspended for the mess in the Pan American Championship in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all expectations.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Pikulin Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level the way Pikulin did.
And that&#39;s without considering his career in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That&#39;s a very difficult question.
We had very good youngsters including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
As a young person, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider to be your main achievement in the federation?
Participated in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What is left for you to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, like regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, for the boys from Ponce to play only in their own area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys travel and play too much, and this is unnecessary.
At least I see the fruits of the mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Died actor Larry Hagman
Born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, Larry Hagman became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as &quot;J.R.&quot; , angry and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil predator JR Ewing on the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as JR this year for Dallas&#39;s new season, died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., Dallas&#39;s production studio.
“Larry is back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he loved the most,” his family said.
Larry&#39;s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving Fair.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was next to Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her spokesman Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to everyone who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented and I will miss him very much.
&quot;He was an original person and lived a full life,&quot; Gray confirmed in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted to drinking for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and underwent a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman rose to prominence on television for his role as the decent guy in the light comedy &quot;I Dream of Jeannie,&quot; which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive genie girl, played by Barbara Eden, and begins living with her under the same roof.
He also starred in two rarely-aired comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film work has included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the deliciously hideous JR that brought Hagman to the top of his stardom.
A CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its environment aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan &quot;Who Shot JR?&quot;, Conceived to create a buzz around the emotional episode in which Hagman&#39;s character is nearly killed, has spawned international debate and millions of dollars being risked at the bookmakers.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at that time.
When answered in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and made Dallas the second most viewed entertainment program in history, after the 1983 MASH finale, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was JR&#39;s sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
JR interfered with her and then threatened her that he would accuse her of prostitution if she didn&#39;t get out of town, but others had reasons to attack him as well.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt official with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be placed on treatment.
&quot;I know what should be on JR&#39;s tombstone,&quot; Hagman said in 1988.
It should be said, &quot;Here lies the honest citizen JR Ewing.&quot;
This is the only trade he lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone &quot;huge, both on and off the screen.&quot;
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who are fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas episode aired a few months ago to great acclaim on TNT.
The recording of five episodes of the second season had already been completed and the sixth was in production, the channel said.
Warner or TNT have yet to make any statements about what will happen to the series after Hagman leaves.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who has starred in classics such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on New York theater stages in the early 1950s and then served in the England Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met and married a young Swedish artist Mai Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, home to many celebrities.
In 2001, he titled his memoir Hello Darlin &#39;: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
“I didn’t include anything in there that I considered capable of hurting or influencing anyone in any way,” he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he promoted organ donation and volunteered at the hospital to help patients with fear.
“I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go to surgery, and after,” he pointed out in 1996.
I&#39;m trying to offer some consolation, like &quot;don&#39;t be afraid, it&#39;ll be a little uncomfortable for a short while, but you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;
He also actively campaigned against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
A course that explores End of the World begins
Each week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when professor of religion Stuart Sharme decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible bait: the end of the Mayan calendar&#39;s &quot;long countdown&quot;, December 21, which many people have seized upon as proof that the end of the world is coming. ...
But Sharme had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call &quot;long-armageddon,&quot; and the growing conflict that would involve Israel, a place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
&quot;I didn&#39;t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of them all,&quot; Sharma told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you analyze what is happening in the world at the present time, as if we only have 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember, bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he&#39;s not the only professor to offer doomsday courses in this theoretically last semester in history.
At Temple University, Associate Professor Barry Wacker teaches a course in Media, Culture and the End of the World.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We are analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, and the way hypothetical scenarios are proposed that cause certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real life examples.
“I tried to educate students about what is possible, probably, plausible, and impossible,” Wacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to teach a course called simply End of the World.
&quot;We&#39;re not adding &#39;2012&#39; to always be able to read the course again in case the world doesn&#39;t end,&quot; Restall said.
Despite the &quot;inevitable destruction&quot;, students must study, prepare projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work &quot;until the very night that the world is supposed to end,&quot; Restall said.
The courses have proven to be quite popular.
&quot;Places ran out in two hours,&quot; Restall said of his course for students with a high GPA, which had 35 students.
We received emails in the weeks leading up to the semester from people asking if there were more places.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
“I love to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Vekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he watched all the apocalyptic films.
&quot;I&#39;ve never heard of a course that taught this,&quot; he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students surveyed - let alone the professor - said they believed in the end of the world on December 21.
“Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and in some way we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old graduate student at Temple University in West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it&#39;s just a key moment on the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back several centuries, where people react to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The internet has triggered an increase in this speculation.
“In other places, people don&#39;t think about it,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, was quick to answer if he knew of any &quot;end of the world&quot; course there.
&quot;The Philippines does not take part in the end of the world,&quot; he wrote, alluding to the order from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that for a long time there was talk of many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, &quot;people will immediately start thinking about the next date&quot; or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period, after whose world will end.
Students and teachers are reckless about this date.
Some said they were going to do end-of-the-world parties.
“Maybe I’ll call some of my friends to laugh together,” commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
