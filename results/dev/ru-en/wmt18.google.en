Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law introducing administrative liability for violation of the term and procedure for payment for goods (works, services) when making purchases for state and municipal needs.
This law is intended to solve a very acute problem of non-fulfillment of their obligations by customers in the implementation of state and municipal purchases.
Two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not receive payment for already executed state and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the General Prosecutor&#39;s Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who entered into contracts not backed by funding, tried in every possible way to evade their payment obligations and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the whole country.
Since 2015, in the interests of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment for public orders, the prosecutor&#39;s office has submitted 9.7 thousand submissions, as a result of their consideration, 4.5 thousand officials were brought to disciplinary responsibility, 533 officials were brought to administrative responsibility, and to investigative bodies to organize procedural 75 materials were submitted, 46 of which were criminalized.
As a result, over 66 billion rubles in debt to entrepreneurs was paid off.
Moreover, these huge sums did not accumulate as a result of non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in paying for services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts led to fabulous debts.
Here is a typical case.
The head of a small company won a tender for the provision of social transportation services for several million rubles.
The person invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the due money on time.
The result is a growing financial lump of debts on salaries, taxes, loans, which would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not turned to the prosecutor&#39;s office for help.
Now, in a number of regions, the problem has been minimized as much as possible.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts revealed by the prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor&#39;s office operates in a manual anti-crisis management mode.
The Prosecutor General personally conducts field meetings with representatives of local authorities, at which all violations revealed by prosecutors and measures for their immediate elimination are examined in detail.
Such operational meetings have already taken place this year in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of Federal Law No. 189-FZ &quot;On Amendments to the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation regarding the establishment of administrative liability of the customer&#39;s officials for violation of the term and procedure for payment for goods (works, services) when making purchases to ensure state and municipal needs &quot;, which was signed by the President of Russia last week.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses with an article that provides for a fine from 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by an official of the customer of the term and procedure for payment for goods, works and services in state and municipal purchases.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offense, then he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already received instructions to ensure the application of these legislative innovations in practice.
Civil rights group issues travel warning in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning for people of color traveling to Missouri due to discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The group&#39;s statement reads: “The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People&#39;s Travel Warning, valid through August 28, 2017, urges African American travelers, visitors, and Missouri citizens to exercise extra caution and caution when traveling around the state due to a number of questionable incidents on racist grounds that have recently taken place throughout the state and are cited here. &quot;
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a recent Missouri law that made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits and a disproportionate targeting of minorities by state law enforcement agencies prompted the group to issue a travel warning. ...
“Your people are exposed to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of their skin color, they are beaten and killed, &quot;Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Missouri, told the Kansas City Star.
&quot;We hear complaints more often than ever before.&quot;
This is the first warning of this kind issued by the organization against the state of the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racial humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas during a trip across the state and was arrested by Missouri State Police without charge.
The warning also cites a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General&#39;s Office that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped on the road than whites.
“The purpose of the alert is to keep people in the loop and alert their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
&quot;People need to be prepared in one way or another, whether they take the bail money with them or let their relatives know they are traveling throughout the state.&quot;
According to the latest figures from the FBI&#39;s hate crime reporting program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, making the state the sixteenth in the state for the number of hate crimes.
Also, the travel warning is in response to a new Missouri law that will make it harder to prosecute a legal entity for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for travelers in Texas and Arizona after those states passed new immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which the ACLU believes should have been increase the number of checks based on race.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but recently civil society organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed in shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
Unidentified persons fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports, citing the Egyptian Ministry of Internal Affairs.
During the shootout, two people, including one policeman, were killed and three people were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed people in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the intruders was detained, the second managed to escape.
Rostourism supports the law on the cancellation of free baggage for non-refundable air tickets
The head of Rostourism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with the RBC TV channel that he has a &quot;positive&quot; attitude towards the adoption of a law on the abolition of free baggage allowance for non-refundable air tickets.
“It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage,” he stressed (quoted by TASS).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, there is no need to pay for the transportation of outerwear and a mobile phone in hand luggage.
&quot;It would be correct to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to declare this, to say that this is for outerwear, an umbrella, a mobile phone, an iPad or even some kind of computer, there will be no relationship,&quot; said the head of Rostourism.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the free baggage allowance for non-refundable tickets.
The point is that airlines can themselves determine the number of pieces and weight of baggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate pollution of Lake Baikal
At a meeting on the protection of Lake Baikal, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that in recent years, significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to identify funding sources, plans and executors for the elimination of pollution.
Mr Putin also instructed to carry out a full reclamation of contaminated areas.
&quot;It is necessary to sort out the facilities that continue to work here, the treatment facilities of most of them are worn out,&quot; RIA Novosti quotes the president.
He also added that the Russian Prosecutor General&#39;s Office should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems associated with the emergence of spontaneous dumps and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of the rest.
&quot;I want to emphasize this: not everything must be checked, here you also need to know the measure, but precisely - illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures,&quot; he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office announced a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of objects subject to environmental supervision.
Recall that on June 15, Vladimir Putin, during a direct line, stated the need to change legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural areas of a special protection regime.
The residents of Olkhon Island, which is part of the Baikal natural territory, told him about the problems with doing business.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergei Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are associated with a number of regulations.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by changing the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
A new temple will appear in Ugra
In the village of Sosva, members of the Rakhtynya community from the indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, together with residents of the Berezovsky district, are taking part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is a river bank, the temple will be clearly visible from afar, so it will serve as a lighthouse for fishermen.
According to community representatives, construction work will be completed this year, domes have been installed and church bells are available.
Igrimskaya electronic warfare fleet provided transport support.
The temple is named in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, since he is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosva, the fishery gives the settlers work and feeds them.
Locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write in their school essays about it as a local landmark.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why is the law obeyed in Singapore?
I am talking to local businessman Chang from an outdoor diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, and neatly stores the cigarette butts in an iron box he brought with him from the office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest trash can - about a hundred meters to it - and throws the bulls there.
The fine for rubbish in a public place is $ 500 local, Chang said.
You know, since childhood, I just developed a reflex: you can&#39;t throw a candy wrapper on the pavement, you will be instantly fined.
And now there are video cameras everywhere.
Indeed, the sidewalks of Singapore in the city center are as clean as in a museum.
Chang says that three months ago, his neighbor&#39;s 18-year-old son painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What ?!
Imagine.
He received ten blows to the buttocks with a wooden stick and spent a week in jail.
In general, corporal punishment is not uncommon in our country.
How the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws are combined in Singapore, the AIF observer understood on the spot.
Nobody here thinks about abolishing the death penalty, ”explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long been spitting on the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this matter.
If a person carries a large consignment of drugs or sells them, he is entitled to the gallows.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi airport: he was carrying 400 g of cocaine with him.
The Australian Prime Minister, threatening with sanctions, international human rights activists and even the Pope spoke up in his defense.
However, the guy was eventually hanged anyway.
After that, drug couriers diligently go around our country.
The point is this: in Singapore it is supposed that EVERYONE is obliged to comply with the laws, and not just modest and poor people.
It doesn&#39;t matter who you are - a millionaire, a deputy prime minister, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
There is only one option in this case: if a pound of cocaine is found in your possession, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you see signs with a bunch of warnings, you are simply amazed - how many bans there are in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly according to the doctor&#39;s prescription (!).
Upon arrival, the tourist will not be taken away from the gum, but it is worth sticking the &quot;gum&quot; in the subway, a fine of 1,000 local dollars will be slapped.
In four days, I met two people with white signs on their necks: &quot;I littered.&quot;
For a cigarette butt thrown past an urn, in addition to a fine, they are often sentenced to &quot;exile to the janitors&quot;: to clean parks and beaches for a week.
6 thousand rubles pays a &quot;criminal&quot; who has forgotten to flush the water in a public toilet, and when trying to cope with a small need for an elevator in a residential building, a special detector is triggered - the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the very exotic laws are bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of a houseplant (!): It is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers should not carry lighters on the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5 thousand Singapore bucks.
In general, the thought arises: no matter how hard you try, you will definitely break something.
This is not at all true, ”Muhammad Kabir-Qajariya, the owner of a local travel agency, tries to dissuade me.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone get charged for breaking them.
Why are they saved?
So that citizens do not relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
For example, if cigarettes are sold to a minor in a kiosk, then everyone will be punished along the chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge sum, the offender himself will be hit with sticks on the &quot;back&quot;, and the seller will also be flogged and sent to prison.
It is thanks to such harsh laws that delinquencies in Singapore are very rare.
Is this justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, got drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for a year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having drunk a portion of whiskey, knows: if they stop him, the police officer will not let him go for a bribe, they will impose a fine equal to the cost of the apartment and go to jail for years.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore &quot;Disneyland with the death penalty&quot; - a guest from the United States was horrified by the general wealth of its inhabitants, &quot;a frighteningly clean airport&quot; and &quot;cultivated nature.&quot;
Say, such things are unnatural, look artificial, and in principle it should not be so.
The first days in Singapore, and you are truly afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, you remember yourself if you went into the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the &quot;Little India&quot; area, and suddenly there is a &quot;break in the pattern&quot;: plastic cups are lying at the bus stop.
&quot;How is it?&quot; - you are surprised.
And so, - the Singaporeans grin.
Anything can happen.
Not for every such &quot;crime&quot; will be caught on the spot, but you should know: if you are found out, you will not be excused - after all, you have broken the law.
More often than not, this is enough for the person to behave normally.
Of course, the government in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh City, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras from tourists&#39; hands.
The center of Paris is full of dirty bums and beggars.
On our streets, too, not everyone is trying to throw garbage in trash cans.
Singapore, on the other hand, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, has become the quietest, cleanest and safest city on Earth.
Think about it.
This is human nature: remember, no one in Russia had a seat belt until they were fined.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And one must think that in Russia, people would also be happy with clean streets, no garbage in the metro, and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse an elevator with a public toilet.
Here&#39;s the corporal punishment - thanks, don&#39;t.
Otherwise, the laws of Singapore are at least worth taking a closer look at.
Nothing sacred?
Now the Trump White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The surest sign of a regime change is when it starts fighting the statues.
Americans understand this no worse than everyone else - hence the deliberately theatrical demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump government, no doubt knew what he was doing when he raised a symbolic ax over the Statue of Liberty during a bitter dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the president&#39;s proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
Let&#39;s be honest, Miller did not encroach on the statue itself.
Hordes of pleasure boat owners and Statue of Liberty artists would lynch him if he tried.
But he encroached on its meaning, and especially on the meaning that was attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled at Acosta: “I don’t want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is… a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are referring to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. &quot;
Miller got the facts right, but as he himself said, it&#39;s not really about history.
This is about the current sound of the amazing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not just any immigrants, but the poorest: &quot;Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming to breathe freely, / Unhappy scum of your abundant shores.&quot;
Never before have the &quot;unfortunate scum&quot; been so visible on our screens.
Miller did not study literary studies - he made it clear that Trump is not expected in America.
This debate over the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it really is a debate about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to put her words on the base of the statue after her death - knew very well that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to indicate the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she received a completely different name: Mother of the Exiled.
The combination of poem and image was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack against American nativism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the rightists though change it back.
The loud-mouthed Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist who heralded Trump&#39;s arrival, argued in 2010 that Freedom invites no one, rather it is an early neocon who carries America&#39;s flame to a world in darkness: “Freedom is moving forward.
She carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way in the United States. &quot;
Contrary to his custom, Limbaugh really hit the mark here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
Lazarus&#39; great creative achievement was to see her as the haggard, unhappy, but full of hope people would see her on the decks of ships after a long and often difficult voyage.
It means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with the words of hope and hospitality they dream of hearing.
And, of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is needed not to light the way, but to kindle hatred, which is the only source of their power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Blake praises the Scottish members of the UK national team.
Eilid Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scots in the UK national team
Neil Blake, director of game for the UK Athletics Federation, said the 16-man Scottish side at the World Championships will make &quot;a significant contribution to the team&#39;s game.&quot;
A record number of Scottish track and field athletes have been selected for the 2017 London Championships starting Friday.
Blake believes that &quot;something special is born&quot; in Scotland and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
“We know that and are trying to understand and will support as long as they have the potential,” Blake said.
“I&#39;ve talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they&#39;ve done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that what they have done has to be worked out.
British Athletics Federation: What they&#39;ve done has to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don’t know why the circumstances are this way, but it’s absolutely brilliant. ”
Several of the Scottish track and field athletes are vying for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m; and Eilid Doyle was chosen by the team as their captain.
&quot;Eilid is being shy.
Her captain&#39;s speech was great, &quot;says Blake.
“A lot of athletes, Scottish or not, and where they live or train, walked out of this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eilid put into her were wonderful. &quot;
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will run the 400m hurdles in her fifth World Championships, says 16 Scots in the UK is &quot;incredible&quot;.
The previous record for the most Scots in the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Leading the way is Laura Muir, a middle-distance runner who broke five British and two European records last year.
She will run 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O&#39;Hare, who will be competing in the 1500m race, is another Scot to look out for, having a strong season behind him, winning the UK qualifiers and the Annuals.
Doyle reminisces about his first World Cup, when Lee McConnell was the only other Scottish on the team.
The team captain says she is &quot;incredibly proud&quot; that so many of her compatriots not only made it to the national team, but in some cases will claim medals and fight for the final.
&quot;The captain of the national team is chosen by other team members, so it was a great honor anyway, but to know that your teammates voted for you and you were chosen is a very special thing for me,&quot; she added.
“Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who have made the national team.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all accomplished athletes who will strive to get on the podium.
What about my captain&#39;s speech?
Yes, I think she was good.
I just drew attention to the fact that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it&#39;s just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we will be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to enter his arena and take part in competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful. &quot;
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don&#39;t run for public office unless you&#39;re willing to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
Americans loved George Washington, but that did not stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism irritated him, of course.
But he didn&#39;t shut up his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said: &quot;You can take away the freedom of speech and we, deaf and dumb, will be led like sheep to the slaughter.&quot;
Now I will turn to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan&#39;s subordinates blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And this week the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor&#39;s subordinates called the lawsuit null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of &quot;so what.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s just Facebook,&quot; many will say.
But this is also important.
And that&#39;s especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is a remarkably popular Republican governor in a predominantly democratic state.
He is in second place in the approval rating of the country&#39;s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a die-hard reactionary.
He has demonstrated a strong hand in managing the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also cleverly uses Facebook as his primary means of connecting with his constituents and jokingly displays his bald head after chemotherapy on his page.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor&#39;s page - which is declared as an official public forum and is run by administration officials with taxpayer money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with The Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Chas defended the governor&#39;s actions, arguing that blocking comments was simply moderating them.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and haters who are malicious on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say their comments were respectful, meaningful, and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan is a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramana from Bowie, Maryland did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
&quot;I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed at his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news,&quot; she wrote in the comments section of the Post article.
&quot;I also don&#39;t like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it&#39;s so-called cheating, instead of admitting that they are dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens.&quot;
What the governor&#39;s subordinates call a &quot;concentrated spam attack&quot;, others would probably call &quot;an active lifestyle.&quot;
In the era of Facebook, it&#39;s easy to tweak your image by simply blocking out critics or erasing negative comments.
It is a much less dusty job than before, which required sending people out, collecting and burning newspapers with critical editorials, or arresting and gagging protesters.
But this is exactly what is happening now, only in numbers.
Haugen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first landmark decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to the US District Judge from Alexandria, James K. Cashheris, the chairman of the Loudon County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by banning a voter from her Facecbook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin was filed with claims by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn&#39;t be that hard.
In the days of Washington, the era of affordable postage took about the same upheaval as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters severely undermined his authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms &quot;Yurikola&quot;, &quot;Valerius&quot;, &quot;Belisarius&quot; and &quot;Porcius&quot; wrote letters to newspapers ridiculing Washington&#39;s decision.
According to historical documents compiled by the George Washington Papers online project, his office was littered with petitions criticizing his stance on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn&#39;t try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing with that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for the amenities at the Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty is looking forward to the amenities for the next three days when Renaissance East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Open Senior Golf Tournament.
The Northern Irish native who led the neighborhood at Archerfield Links and pushed towards the final round last year before losing to Paul Eales is assigned to a new seat and serves as the tournament spokesman on behalf of the club&#39;s founder and director, Jerry Sarvadi.
“I&#39;ve seen the Renaissance club build and we are seeing it come to success with this event,” said Rafferty.
“The players will see this pitch at its best and it is in excellent condition.
Jerry did a great job arranging this place.
He is an ardent supporter of this game and is proud of his accomplishments here.
This is a great demonstration for this field. &quot;
Englishman Eals is looking forward to his first championship title despite winning both the European Tournament and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“It&#39;s a really special feeling,” said the Southport player.
“I was unable to try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
Memories of last year are coming back, and for my wife and I, Sharon was a very special experience to win last year.
It was a really special time and we will always remember it. &quot;
Returning to battle on home soil Gary Orr, joining the European Senior Athletes Tournament after turning 50 earlier this year.
The event will mark his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“When you play at home, it&#39;s always a little more important,” said Helensborough resident Orr.
&quot;You want to perform well, but you feel this additional burden.&quot;
I played again with great pleasure and showed good golf.
I am happy with the way everything is so far. &quot;
on the pitch, the trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior senior champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAlister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs £ 5 per hour if there is one person in the car, and £ 10 if there are two or more people.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Tunnels of sorts over highways, capable of absorbing carbon monoxide emitted from cars, are already being tested on UK roads.
The country&#39;s transport agency, as reported by Autocar, has reported positive test results for a 100-meter tunnel installed on a highway in the north of the country.
The 6-meter-high tunnel is built from some of the latest polymer materials that are capable of absorbing harmful substances contained in car exhaust.
However, the creation of an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British intend to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce traffic on the roads, expand the use of commercial vehicles on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is caused by transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths a year.
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment of the disabled Mamaev to a fine
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment for disabled Anton Mamaev, who was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
TASS reports.
Earlier, the prosecutor&#39;s office asked the court to replace the term with a suspended one, explaining its request by the fact that Mamaev&#39;s illness &quot;prevents him from being in prison conditions.&quot;
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years of imprisonment in a general regime colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces soldier.
On July 19, the court released the man from custody at a retreat in the pre-trial detention center.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian &quot;golden land&quot;
When preparing dinner, Bardeen Degei does not use the stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai district in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually simply places a sweet potato, here called a “note,” right in the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken out and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on an earthen floor - she has no furniture - and this is where she does her housework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The lavatory is a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband&#39;s four wives and therefore was not assigned to work in the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many of the men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are also soldiers.
“No one dares to walk around the village after five in the evening,” she says.
This is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by publicly raising their hands in front of the occupying forces.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands has quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes an hour and a half flight from Jayapura, the provincial capital, to Nabir, and then a five-hour shake in a rented car.
There is no public transport here.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; corrugated steel roofs painted with rust in a variety of reddish shades.
Few of the Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners made it here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuans Mee Pago worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“It was unusual for us to wear these clothes,” Degei says, pointing to his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
&quot;We used to wear only leaves on our bodies.&quot;
Papua is Indonesia&#39;s poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in Asia.
But it&#39;s also an Indonesian gold land.
The world&#39;s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a highland province about the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined approximately $ 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts an estimated $ 78 billion in forest reserves.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that the powerful Indonesian military maintains its suffocating presence here.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $ 20 million, including up to $ 150,000 to one officer.
Demands for greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this gold mine and are ruthlessly suppressed.
Since 1969, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian military, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned, according to human rights activists.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We will lose everything, a report published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as summary executions, torture - particularly frequent, another report claims, rape and electric shock - and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because the accidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, who does research in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The nuts tightened as Papua&#39;s resources attracted an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province&#39;s 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese shops, &quot;varungi,&quot; sell fried chicken and a gado-gado mixture of vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to compete.
“Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market for less than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abet You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, because of work.
&quot;Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua - the mother-mother (women) of Papua - have lost their market.&quot;
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokovi, vowed to tackle inequality and human rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua&#39;s 29 districts, including Paniai.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Djokovi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for justice,” says Yow.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration, Djokovi Paniai experienced tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols around a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle burst out of the darkness.
The frightened children told them to turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one of the soldiers took offense at their tone and after a while returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk chased the children and beat them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Eimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to the nearby government electoral commission building, and the situation escalated the next day.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on the soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed vaita, a dance of the Papuan tribe mee pago: they ran in circles and depicted birdsong.
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police station and military base.
As the situation escalated, the soldiers were ordered by internal radio communication: &quot;If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them,&quot; it sounded like an official document seen by TIME magazine, but which was not published in local media.
Eremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kogo Koto district in Enarotali, sensed danger was approaching and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
Nobody wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned around, my left wrist was suddenly hit by a bullet,” he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn&#39;t know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the side of the assembled ranks of soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots,” he adds.
Local resident Alfius Jove was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Johannes told TIME magazine, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
&quot;I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him.&quot;
General Yotje Mende, Senior Inspector of the Papua Police, told reporters that his officers were only &quot;defending&quot; their base because it was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papua Police Commissioner Pujo Sulistijo said in 2015.
&quot;It&#39;s a matter of life and death.&quot;
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
News of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Djokovi delivered an impassioned speech in Jayapura in which he offered condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Viranto said he would set up a non-judicial organization to end historic human rights abuses.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
“Most of the violations happened long ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or early 2000s.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be passed, ”he said.
Viranto then backtracked, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he had no plans to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, &quot;Everything will be decided through the courts.&quot;
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; in the deaths of more than 1,000 people in a bloody vote for East Timor independence in 1999, said 11 human rights abuses in Papua had already been resolved, including the incident. to Paniai.
The families of the Paniai victims received such statements with grim disbelief.
“Over the past three years, I&#39;ve been asked four times, but there hasn&#39;t been any change at all,” says Johannes.
&quot;I&#39;m tired&quot;.
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
“I&#39;m scared,” he says.
&quot;I am afraid that the military will arrest me, I am afraid that they will shoot me.&quot;
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the inhabitants of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came for me,” he says.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai&#39;s neighboring Deyay district.
Clashes between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help take the unconscious man to the hospital killed one person and injured 17 others, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dove, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company&#39;s construction site office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at the officers, who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say a mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) fired into the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we were afraid of retaliation,” Dominggu Badii, 28, who lives near the hospital and saw the hurried delivery of the wounded, told TIME magazine.
&quot;I hid in my house for two days.&quot;
Deyay&#39;s parliament has demanded that the officers involved in the incident be held accountable and the mobile police brigade withdrawn from the region.
Paniyai has always been a sore spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is causing discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green, central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend Papuans&#39; rights by organizing sporadic kidnapping attacks and raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In retaliation, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and groundlessly detained by the military in recent years under the pretext of &quot;defending national independence.&quot;
Some never returned.
Among the population of Papua, Paniai is considered a &quot;sad, forgotten place&quot;.
Poverty increases discontent.
The small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is not available to the same extent.
The people here grow whatever they eat: mainly the note, but also some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can care for four to five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually save most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten tubers of a note cost only Rs 10,000 (75 cents).
Over time, the economic disparity between the indigenous Papuans and the new migrants who arrived in large numbers following the introduction of new flights to Nabire Airport increased.
The few existing vacancies usually go to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people do not want to stay in the village ... because there is no work or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudi and Basile Longchamp were deported from Papua for “lack of coordination with relevant organizations” despite being given rare videotaping permits.
According to Felim Kineh, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the Djokovi campaign to lift restrictions on media in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Now foreign journalists trying to report from the breakaway eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of media coverage means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua&#39;s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “diverse and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramanata Nasir brushed aside the group&#39;s statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that &quot;Indonesia is still a democratic system and has a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations.&quot;
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Dutch Human Rights Ambassador Kiis Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke the silence, praying “We want freedom,” according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will have new presidential elections in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokovi again.
“Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting,” says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Djokovi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of the threat from a greedy army, are mired in poverty, and their education and healthcare are in a miserable state.
Gobay says that the inhabitants of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote, given for Djokovi, a debt that he must pay.
“They don&#39;t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out a final symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military precinct.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” says Jacobus without looking up.
&quot;What else could we do?&quot;
A fire engulfs the Torch skyscraper in Dubai for the second time
A fire engulfed one of the world&#39;s tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to hastily leave the seventy-nine-story structure 337 meters high.
This is the second fire that has swept through the high-rise building - coincidentally called the Torch - in two years.
The building was evacuated, no human casualties were reported, and there was no operational news about the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor, ”a resident of the skyscraper, who identified himself as George, told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense Authority, fire brigades extinguished the fire at approximately 4:00 am local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it is working to provide shelter to the victims.
The incident could put safety issues back on the agenda for materials used in exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the Fakel administration after a fire there in 2015 revealed that the cladding, the outer panels used for decoration and insulation, suffered the most.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed the insulation system and cladding panels of the Grenfell Tower in London could have accelerated the spread of the June fire that killed about 80 people.
The growth of tourist flow in Ida-Viru County in June was minimal
As follows from the data that the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee received from the Statistical Office, in June 2017, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists used the services of hotel companies in the North-East, which is 125 people or 0.6% more. than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased, while the number of foreign tourists increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
The most noticeable increase in the region was the number of Russian tourists - by 8.9% or by 318 people compared to June 2016.
In total, in June 2017, 3885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed in Ida-Virumaa hotels for the night.

The situation with the dismissal may become clearer in the coming days.
Five soldiers killed in car explosion in Afghanistan
At least five servicemen were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the police, a car bomb exploded near the military checkpoint in the Girishk district the night before.
It is known about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new state of emergency occurred in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange office.
The exchange of fire between the attackers and the security forces continues.
The diver filmed a shark that bit his camera
Diver and explorer Greg Skomal captured on video a shark that bit his GoPro action camera.
The video was posted on Facebook by a division of the US Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, of which Skomal is an employee.
The incident took place on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeastern United States, specifies the Necn portal.
A man, while diving, tried to shoot a shark with a camera, which he held on a special stick.
Noticing a man, an animal over three meters long swam up to him.
The shark began to bite the camera without trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator did this to determine if the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noticed that such behavior of a sea animal was new to scientists.
The reason for the mass brawl in the Ural military center has become known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Elan training center, where the mass brawl took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this carnage have already become known.
According to the public Mash, which appeared on the VKontakte page, the contract servicemen of the Ural military unit No. 31612 fiercely fought over an unmade bed.
It all started with the fact that a private named Sayan defiantly ignored the officer&#39;s order to fill the protruding sheet.
Servicemen from the sixth company took the officer&#39;s side.
Sayan was supported by the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young guys smashed the beds and sinks in the barracks, knocked out the windows.
More than ten people were injured in the mass brawl.
The Central Military District denied information about the stabbing.
The study found that at least one-fifth of US passengers carry prohibited items on board.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items in their luggage through the US Transportation Security Administration&#39;s checkpoints, including at least 6 percent boarding a plane, inadvertently carrying illegal knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 percent reported that they later discovered that they accidentally carried firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
Research by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and reaching over 1000 people also showed that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that ATB prohibited, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X.
Food and water are deliberately passed by ATB employees.
More than 3 percent admitted that they deliberately smuggled sharp objects through the search, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents admitted that they deliberately carried illegal drugs onto the plane.
The company said it studied passengers across the country to find out how many of them accidentally smuggled through airport security checks, and how many did it knowingly.
It is quite expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously - smuggled smuggled through security by those who fly the most.
As the company points out, ATB&#39;s rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and in what quantities.
Therefore, it should come as no surprise that most of what ATB culls are banned liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB might consider books illegal to carry.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not international.
EPA chief Pruitt abandons intention to delay implementation of Obama&#39;s emission reduction rules
The day after the 15-state lawsuit, the head of the EPA reversed his decision to postpone the implementation of Obama&#39;s rules designed to reduce emissions of air pollutants and smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by the fact that his agency is now listening more than in previous administrations to the needs of environmental regulators in individual states.
He did not mention the lawsuit filed against his previous position in a federal appellate court.
The controversy revolved around the October 1 deadline for which states must meet 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot;inconsistencies with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth.&quot;
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma&#39;s attorney general before being appointed by President Trump to his current position, has long been known as a consistent opponent of environmental tightening.
Since moving to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly blocked or postponed regulations that were opposed by the chemical or gas and oil industries.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat for Pewitt&#39;s course of returning to old norms.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA chief had exceeded his mandate in an attempt to delay implementation of the Obama administration&#39;s rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and mitigate methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that, by dramatically changing course on ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA&#39;s responsibility to work with states in a comprehensive process to ensure that the new standards are enforced in a timely manner.
&quot;Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others and discussed timelines during the settlement process,&quot; said Pruitt, who has filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous role.
“We don&#39;t believe in regulation through litigation and we take the deadline seriously.
We also take seriously our charter and the power it gives us. &quot;
However, the EPA said in a statement that Pruitt may at some point re-use his “deferral and other statutory powers” to ensure that the “jcyjdfys” regulations are on a clear course and on all available information.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader revision of ozone regulations.
The bill, passed by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
&quot;The EPA&#39;s course change - following our lawsuits - is a major victory in the fight for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that covers their cities,&quot; Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia joined the New York lawsuit.
Ground-level ozone occurs when common pollutants from cars, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing problems in susceptible individuals, resulting in thousands of premature deaths a year.
Public health and environmentalists have welcomed Pruitt&#39;s unexpected change in course.
“It&#39;s sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical move from the person tasked with protecting the air we breathe,” said Laurie Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
&quot;We must continue to resist the Trump administration&#39;s ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.&quot;
IAAF Congress extended the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (ARAF).
Thus, Congress supported the IAAF Council for the Reconstruction of ARAF, which released a report on Monday, in which it recommended that the suspension remain in force.
166 people voted for the extension of the suspension, 21 against, reports TASS.
The IAAF Council report stated that ARAF has made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the Council for membership renewal, but these conditions have not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of ARAF at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to compete under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
ARAF was disqualified indefinitely by the IAAF in 2015.
Then the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was published, which spoke about the numerous violations of the WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.

Offensive defeat
As part of the 3rd round of the Russian Fonbet Championship among the PFL teams, Novomoskovsk &quot;Chemist&quot; played an away match against FC &quot;Kaluga&quot;.
A little more than 10 days ago, the rivals played among themselves in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
“Chemist” was in no way inferior to the opponent, but a second relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat from the Kaluga team with a score of 0: 3, many predicted an easy victory for the hosts.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the Novomoskovites were forced to reckon with themselves and acted from defense, but from a position of strength.
In the first half, Kaluga residents were more creative and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was played by Alexey Sirotin, who repelled dangerous blows several times and gave his partners confidence with his actions.
Unfortunately, in the attack “Chemist” did not have enough effort and luck to confuse the defense of “Kaluga” and score the first away goal.
After the break, the game began to flow on a collision course.
Novomoskovtsy played more actively in the attack.
Errors in defense, which allowed the Kaluga team to create a number of critical moments, became alarming signals for our team.
10 minutes before the end of the meeting, “Chemist” intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the Kaluga people played a role - they played the ending more competently and calmly, waiting for their moment to score.
After a dangerous attack, “Chemist” turned the ball to a corner, the supply of which was sent to the goal by the home team without resistance.
The goal was scored by Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, “Chemist” showed a good game, but suffered an offensive defeat.
Ahead of our team is waiting for another departure - on August 11 at 19 o&#39;clock in Moscow at the &quot;Torpedo&quot; stadium named after Eduard Streltsov, the Novomoskovites will fight with the favorite of the &quot;Center&quot; group FC &quot;Ararat&quot;, which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexey Rebko.
Come to support &quot;Chemist!&quot;
The place and time of the meeting of the Novomoskovites is 18 hours 30 minutes. near the store &quot;Magnolia&quot; (Vostochnaya, 2, bldg.
The composition of &quot;Chemist&quot;: Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogia (Oreshkin), Dudayti, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreichenko (Lygin)

Trump pressurized Mexico about paying for the wall at the border, according to published transcripts of telephone conversations
The Washington Post has published transcripts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieta, Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned border wall.
The US president scolded him for speaking out publicly against the wall and, according to leaked information, told him, &quot;You can&#39;t tell this to the press.&quot;
Trump began his campaign by promising to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowing to make Mexico pay for the project.
The published transcript of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a heated squabble.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US must accept refugees heading to Australia is &quot;funny&quot;, &quot;disgusting&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; and insisted that the deal made by the Obama administration would make him look like an idiot as he intended to stop the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that &quot;it was the most unpleasant conversation of the whole day.&quot;
The bodies of tourists killed in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane, belonging to the Rossiya airline, carrying the bodies of Russian women killed in Abkhazia, took off at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS reports.
At the place of the final destination, the board will be met by employees of the funeral agency, as well as representatives of the city administration, Astamyr Akhba, Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia, told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the republic said that all the costs associated with the delivery of the bodies back to Russia were borne by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay compensation to the families of the victims in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Akhba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed its readiness to pay the relatives of the tourists killed in the explosions for the flight and accommodation in the republic, but the relatives sent to the republic only powers of attorney for the right to local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorskoye, Gudauta region, two explosions thundered at the missile and artillery armament depot of the Ministry of Defense of the republic, after which large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there began to detonate.
As a result, the warehouse caught fire, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result of the emergency, two citizens of Russia died - Elena Polyakova, born in 1970 and Elena Timofeeva, born in 1962, who were on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were taken to medical institutions of the republic with injuries of varying severity.
Currently, seven people remain in the hospital, the rest have been discharged.
Grand Jury Examines Russia&#39;s Impact on American Elections
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington to examine Russia&#39;s influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offenses and have the authority to question witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be examined by the special prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to bring charges.
Convening a grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to take evidence.
One of the topics of the investigation by the jury, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting between the son of then presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian lawyer Natalya Veselnitskaya.
Mueller himself had previously promised to check the details of this meeting, which took place in June 2016.
They have already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. previously said that from a meeting with Veselnitskaya, he expected incriminating evidence on the headquarters of the Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton, but no revealing documents were presented, and it was ultimately about adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.&#39;s statement about a meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would have done.
Vice-mayor of Penza was detained at the workplace
The deputy head of the Penza administration, Irina Shirshina, was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at her workplace, RIA Novosti reports.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on this matter have not yet been received, but the press service of the Investigative Directorate of the Investigative Committee assured that they would follow soon.
The Penza City Hall has not yet commented on the incident.
Irina Shirshina is one of five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She oversaw urban planning and land relations, holding this position since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as the head of the State Housing Construction Inspectorate for the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina is raising three minor children, it is noteworthy that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she gave up maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no spaceport or launch vehicles in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop their own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person who visited space.
In contrast to the monuments of the Soviet period, which are being demolished in some countries, the monuments to Gagarin, on the contrary, &quot;walk the planet.&quot;
In 2012, the monument was installed in the American Houston near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was erected in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfoot, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 thanks to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin&#39;s 70th birthday, a monument to Yurius Gagarin appeared in Riga.
This is the first name and surname of the first cosmonaut in Latvian, and he looks as if he is 70 years old.
Murder at Morse Ford: activists will lose stage lynching to call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove past spectators in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and roared toward the small Morse Ford Bridge.
As the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, pulled up to the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
Chief, a middle-aged man in a pinstriped suit, took a drag on his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those inside were trembling with fear.
&quot;We need this nigga, Roger!&quot; the man barked.
&quot;Get him out of the car!&quot;
Shrill screams broke the silence as a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this gruesome scene, which took place on July 22nd, is only a reenactment.
But when a noose was thrown around the neck of &quot;Roger&quot;, almost all the spectators really held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night in which the Klans lynched two black couples in 1946 - Roger and Dorothy Malkom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one has been convicted of these murders.
“It&#39;s amazing that in all these years, not a single person has been arrested - although we see them next to us; although we know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
&quot;This is a stain on our history and this is a stone on our souls.&quot;
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia member of Congress who has fought for human rights all his life.
For him, the show is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the residents of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want an investigation, we want a conclusion, we want a healing, we want a reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he says.
&quot;We cannot move on to healing and reconciliation until we get justice.&quot;
A coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the Morse Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
More than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of lynching, according to FBI records obtained by NBC News.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights activists say the city has always been well aware of two associated vigilante motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens to vote for the first time in the primaries, which were to be held that summer.
Around the same election, the FBI reported that a black sharecropper Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in a fight, apparently over a woman.
Brooks says that rumors circulated in town that Hester slept with Malcolm&#39;s wife Dorothy, and that the child she was supposed to give birth to was not from her husband.
According to FBI reports, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $ 600 bail to get Malcolm out of jail.
He went to jail with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove out of jail and approached the Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of vigilantes surrounded the car.
&quot;It turns out that Harrison organized and commanded the killings,&quot; such a conclusion is made in one of the FBI reports.
&quot;It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between state and city law enforcement agencies, which not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed the evidence and hid the identities of the witnesses.&quot;
Brooks calls it shorter.
“It was an attack on voting rights,” he says.
&quot;They were all killed to send a signal to blacks in the city: if you register and vote, you will be the same.&quot;
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual performance of that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visual, it captures the viewer and tells the story of a deep racism that, as many would like to believe, no longer exists in America.
It is difficult to watch and even more difficult to turn away, but Green believes that this is the main thing.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to talk about lynching because they show us our own ugliness,&quot; she says.
&quot;But I can&#39;t build a relationship with you if you don&#39;t hear me or hear what I&#39;ve been through.&quot;
Rehearsals for this year&#39;s play began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest black - gathered indoors and listened to a polished review of the play over the years.
Wade Marbeau directed alongside Greene.
He played the role of the main member of the clan for several years, but says that the role has not become easier.
“I feel like I got dirty because this is not the person that I am,” says Marbeau.
&quot;But I think it&#39;s very important to remember this story because we don&#39;t want to go back to that time.&quot;
Indoors, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Raskona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, reprise their roles.
The show begins with Malcolm, furious that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, yells and pushes him.
&quot;I said, nigga, get out of my house!&quot;
Raskona yells back.
A blow is heard.
And at the same moment, everyone (at least all black actors) bursts into laughter.
Green laughs the loudest.
&quot;What is it,&quot; Ascona asks.
He is worried and confused.
Am I overplaying?
&quot;No,&quot; Green says through laughter.
&quot;I just don&#39;t think the whites were saying &#39;nigga&#39; back then.&quot;
&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; laughs one of the black performers.
&quot;You must utter a hard &#39;r&#39;.&quot;
And the energy in the room changes in the same way: discomfort is replaced by a sense of camaraderie.
Everyone must do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts over.
This time, when Raskona speaks a word with the letter &quot;n&quot;, it comes out clear and sharp.
Not a single person laughs.
The play ends violently and quickly.
Shouts, shots, and then silence.
A woman in black mourning clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and sings the sad song &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; by Billie Holiday.
Her voice is cut off through the word.
A hundred yards away, fifty spectators wipe tears and sweat from their eyes.
There are almost equal numbers of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York to watch the show; many live very close.
They all endured the heavy stuffiness of Georgia for nearly eight hours as Brooks took them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcolms and Dorsey.
Until this moment, the murders remained only history, but now, when they stand in the same place where people were lynched, it seems that their ghosts are hovering right there in the air.
When the last note of the song dies down, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend over to their heads, touch the paint depicting blood and motionless bodies, and whisper something to each other.
&quot;They&#39;re not really dead,&quot; one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself of this.
A few minutes later, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly it&#39;s all over.
The actors throw the ropes off their necks and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the costume who played the main Klansman.
Nick Raskona hugs the other two actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the performance finally fell on him.
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; one of the women whispers.
&quot;We know that you have a good heart.
You had reasons for that. &quot;
Later, the audience sit down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white Atlanta couple are animatedly discussing the show with a black couple they just met.
Denise Daplinski struggles to find words to describe how she feels after the performance.
“It&#39;s hard to listen to these terrible, creepy words and actions ... of people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she says.
“After that, I think the lynching is still happening,” she adds, “only now it’s called the police shooting.”
In another corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who recalls his work as a human rights activist, has taken over the general attention.
He says he has already begun planning for next year&#39;s show.
&quot;The production inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us,&quot; he says.
&quot;Because if you don&#39;t learn from this lesson, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it. &quot;
The court fined Navalny for violations at the &quot;campaign subbotnik&quot;
Moscow&#39;s Simonovsky Court fined Alexei Navalny 300,000 rubles for violating the procedure for organizing a rally.
The oppositionist was found guilty of committing an administrative offense under Part 8 of Art. 20.2 of the Administrative Code of the Russian Federation &quot;Repeated violation of the procedure for organizing a rally&quot;.
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky court of Moscow, Khyzyr Mussakaev, finished considering an administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the opposition leader&#39;s headquarters Alexei Navalny, who was prosecuted under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
This is how much Judge Mussakaev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the &quot;campaign subbotnik&quot; that Navalny&#39;s supporters carried out in Moscow on July 8-9.
Seeing the propaganda materials following the participants of the subbotnik, the police felt that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to first request permission from the city authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev petitioned to terminate the administrative proceedings due to the lack of corpus delicti and pointed out that the police made certain mistakes in drawing up the protocol.
At the &quot;campaign subbotnik&quot; itself, Volkov was not detained, but he received a summons obliging him to appear at the police station to tell about the event held with his active participation.
Navalny himself and another associate of the oppositionist, Nikolai Lyaskin, received the same summons.
Arrested in Mordovia who shot the bride and three wedding guests
A court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people at a wedding, including his bride.
This was reported in the republican department of the Investigative Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of July 29.
During the quarrel, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk fired several shots at the guests of the event who came to the village pond to swim.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case was initiated under paragraph &quot;a&quot; of Part 1 of Article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (&quot;Hooliganism&quot;), Part 3 of Article 30 and paragraphs &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;and&quot; of Part 2 of Article 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (&quot;Attempted murder of two and more persons, committed in a generally dangerous way, out of hooligan motives &quot;).
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire because the wedding guests, having decided to swim, walked along the territory of his site to the reservoir.
The Ministry of Energy will tighten requirements for suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for providing information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, hydroelectric power plant turbines, oil pumping and oil production facilities are launched, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share data on access to it with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft government decree is already ready and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will affect only &quot;critical energy equipment&quot; supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document are such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of an object by foreign special services, criminals and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
EU expanded anti-Russian sanctions over Siemens
The press service of the European Union announced on August 4 that the anti-Russian sanctions were extended due to the scandal over the supply of Siemens turbines to Crimea.
This was previously reported by &quot;Arguments of the week&quot;.
The press service of the EU Council stated that the sanctions against the Russian Federation were expanded due to the scandal with the Siemens turbines, which were allegedly delivered to Crimea bypassing the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member states to extend anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision would be made before the end of this day, and now the decision has been made, sanctions against Russia have been expanded.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and cuts dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the UK education group Pearson announced it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its preliminary dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program begins to tackle the challenges facing their businesses.
These job cuts, which company CEO John Fallon said will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it plans to cut costs by an additional £ 300 million ($ 394 million) in May as part of its third cost-cutting program to try to revive the business that has been hit by the rapid digitalization of learning.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 percent increase in core product sales in its first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, according to official sources, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, according to a NATO report.
According to unverified information from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the urban region of Karabakh.
The blast is the latest to hit Afghanistan this month of bloodshed, with more than 30 people dead in a mosque blast in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion on Thursday evening happened when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with a &quot;man-carried improvised explosive device.&quot;
According to the report, all of the wounded are in stable condition and are receiving treatment at the American military hospital at the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed nearby in Bagram.
According to UN reports, in the first half of 2017, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan, and about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide bomber blast in a car killed at least 30 people in the Shia region of Kabul.
The Taliban stated that they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive blast in the city center killed more than 150 people, the most fatal terrorist attack in the country since the United States ousted the Taliban in 2001.
The violence accentuates the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is assessing whether to increase the number of US military forces providing assistance to troops and police in the country.
The attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its line of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani, correspondents say.
EPA after lawsuits overturns decision to postpone air pollution law
The US Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to postpone the Obama-era bill that states must limit air pollution emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
On Wednesday evening, the EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called &quot;2015 ozone measurements,&quot; stressing that the move shows the agency&#39;s willingness to work with states.
“We believe in dialogue and responsiveness with our partners in the states,” EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA&#39;s intention to postpone ozone measurements, which measure existing air pollution across the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter air cleanliness standards, by one year, until October 2018. of the year.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit claiming the intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump&#39;s administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by outgoing President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says is aimed at brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has met with opposition from Democrats and environmental organizations, concerned about the potential impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s website states that breathing in air containing ozone &quot;can impair lung function and worsen respiratory symptoms,&quot; such as asthma.
Association of European Businesses opposes new anti-Russian sanctions
The Association of European Businesses expressed disagreement with the US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to the AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB said in a statement that business is one of the important connecting links between countries and people, so the principles of free trade should not be limited.
European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask police to restrict traffic on the embankment in Pskov
The Pskov people&#39;s deputies sent an appeal to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the city, Sergei Surin, about the problem of movement along the embankment of the Velikaya River.
City Duma deputies Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Storonenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and relaxing in this place.
In their opinion, the control of drivers will help make this area more calm and safe.
The problem is that offenders ignore the footpath signs and ride freely along the embankment.
It turns out that major repairs and landscaping were done in vain.
Sports and playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable due to cars.
As the Pskov information agency notes, in the evenings the central embankment is patrolled by police patrol officers and militiamen.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars becomes less, but the movement does not stop completely.
Putin demanded from investigating authorities not to seize hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed to prohibit the investigating authorities not to seize servers and hard drives from work computers at enterprises.
The head of state announced this at a meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary &quot;to exclude the use in the interests of the investigation of measures leading to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from work computers and servers.&quot;
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, &quot;it is enough to make copies, certify them and use them during the investigation.&quot;
The head of state added that it is impossible &quot;to create conditions that prevent the continuation of the enterprise up to the impossibility of paying taxes.&quot;

The Independent newspaper reported this on Thursday.
His relatives told about the death of the actor.

Something has rotted in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, but in fact Henri Marie Jean Andre, Comte de Laborde, refused to be buried with his crowned wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year the couple has a &quot;golden&quot; wedding, but the couple&#39;s agenda is not preparations for celebrations, but a grave dispute.
His Highness renounced the title of Prince Consort, while he sneered at the Queen that she never granted him the title of King Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains officially the queen&#39;s consort.
Russian Foreign Ministry urged Washington to stop defaming Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to the statements of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The Foreign Ministry issued a corresponding statement some time ago.
In its commentary, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using Cold War clichés that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the American authorities to stop defaming the Russian Federation.
As &quot;Arguments of the Week&quot; wrote the day before, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed coup d&#39;etat in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is a conversation about the possibility of a decisive fight
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be steadily moving towards hosting the most exciting 147-pound boxing match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied private rooms in ESPN&#39;s Los Angeles office space until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization&#39;s second featherweight champion.
After Garcia&#39;s unanimous victory over former four-weight world champion Arien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are among the top five boxers, regardless of weight class.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, “How are you, champion?
Good luck to you&quot;.
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for a photo, Lomachenko&#39;s manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential decisive fight between them would be just right.
“I used to be at featherweight,” Garcia recalled.
“I went up the category for Broner [up to £ 140], but I&#39;m not that big.
I&#39;m too small for 140.
I want to go down to featherweight.
And he needs to go up to featherweight [up to 135 pounds], and then we&#39;ll have a fight.
This is what the fans want.
Let&#39;s arrange it for them. &quot;
Lomachenko agreed.
&quot;Boxing needs this fight.&quot;
Klimas asked if the fight should be streamed via PPV as part of his strategy for Lomachenko to have his debut 135 fight later this year to set up a meeting next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 KOs). who is also interested in taking on the winner of the bout between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the world lightweight title at Forum Arena on 23 September.
“The fight could be on PPV, because all the fans asked for it,” Garcia said, expressing later his willingness to fight on the channel that offers the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other names will generate such interest.
As soon as they are ready ... &quot;
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko an &quot;amazing boxer&quot; and might attend his Saturday night fight.
But Lomachenko did not immediately shower Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the champion in three weights from Riverside looks &quot;very slow, sorry, Mikey ... you were asking for a knockout.&quot;
Garcia said he focused on showing the power of the punch and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension build up before their own fight.
“This fight must take place.
No other fight generates so much interest and talk.
I am more than happy to work on it, ”said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: “I was expecting some of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight. &quot;

Putin instructed the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the General Prosecutor&#39;s Office of the Russian Federation to check the territory of Lake Baikal for facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
&quot;I ask the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office to check the Baikal territory for the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities,&quot; - said Vladimir Putin at a meeting devoted to the environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked to take action if the facts of violations are revealed.
New test results published to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to the new medical age assessment method show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as over 18 years of age, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make age estimates in the asylum process more accurate after being criticized by the Swedish Migration Agency (Migration Agency) for failing to determine the real ages of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far, the Migration Agency has sent 6,880 cases for testing and the forensic agency has now published 2,481 test results between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of test takers were rated as 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the forensic science agency estimated that the test taker was &quot;likely to be 18 or older.&quot;
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was “probably under 18”.
Tests are carried out only in cases where a person&#39;s age is in doubt.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are in line with those of the past months.
“We don&#39;t see much difference with the statistics from the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate,” he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as over 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency released 581 test results and said 442 cases were &quot;likely to be 18 years of age or older.&quot;
However, after reviewing 581 published results, Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases the person openly declared that he was 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking x-rays of wisdom teeth and tomography of the knee joints and sending them to dentists and radiologists for analysis, has also drew criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, part of whose job is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I had reasons to think about it, and I do not think that it is necessary to use the methods of measurement that are used now.
The biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we cannot define it with certainty, we must not pretend that we can, ”he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Goeranssen of the Forensic Science Agency argued in favor of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, we can say that the risk of mistaking a child for an adult is small.
The biggest risk we face is when a person will soon be 18, in which case he is about 10 percent. &quot;
I will think about whether to run for president
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin announced that he was ready to think about whether to run for the presidency of Russia in the elections in 2018, Interfax reports.
This statement was a response to a request from residents of the village of Cheryomushki, Buryat Region.
During a video conference dedicated to the suppression of a fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: &quot;Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request for you: when the next presidential elections take place, we all ask you to run again for this post.&quot;
“Okay, I&#39;ll think about it, thank you,” the president said in response.
On July 28, the press secretary of the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the statements of some media that the head of the presidential administration of the Russian Federation Anton Vaino would head the election headquarters of Vladimir Putin.
Peskov called these assumptions &quot;unsubstantiated, hypothetical reasoning.&quot;
&quot;So far there are no headquarters, it is far from the creation of headquarters, far from the election campaign,&quot; said Peskov.
&quot;So far, this is not on the agenda,&quot; Peskov said.
Governor of West Virginia says he is going to another party
West Virginia Governor, Democratic Party spokesman Jim Justice announced on Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he was switching to the other party.
&quot;Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me,&quot; Governor Justice said.
&quot;Today I say to you with many prayers and many reflections ... today I say to you, the people of West Virginia, I can no longer be of service to you as a Democrat governor.&quot;
The meeting burst into applause.
“So tomorrow I will change my registration to Republican,” Justice added.
&quot;As a coach, I would tell you it&#39;s time to play differently.&quot;
Earlier, Trump promised that an important announcement would be made at the rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by a 42 percent margin, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $ 1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the GOP National Committee on Thursday night released a statement that &quot;Governor Justice&#39;s move is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is hindering rather than working to make our country great again.&quot;
&quot;With just 15 governors and control of the smallest state legislature in history, Governor Justice&#39;s announcement is just another rejection of a party that has no top-to-bottom leaders and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,&quot; CBS News said in a statement. Republican National Committee spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel.
Heavyweight cat Mister Handsome found a home thanks to social media
A cattery in Pittsboro, North Carolina, USA, has adopted a cat named Mr. Handsome weighing over 14 kilograms after he became famous thanks to the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was published on the cattery&#39;s Facebook account with a request to find its owner, because &quot;obviously someone had fed him before.&quot;
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal&#39;s muzzle could become a new meme.
The publication received more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15 thousand comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to shelter Mister Handsome.
As a result, he was placed in the hands of Angela Frazee, who promised to take care of his excess weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, the American said that she already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users noticed a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.
The post with a photo of the animal has received more than 68 thousand views.
Commentators noted that she could well have made a career in the modeling business.
Coe praises Russia&#39;s &quot;sincere&quot; apology over doping scandal
International athletics specialist Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia over the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the right time to allow the country to compete again.
The Russian representative of the Athletics Federation Dmitry Shlyakhtin said at the congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which took place on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized &quot;to all athletes who had their gold and silver medals stolen during the competition.&quot;
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) released a report on evidence found of government-funded doping.
“It seemed to me that today&#39;s response, today&#39;s report, was very sincere,” Coe, President of the International Association of Athletics Federations, told reporters.
&quot;The whole council and the whole congress liked ... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it was going through extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation.&quot;
Coe said he also &quot;liked&quot; that Russia agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, according to which now is not the time to restore Russia in rights,” Coe said.
“Over the next few months, we must do everything to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the tainted system, ”he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the World Athletics Championships, which begins Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements still have to be fulfilled in order to restore Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a talk given to the board of the International Association of Athletics Federations, drug testing is still underutilized and suspended coaches are still doing their jobs quietly.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason
The journalist Vasily Muravitsky, detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), was sent under arrest for two months, the SBU reports.
An employee of the Zhitomir Journal online edition is suspected of high treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and of encroaching on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a &quot;barbaric policy&quot; against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship &quot;Comandante Borsini&quot; entered the territorial waters of Libya, then, together with the Navy of this country, to stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to start the operation was made by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed it with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country&#39;s territory.
Opposing the cabinet and based in Tobruk, the Libyan parliament has accused Italy of violating Libya&#39;s sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, gave his subordinates the order to oppose the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they said they did not believe these threats and intended to send another warship to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the Libyan cabinet recognized by Europe, Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities went on to establish a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after the statistics on the number of illegal immigrants who came to the country from Libya was released in July: 95 thousand people since the beginning of the year.
The government said that the resources for receiving migrants have been exhausted.

Two leaders of the Ukrainian national athletics team were suspended from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povkh, who specialize in sprinting, have been excluded from the Ukrainian national team for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This was reported on the website of the Country Athletics Federation (FLAU).
This decision was made by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) in relation to athletes.
Coach Zemlyak Serhiy Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects the athletes of doping.

The World Athletics Championships in London will take place from 4 to 13 August.
How football&#39;s financial rules will affect Neymar&#39;s move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent Neymar&#39;s world-record transfer from Barcelona to France&#39;s Paris Saint-Germain.
Consequences of any kind could come down the chain for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing European football, which has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
From the financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011, PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar&#39;s transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($ 262 million) just to release the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar&#39;s move to France.
PSG can definitely shell out to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team&#39;s funding from the energetic ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums of money to acquire players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his 2007 election as UEFA President.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that went into huge debt in their pursuit of success were, in essence, cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners cut off funding.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on club debt and instead switched to tracking club losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with good potential and then invest heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - has become an elusive plan.
During the current three-year valuation period, spanning 2018, clubs could suffer losses of € 30 million.
And while Platini was dismissed in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Aleksandr Čeferin, is still determined to contain excessive spending.
“Of course FFP is alive and we will tighten the rules as we move forward,” Andrea Traverso, who controls FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay the ransom of Neymar&#39;s contract at a time, he can distribute this amount for reporting throughout the entire term of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual accounts as costs of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG as well as Abu Dhabi&#39;s Manchester City faced severe sanctions.
PSG was fined 60 million euros (at that rate it is 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and it was ordered to limit their squad in the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is monitoring clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspectors by inflating their income at the expense of companies tied to the club&#39;s owners.
Although the Qatari company could have sponsored PSG, if the funding was deemed to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of PSG funding from the Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar&#39;s earnings at PSG could come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more closely monitoring any attempts to circumvent the rules.
According to those familiar with the situation on Thursday, UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG regarding the transfer of Neymar.
They spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss PSG&#39;s position.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG generated more than 10 million euros in profit in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar&#39;s arrival to be fertile ground for sponsorship deals, merchandise and team logo shirts.
The club expects turnover to grow by at least 30 percent as a result of the hiring of a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best footballers was leaving, the Spanish league tried to thwart Neymar&#39;s transfer, claiming PSG would disrupt financial fair play.
&quot;This is an obvious case of &#39;financial doping&#39;, with the club and the state,&quot; La Liga President Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar as the ultimate owner of PSG.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports tycoon, shares La Liga&#39;s concerns about state funding for the club.
“These are all equity ramifications and have completely changed the football landscape over the past fifteen years,” Wenger said Thursday.
“When a club belongs to a country, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to comply with financial fair play because a country can have many paths and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and place of taking the oath will be determined by the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the president - such amendments for the second reading to the relevant law were developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Construction.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the procedure for taking the oath in law.
Children under 18, as well as those incapacitated, will be exempted from taking a solemn oath, according to the revised text of amendments to the bill &quot;On Russian Citizenship&quot; (available to Izvestia), which the committee will consider on July 11 before the second reading at its meeting.
On June 6, President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of introducing an oath when entering Russian citizenship instead of the formal signing of documents during a meeting with State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies formalized this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of a bill providing for the cancellation of the decision to grant citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls for terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet ( Part 2 of Art. 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for hijacking an airplane, train or water transport, but only if this act is related to terrorism (Part 4 of Art. 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, its logic was as follows: when drawing up documents for citizenship, a person subscribes to a promise to abide by Russian law - having embarked on the path of extremism, he breaks this promise.
The bill was submitted to the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasiliev (United Russia), Gennady Zyuganov (Communist Party of the Russian Federation), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (Fair Russia) and State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the State Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been revised again.
Now it says that the procedure for taking the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law &quot;On citizenship of the Russian Federation&quot;, indicating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn atmosphere in front of the state emblem and flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, from the text of the bill it was not clear where such an event should take place - the list of places where the emblem of the Russian Federation could be placed is regulated by the corresponding federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state power bodies of subjects, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could be registry offices.
Those wishing to obtain Russian citizenship will take the solemn oath after officials check their documents.
But a person will receive a Russian passport only after taking the oath, it follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that they will swear allegiance to Russia from the age of 18, and not from 14.
A rule has been preserved according to which incapacitated or partially incapacitated persons, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or personally sign the text of the oath, will be exempted from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and &quot;other persons&quot;
Also, the updated bill spelled out a special procedure for admitting to Russian citizens residents of Ukraine who are considered native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to officially renounce their Ukrainian citizenship by submitting a corresponding application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
Renunciation of &quot;someone else&#39;s&quot; citizenship, as now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is impossible &quot;for reasons beyond the control of the person.&quot;
A corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including the first vice-speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (Communist Party of the Russian Federation), Natalya Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Airat Farrakhov (all - &quot;United Russia&quot;).
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, simply impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for a decision on their fate regarding the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER), the head of the Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation the day before.
In addition, a clarification appeared in the text that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who renounced their &quot;other&quot; citizenship in writing and handed over their previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but &quot;for reasons beyond his control&quot; did not stop it. be considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are prohibited from holding positions in the municipal service, being hired at facilities and organizations whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country cannot become a State Duma deputy or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should come into force on September 1, 2017, by that time the necessary by-laws should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes niche in Hot American Summer and Fellow Detective
The current iteration of the story is nostalgically reminiscent at the same time of the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; about the grunge era in the 90s (around the time the great masters David Wayne and Michael Shoalter made the sketch comedy &quot;The State&quot; for MTV); and about herself - that is, 2001, before her stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd got down to serious stuff.
As a fact of culture, it is both the rise and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems like an anachronism.
Camp One was surprisingly good, and not only because of its absurd humor (including the original story of a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result is doubled by the main joke: middle-aged actors play sex-preoccupied children who have just come of age; thanks to this, the inability to return to becomes part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where the adults played as adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more haphazard and includes riffs from stalker films from the 90s like The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
In one episode, a character pulls out an Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled rollerblades, and &quot;a bunch of other things from 1991.&quot;
Many of the plot moves are the same.
Good-natured Coop (Showalter), now a writer, still hasn&#39;t gotten the reciprocity from Katy (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still has his virginity.
And then there is the insane and dastardly conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Showalter), who is now incited by George W. Bush (a tried-and-true parody played by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the departures from it.
It’s especially fun to see the forever young Rudd humming a song from Matt Dillon from Loners, whose character, former big man Andy, now looks like an old man.
The franchise could be a success with occasional frenzies like the recursive series &quot;Seven Up&quot; until it gets to what I think would be its logical conclusion: &quot;Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later&quot;, where in the last on stage, the whole company would go to the cinema for the premiere of the movie &quot;Hot American Summer&quot;.
&quot;Comrade Detective&quot; on Amazon refers to a different type of nostalgia: the Cold War memories from &quot;The Americans,&quot; &quot;Explosive Blonde,&quot; or even &quot;Shine,&quot; with its imagery of East-West struggles.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Reese Thomas, this comedy depicts a TV movie: an 80s Romanian police drama about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
Florin Piercik Jr. and Corneliu Ulich play the main roles - who has seen the life of Gregor and the idealist Joseph - and their dialogues in English are voiced by Channing Tatum (aka executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit.
This is a brilliant idea.
But just an idea.
There are some visual jokes (the cops spend their time watching a chess match, the way Americans might watch football).
A team of famous voice-overs - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - allows you to play the game &quot;guess the voice&quot; in an interesting way.
But &quot;Comrade Detective&quot; so clings to the plausibility of a clumsy propaganda drama - there is even a killer in a Ronald Reagan mask - that it often looks like it.
Six long episodes are drawn out, and it’s not very funny, and not often.
If it were made shorter, &quot;Comrade Detective&quot; could better cope with his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph arrive at the American Embassy, two fat people are sitting in the lobby, eating a bunch of hamburgers.
To the imaginary communist viewer, this image tells that Western culture is capable of making gobble out of anything.
The fictional Romanian filmmakers are not so wrong: We do this even with our own recent history, and with theirs too.
The prize fund of the match for the Russian Super Cup on football between Spartak and Lokomotiv will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergei Pryadkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, RT reports.
He also added that by now there are almost no tickets left for the match.
The match &quot;Spartak&quot; - &quot;Lokomotiv&quot; will be held on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As noted by TASS, &quot;Spartak&quot; is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and &quot;Lokomotiv&quot; is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young residents of Ufa ransacked a furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
The other day a 37-year-old Ufa resident, who has a furniture company, turned to the police.
The man reported the theft of expensive tools from the workshop, which caused serious damage to his production.
The thieves&#39; spoils were tools with a total cost of almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, a hammer drill, hydraulics, and a winch.
The guards of order began to search for criminals and soon reached out to residents of the Blagoveshchensky district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the republic, the accomplices entered the territory of the enterprise, broke down the front door and carried out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service they came across.
A theft case has already been initiated against them, and law enforcement officers managed to return only a part of the stolen instruments to the rightful owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev&#39;s words about relations between the Russian Federation and the United States
The US and Russia must be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Department, Heather Nauert, in response to the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev about relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to hope for improving bilateral relations and declared a full-fledged trade war on the Russian Federation.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a &quot;low level&quot;, but noted that it is necessary to look for &quot;areas for interaction.&quot;
&quot;Look at the ceasefire in southwestern Syria that has been observed for almost a month now.&quot;
&quot;And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia,&quot; RIA Novosti quoted the diplomat as saying.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the statement of the Russian prime minister that the sanctions were tantamount to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK was signed by US President Donald Trump last Wednesday.
However, he admitted that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior &quot;grown&quot; roses from amethyst and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has expanded the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They have five new rings and three chokers with velvet ribbons.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line has released two new rings and a pendant made of amethysts, rose quartz and diamonds, made in the technique of glyptic (hand carved stone) and pavage and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie, Victoire de Castellane, was inspired by the roses cultivated on his estate in Granville by fashion designer Christian Dior, and by the Parisian gardens Bagatelle and Pre-Catelane.
Trump found culprit in deteriorating relations with Russia
US President Donald Trump has sharply criticized members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an all-time low and dangerous level.
&quot;You can thank Congress, these same people can&#39;t even give us medicine,&quot; the president wrote on Twitter.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
They, in particular, will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House circulated a statement from the president, in which he indicated that the law would prevent the United States from concluding lucrative deals and would further bring Russia, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian businessman refused to buy Ukrainian subsidiary of Sberbank
An entrepreneur from Belarus Viktor Prokopenya withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with his intention &quot;to concentrate on our other planned investments and projects that we are working on.&quot;
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step will be &quot;the best investment of time&quot;, despite the investment attractiveness of buying a subsidiary of Sberbank.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main contender for the purchase of a division of a Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU rejected an application from the NorvikBank consortium of Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company of Said Gutseriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the country&#39;s President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
Sberbank became one of these financial organizations, in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank.
Novak named the reason for the blackout in Crimea
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation named the reason for the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, made an explanation of the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident in the Krasnodar Territory.
The truck that got into the accident touched the power lines, as a result, the Kuban and Crimean networks connected with them were disconnected.
Power outages in large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The specialists fixed the problems within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that abnormal heat could be the cause of the blackout.
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have silenced rumors of a possible hike.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain sluggish and left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressures on family incomes.
The bank&#39;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer committee members favoring a rate hike this month as weak economic growth dampened support for the hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to 1.7% hikes in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that pressure on household incomes would continue while inflation was still expected to rise by about until 3%.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years will be needed to control Brexit-induced inflation and said borrowing costs are likely to have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
The committee members also voted to scrap some of the huge package of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close the emergency financing plan, under which it provides banks with cheap loans, although it said that it now has to provide another 15 billion pounds under this plan - up to 115 billion pounds.
In the minutes on the decision on rates, the bank said: &quot;According to the main projections of the MPC, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in the near future will remain slow, while the pressure on the real income of families continues to affect consumption.&quot;
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to halt inflation, &quot;some tightening of financial policy&quot; will be required, in a &quot;slightly larger&quot; amount than the markets expect.
At the moment, the markets are predicting the first rally in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases will be &quot;gradual&quot; and &quot;limited.&quot;
The bank&#39;s upward forecasts for this and next year are lower than forecasts made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left its forecast of 1.8% unchanged in 2018.
After the news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $ 1.31 and 0.4% to € 1.11.
The decision not to change the rate came after the recent disappointing growth indicators weakened the increased expectations of the increase; GDP then grew by 0.3% in the second quarter versus 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to a bank representative, growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank&#39;s latest inflation report did little to cheer households hit by high inflation and modest wage increases: the bank said pressures will intensify before declining.
The bank added that fiscal policy &quot;cannot prevent&quot; earnings udo over the next few years, but expects wages to recover &quot;significantly&quot; by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of the growing demand for British goods, driven by the weak pound exchange rate, which is offsetting some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shocking results of a referendum on leaving the European Union that plunged the pound.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully impact prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its final rate decision, there was a fuss about the proposed rate hike as inflation put pressure on already under pressure from households: three experts on the committee asked for a rate hike to 0.5% in July.
Inflation dropped to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in July, although the bank said the drop was expected and will be compensated again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher figure compared to the planned 2% is entirely a consequence of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Koreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, it looks like the mortgage market will once again become even more competitive as lenders demand business opportunities and look forward to a good year end.
The market looks especially favorable for those approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of no commission, as well as with a low rate, is becoming more popular than ever. &quot;
State health service to prescribe controversial HIV drug for 10,000 people
Beginning in September, patients will have access to a &quot;revolutionary&quot; HIV drug following the battle in the High Court over the funding of the drug from the National Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in those at risk by an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by the health service for an initial three-year probationary period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the trial after an appellate court upheld a High Court ruling last year arguing that the NHS has the option to pay for PrEP, despite claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, announced Thursday, has been called &quot;a major innovation&quot; by NHS President Simon Stevens, while the National AIDS Control (NAT) has called it a &quot;turning point.&quot;
Ahead of the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, venereal disease dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, with more dispensaries joining the program in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When you take PrEP before sex, you have enough certain drugs in your body to prevent HIV infection.
These drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Eligible patients include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people, and people whose partners are HIV positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensaries will select eligible study participants, including men, women, transgender people, and people whose partners are not known if their HIV status is being constrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation at the nearest participating venereal dispensary.
The program will cost £ 10m and NHS signed a supply agreement this week following an international procurement tender.
The study is designed in such a way as to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical data on who the target audience of the drug is, on its absorption and use on a large scale.
“This critical innovation should complement and reinforce widespread and increasingly successful HIV prevention efforts.
This marks another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the largest health threats facing humankind.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT (National AIDS Control Agency), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when intelligently targeted at people in need and at risk, provides an opportunity to make a difference in England&#39;s HIV epidemic.
Beginning in September, people at risk of HIV, thanks to this NHS-funded study in England, will have access to a new and exciting tool that the individual can control without discussing it with a partner, resulting in to improve many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news. &quot;
Ian Greene, President of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “The first priority now is to ensure that the trial rolls out quickly across the country so that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that we are provided with the experimental drug PrEP, we are moving towards protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV. ”
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: &quot;We very much welcome the initiation of the PrEP trial, it is very late due to months of delays and delays by the government.&quot;
The data demonstrates how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the trial be rolled out across the country as soon as possible to protect those at risk for HIV and move us one step further towards stopping the spread of HIV in society.
World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution to support the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WKT) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the presidency in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is &quot;a positively recommended form of organizing the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people.&quot;
In addition, the congress emphasized in the resolution the importance of the agreement on the delineation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he &quot;played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole.&quot;
Let us remind you that the contract between Moscow and Kazan, which has been in effect since July 24, 2007, was concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the Russian president with a request to extend the agreement and keep the title of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation that has an agreement with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called &quot;president&quot;.
Difficulties arose in obtaining an international driver&#39;s license in Russia
Traffic police units are experiencing a shortage of international driving licenses (IDPs).
To get such a license, you have to wait in line for several weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go on vacation abroad in their own car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licenses remains controversial.
The IDP was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what is written in the national identity card, since the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in the countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized this way.
However, in reality, everything depends on the specific police officers or the rental office: some require an IDP, and some require national rights.
To be on the safe side, drivers still receive international rights, but it should be borne in mind that in countries that have not ratified the convention (for example, the USA, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or IDPs.
Now there is a problem with the forms in almost all departments of the traffic police, reports &quot;Kommersant&quot;, having conducted a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, in the UGIBDD divisions, coupons are simply not issued, the forms have not been enough for four months.
You can make an appointment on the public services website, but there the line has already stretched out until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to obtain an IDP &quot;for technical reasons&quot; without going into details, in the Samara region they honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation is developing in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, and the following messages are increasingly appearing on social networks:
Irina Burmistrova: &quot;Guess why you can&#39;t get international rights in Moscow?&quot;
That&#39;s right, because all the traffic police departments ran out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: &quot;A question for knowledgeable people!&quot;
You need to get international license very urgently.
In Moscow, all the time it is hammered far ahead, on the spot, coupons are not issued at all (there is a button, but the coupon cannot be given).
It seems that the portal of state services shows that in St. Petersburg there is a fig of free time.
Has anyone tried getting in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for the forms of international driver&#39;s licenses have changed, so new forms are being supplied to the departments of the State Traffic Inspectorate.
The deficit may be associated with this, however, it is not clear what changes are in question, previously this was not reported.
The forms are purchased by the Center for Special Purpose in the Field of Road Safety (CSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivers them to the traffic police departments.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with Goznak: in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand IDP forms were produced, in 2016 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was signed 18 July with LLC &quot;First Printing House&quot; for the production of 70 thousand forms.
There is a version that the CSN simply did not have time to hold the tender on time, which is why there was a shortage.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel independently not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand, and so on.
It is not completely clear what rights are accepted there, therefore people are reinsured, and therefore there was a rush demand for international &quot;crusts&quot;.
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to take an exam to confirm their qualifications.
This proposal was made by the Ministry of Transport.
The new international driver&#39;s license (IDP) is valid from May 31, 2011.
Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko said he did not believe in Russia&#39;s ability to build a bridge to Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said this in an interview with the &quot;Observer&quot; portal.
Not a single self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or nut there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, USA, Japan - in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia regarding Crimea.
“That is, in my deep conviction, there are virtually no prospects for this project,” Petrenko said.
He added that he considers Russia incapable of implementing a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot build normally even smaller-scale facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums have already begun to collapse.
“Therefore, I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that were so short-sighted to join this project,” the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the arch of the automobile arch of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kerch coast, the enlarged assembly of the highway arch of the Crimean Bridge has been completed: its vault is closed at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
&quot;At the same time, the bridge builders prepared a railway arch for installation on the fairway supports,&quot; the information center of the project said.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was going ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and Krasnodar Territory.
In Spain, an official who did not go to work for 10 years was fired
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the head of the Spanish official Carles Recio have?
Permanent absenteeism stretched out for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Resio was still fired.
But not his immediate superior.
What does not happen in the world of bureaucrats.
The townsfolk seem to have long been accustomed to all the pranks of the &quot;servants of the people&quot;.
And, nevertheless, officials all the time manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time the &quot;sensation&quot; came from Spain.
There, an employee of the Valencia archive, Carles Recio, managed not to go to work for ten years.
However, he regularly received a salary.
And the whole solid - 50 thousand euros per year.
And now Mr. Recio&#39;s &quot;wonderful times&quot; are over.
He was fired by decision of the Valencia Legislature.
During the investigation, it turned out that the hard-core truant came to the office every working morning at 07:00 to check into the electronic system.
And then he went home.
Once again, he appeared at the workplace at 16:00, to, again, register in the system that he had left.
And so for 10 years.
It also became known that the truant devoted all his free time to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia are thinking how to punish the immediate superior of Mr. Recio, who could not but know how to &quot;actively work&quot; at his workplace, his subordinate.
Judges are offered to be protected from the chairpersons
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of court presidents and introduce their election.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential assignment.
The HRC has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of the Russian justice system.
The HRC carried out this work on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the president gave after a meeting with council members.
At a meeting with council members on December 8, 2016, they discussed, among other things, individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of imprisonment of citizens (see Kommersant of December 9).
As a result of the HRC&#39;s work, 25 proposals were made, which relate to both the issues of ensuring the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors, and the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin&#39;s human rights defenders is to limit the powers of court chairmen in order to increase the independence of the rest of the judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judicial community, then the chairman of the court, in the opinion of the HRC, should submit him for appointment without having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the chairman of the right to distribute cases for consideration among judges.
Experts admit that this can be done by a specially written computer program.
The HRC also believes that the chairman is not entitled to &quot;predetermine the results of the qualification attestation of a judge, initiate disciplinary proceedings against him, or make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments.&quot;
At the same time, the presidential council considers it necessary to move to &quot;the election of the chairpersons of the courts by the judges themselves&quot; and &quot;empower them for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation.&quot;
Now all the chairpersons of the courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the president on the proposal of the chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HRC proposes to organize appeals and cassations in courts of general jurisdiction in a new way.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC says that &quot;it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts.&quot;
The experts take as a basis the practice of arbitration courts.
Under them there are &quot;judicial districts&quot; that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but due to this, they guarantee greater independence from regional officials who find it difficult to use &quot;telephone law&quot;.
The HRC proposes to reinforce justices of the peace with people&#39;s assessors, so that with their participation some &quot;categories of civil and administrative cases&quot; should be considered.
For example, on the deprivation of parental rights, on reinstatement at work, on the protection of honor and dignity, on the deprivation of a driver&#39;s license, etc.
“These are just our proposals,” Tamara Morshchakova, a member of the HRC, a retired judge of the Constitutional Court, explained to Kommersant.
She also recalled that the President&#39;s instruction referred not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (SC), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
The Armed Forces (among the co-executors are the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office and the Human Rights Ombudsman in the Russian Federation) still have time to carry out the assignment.
The chairman of the Armed Forces, Vyacheslav Lebedev, must report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation before September 1.
Living a tall life: a mezzanine floor and clever design tricks turned this small apartment in Earl&#39;s Court into a spacious home
Joan Lee, a retired banker with a passion for renovating real estate, moved from a spacious home in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the ground floor of a pretty typical Queen Anne style house, and the new design is supported by the fact that Joan did not pack her things and move again.
“I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area,” says Joan.
“I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earl&#39;s Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and bid her the same day. &quot;
Since its first viewing, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete refurbishment.
It was originally a one-bedroom apartment with an intricate layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling heights.
“I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
Those were my requirements, ”she says.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Shed to use the 12.5-foot ceilings and create a home that would not only be a successful project, but would be suitable for Joan. life.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate the two rooms one on top of the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine floor that could stand upright.
Erfan had to be creative to handle the brief.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We needed to arrange the rooms so that they were one above the other, and we didn&#39;t have to bend.
It was necessary not only to build a simple platform, but also to bend the structures so that they were at the correct height and allow the use of the premises from above and below ”.
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-sized rooms one above the other in the allotted space - and much more.
From the mezzanine level, a vintage copper skylight window from Retrouvius overlooks the plush living room below.
Gold-tone mirrored furniture, silver accents and vintage lighting fixtures by Serge Muy set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding entertainment, space and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored protective panel appears to be a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirrored cabinets hold all of Joan&#39;s crockery.
To create the feeling of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can obscure the kitchen when not in use.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a sliding door, like in a garage.
“The art of engineering was involved,” says Erfan of the steel-reinforced wood-fiber panel door.
&quot;It&#39;s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.&quot;
Through clever use of space and storage, Joan received an additional 16 square feet, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, floor space is exactly what you will be selling — that is, what your property is valued at,” says Erfan.
&quot;Roughly speaking, a real estate agent will come in and calculate based on floor area.&quot;
Here they have been able to enlarge the floor area by using quality materials that give the space a touch of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with home,” says Erfan.
“Nobody falls in love with electrical wiring in the walls.
It is important, but it does not touch the strings of our hearts. &quot;
This is evidence that due to good design and increased footage, an apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can choose to stay.
The government approved the creation of a commission for cultural policy
The Russian government approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The corresponding decree is published on the government website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
Also, the commission will develop drafts of a cultural policy strategy, clarify tasks and prepare new programs for its implementation.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation was appointed head of the commission.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2016 approved a plan for the implementation of the state cultural policy strategy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 events and provides for measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and it will also contribute to creating conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in the G20 countries fell to an eight-year low
The rise in consumer prices in the countries of the G20 has dropped to the lowest in the last eight years, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2% - lower values were noted in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat announced a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
Thus, the department recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been achieved - according to this department, the figure is 4%.
Putin warned against illegal logging of the Baikal taiga
During a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal territory, Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against illegal deforestation.
During the event, Minister of Natural Resources Sergei Donskoy noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
It allows deforestation during the suppression of fires, and the government plans to adopt it in the fall.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that during the felling process &quot;everything is not cut down.&quot;
Donskoy noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory agencies.
Media: fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine secretly from the command negotiate with the militias of Donbass
Regular telephone communication has been established on the line of the armed confrontation in the Donbass.
The fighters of the opposing sides constantly communicate with each other on their mobile phones, and headquarters do not know about this communication.
Fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Donbass militias have established communication on cell phones in secret from their high command.
This was reported on August 4 by &quot;Strana.ua&quot; with reference to the participants in the military operation in the Donbass.
According to the newspaper, the unit commanders are well aware of the names of their colleagues from the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by phone.
Communication is not at all everyday: the commanders are trying to reach some &quot;tactical agreements.&quot;
Often, based on the results of such conversations, an armistice is concluded on a certain section of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when one or another officer received birthday greetings from behind the front line, from his formal enemy.
Fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and militias of the DPR and LPR have been sitting in trenches on the contact line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine began a military operation against Donbass.
Foreign Ministry outraged the blocking of statements by the UN Security Council about attacks on the Russian embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives, who are blocking the statements of the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2 for the third time in a month was subjected to mortar shelling by terrorists of the Heyat Tahrir Al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in Russia) and Failak Ar-Rahman groups ...
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in qualifying &quot;Nusra&quot; as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call to oppose this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that &quot;it would seem self-evident that the terrorist attacks of&quot; Nusra &quot;should meet with universal unconditional and strong condemnation, and there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions. &quot;
However, as the diplomatic service emphasized, “for the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately varying the tone of objections, hiding behind arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft press statements by the Security Council condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital. &quot;
Let the reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us remain on the conscience of these delegations.
“The most outrageous thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and acts of terrorism, makes them feel impunity,” the Foreign Ministry said and added that “I would not want these barbarians to have the belief that someone in the Security Council along with them. &quot;
Vladimir Putin advocated limiting the number of unscheduled business inspections
During a meeting on investment projects in the Far East, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the planned ones, and also said about the need to limit the inspection period to ten days.
&quot;Unscheduled inspections are carried out, as a rule, without the appropriate agreement with the prosecutor&#39;s office; only 2-3% are coordinated with the prosecutor&#39;s office, everything else goes on independently,&quot; TASS quotes the president.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from seizing servers and hard drives from enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should receive the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
&quot;This, I hope, will bring a certain positive to the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity, or related to violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship,&quot; the head of state said.
As Kommersant has reported, due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, at the request of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, as a result of which it became clear that in fact, scheduled inspections were replaced by unscheduled ones (the share of those who faced them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016) , prosecutorial (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raids (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as checks on applications of citizens (an increase from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations ( 10.8% to 15.5%).

Brothers fight for over $ 500 million real estate empire
The two brothers fight for one of Victoria&#39;s largest real estate empires, worth over $ 500 million, forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and property developer Colin de Lutis lives in Turak Palace, three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who is suing him in the Supreme Court for a division of property and assets.
Paul has wanted to quit the family business since 2014, but a fierce divorce dispute is pending in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, purchased since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 retail outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family&#39;s listing today includes office buildings, building plots in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mount Buller, and shopping centers in the suburbs.
By agreement with the late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as the &quot;main driving force and dominant personality&quot; of the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company&#39;s assets, while Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, this means that Colin&#39;s property is 316 million, and Paul&#39;s is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
“The section Colin proposed gives him, in my opinion, the best pieces of property,” he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
The first Supreme Court hearings were held last Friday after several failed reconciliation attempts.
The brothers are now arguing over who will control the existing business - from which, according to Paul, Colin excluded him.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some objects.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
&quot;My Italian roots make me consider family a top priority,&quot; he wrote.
Legal costs are snowballing with hundreds of pages of testimonies, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer; both sides brought in some of the best-known lawyers, including QC Allan Myers, and the best solicitors.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; from the late 1950s they ran dairy bars and deli, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was &quot;in the last grade of school and Paul was a boy then (about 10 years old).&quot;
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their possessions to their sons without conflict.
“Luigi often told me that he didn’t want the brothers to deal with the court,” she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luc, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; Colina says Mark made $ 10 million when he went out of business and Luke $ 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were &quot;unhappy with the financial conditions of their branch.&quot;
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to the published biography of Eddie McGuire in 2015, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media on Friday contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded, with a text message saying that since the case was not yet in court, &quot;I really don&#39;t have much to say.&quot;
&quot;I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and bash our family&#39;s name in court,&quot; he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a testimony that he was trying to satisfy his brother&#39;s demands.
&quot;Our dad would not want to see Paul and I argue in court,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;he still hopes to resolve the conflict.&quot;
On Friday, this hope seemed to dissipate.
&quot;Our case will be decided soon by the court,&quot; Colin wrote.
Trump&#39;s new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
In this case, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, in the hope of keeping the chief calm.
Here&#39;s what reporter Josh Dosey reports.
&quot;In a meeting chaired by new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, with the administration on his first day, he outlined the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump that he hopes to solve: poor channels of information to the president.&quot;
Kelly told staff that information must flow through him - on paper or through briefings - because the president will be better at making decisions if he gets the right information.
Kelly&#39;s diagnosis is completely correct, but others have already failed in trying to pacify Trump by tracking down the flow of information to him.
President Trump&#39;s relationship with television took shape decades ago - and now that he&#39;s in the White House, his TV habit is still strong.
&quot;When Trump, as a candidate, resented the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was helpful to show him that he was getting fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded,&quot; Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote at the time in Politico that &quot;according to six former members of the campaign staff, in order to keep Trump&#39;s Twitter habit under control, it was necessary to ensure that there was a constant stream of praise in the information coming to him personally.&quot;
Okay.
But the idea that Trump&#39;s Twittering habit has ever been &quot;under control&quot; is ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the campaign staff know something that we don&#39;t know - for example, that if it weren&#39;t for them, Trump&#39;s tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Trump didn&#39;t post.
If his employees saved him from trouble even a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always been able to keep Trump from adding fuel to the fire.
Part of the problem is that in a White House divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to push their agenda forward by feeding Trump material - reliable or not - that confirms their views.
Politiko - just in time for this story - wrote in May about the propensity of advisers to constantly slip dubious information on the president.
Here&#39;s one example, as described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump employees say Trump can react very harshly to negative press coverage, especially those containing dangerous information leaks, and will not rest until he finds who was behind them.
This happened in late February, when someone slipped the president a printout of an article from GotNews.com, the site of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, in which deputy chief of staff Katie Welch was accused of being &quot;behind a series of leaks&quot; in the White House. ...
It doesn&#39;t matter that Johnson is forever banned from Twitter for violent behavior, that he did not provide specific facts, or that he has launched false accusations and then dropped them in the past.
Trump read the article and started asking employees about Welch. &quot;
Goldmacher adds that then-chief of staff, Raines Priebus, and secretary of the staff, Rob Porter, &quot;were trying to build a system to manage and document the flow of papers Trump receives.&quot;
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his aides continue to fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly&#39;s task very difficult.
Tyumen Prosecutor&#39;s Office Fights HIV Dissident
The prosecutor&#39;s office challenged the ruling of the Kalininsky District Court of Tyumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local resident, whose young daughter died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died due to the fact that the mother is an HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility in connection with the reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecutor&#39;s office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished so as not to create a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was initiated under Part 1 of Art. 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (causing death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection stage 4B.
According to the prosecutor&#39;s office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
&quot;The woman did not receive treatment herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist,&quot; the Tyumen region prosecutor&#39;s office explained.
The criminal case was submitted to the Kalininsky District Court of Tyumen, which on July 25 made a decision to terminate it.
The petition for this was submitted by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that &quot;he forgave his wife, has no complaints against her, she made amends for the harm and apologized.&quot;
The prosecutor&#39;s office did not agree with the decision of the court and filed an appeal, demanding to cancel the decision to dismiss the case and send it for a new trial.
The girl died, and it is impossible to make amends for the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the doctors&#39; recommendations, refused to examine the baby and treat her for a dangerous infection, ”the press service of the prosecutor’s office said.
According to the supervisory authority, she must be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents will follow her example.
As told in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children with HIV do not receive medical care due to the refusal of their parents.
“And this situation has already improved - during the year of the work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat their children for HIV changed their minds - they allowed them to carry out diagnostics, began to take medications,” said Elena Loseva, press secretary of the AIDS Center.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents in a legislative way, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, they hide, and run away from hospitals with their children.
The Dangers of HIV Dissidents
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of Russia&#39;s first study of the so-called movement of HIV dissidents.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medications.
Doctors and activists of AIDS service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and see their spread as a serious threat.
A terrible photo session, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechany railway station in Khmelnytsky.
A cheerful company of drunken young people walked over the bridge over the railroad tracks, where a freight train was standing.
One of the friends had an idea to take a spectacular selfie on the roof of the carriage, the police communications sector in the Khmelnytsky region told FACTS.
The guy began to descend from the bridge onto the train, but due to his imprudence he caught on a power line and immediately received an electric shock.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station dispatcher, who immediately called an ambulance.
Before the arrival of the doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnytsky regional clinical hospital.
The man was diagnosed with 1-2 degree torso burns.
Now doctors assess his condition as stable.
Law enforcement officers remind that recently extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, and moving vehicles have become increasingly popular.
The police urge people to be vigilant and not allow such photo sessions, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists admit the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
Oceans may have existed on ancient Venus.
This was the assumption made by French scientists.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the formation of water on the surface of planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that on Venus at the beginning of its history, oceans were formed, in which there was 10% more water than now on Earth.
Earlier, &quot;Arguments of the week&quot; wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean 4 billion years ago could exist on Mars.
Foreign experts in the course of their research came to the conclusion that the water body was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Shooting in a park in San Francisco injures three people
In San Francisco, as a result of the shooting, three people were injured, the Associated Press reports.
The incident took place in Dolores Park when there were a significant number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them drew his weapon and started shooting at people.
The intruders&#39; appearance could not be seen, since everything was closed except for their eyes.
Another received medical attention and was then released.
The third wounded is a minor, there are no details about his condition.
Located on the hill, Dolores Park is a popular destination for locals and tourists alike.
On July 1, at least 17 people were injured in a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured while trying to leave the premises.
rock band Louna will present a new album in Barnaul
The concert of the rock group Louna will take place in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album &quot;Brave New World&quot;, which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The collective is preparing a concept show, which will become the brightest in the concert history of the group.
&quot;Brave New World&quot; is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is associated with the famous anti-utopian novel by O. Huxley &quot;Brave New World&quot;.
The new songs do not retell the book, but tell about a society that lives according to the law of dystopia, &quot;blindly believing in propaganda and imposed values.&quot;
The listeners helped the group to raise money for the recording of the album: more than 1200 people supported the project on the Planeta.ru website.
Your first album, &quot;Turn it Up!&quot; Louna released in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the disc &quot;Time X&quot;, and in 2013 they recorded the album &quot;We are Louna&quot; (2013).
In the fall of 2015, the Louna group performed with the symphony orchestra at the Crocus City Hall with the Song of the World program.
The group includes Lusine Gevorkyan (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergey Ponkratyev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will take place in the Barnaul club &quot;Pharaon&quot; on October 17 at 19.00.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most popular bands on the Russian rock scene.
The team was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group won several times in different nominations of the &quot;Devil&#39;s Dozen&quot; hit parade.
The gypsies overcame the moat and returned to the &quot;street of millionaires&quot;
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again in conflict with determined Roma who have crossed the ditch dug by the municipal government to reoccupy the field next to their homes.
Gypsies have parked 20 mobile homes in a field bordering the wealthy Solihall Street, jokingly dubbed &quot;Millionaire Street.&quot;
Bringing horses, babies and many mobile homes with them, they returned after being kicked out as recently as May, and were not prevented by a moat dug by the municipal government to prevent their incursions.
This tactful company found a gap in the defenses and squeezed their vehicles through an area that had been left open to make room for a path.
Furious residents attacked Solihull municipality, saying it was &quot;unable to solve this problem.&quot;
An anonymous local resident said: &quot;They came here on Monday evening after being driven out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.&quot;
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act, because they are completely unable to solve this problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were driven away, and now they are back again.
More Roma came last night, and perhaps more today.
“The municipality of Birmingham knows how to fix this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I don’t like the fact that I continue to pay council tax and the municipality cannot even put an end to it. ”
One local resident, who asked to remain anonymous, said: &quot;This is ridiculous, we just saw these gypsies leave the previous time, and here you are, this attack continues.&quot;
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse grazing in the meadow. &quot;
A spokesman for the Solihull Municipality said: “We are aware of an illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and we are cooperating with the Solihull police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them out as soon as possible. &quot;
To help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This allows us to get an idea of the situation, which will be considered by the court when we present our case to them.
Crimea incorporates the Novy Svet champagne factory
The State Unitary Enterprise of the Republic of Crimea &quot;Novy Svet Sparkling Wine Factory&quot; was decided to be incorporated by transforming it into Novy Svet Sparkling Wine Factory OJSC, follows from the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea, Anna Anyukhina.
100% of the company&#39;s shares will remain in the state property of Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint-stock company will be 595.5 million rubles. and will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares with a par value of 100 rubles. each one.
The Ministry of Agriculture of the Crimea stated that if within the next three years funds are not found to modernize the enterprise, there will be a threat of stopping the plant.
Depreciation of fixed assets at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubles. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget.
What remains is not enough to carry out the modernization plan.
&quot;Getting money from the owner is problematic, talking about attracting borrowed funds from large credit institutions is difficult,&quot; said Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Crimea Sergei Petelin in April this year.
The Crimean Parliament included the enterprise in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to carry out its corporatization and put it up for auction.
The source of Interfax in the Crimean authorities estimated the possible cost of selling the enterprise at $ 40 million, the investor&#39;s investment in modernization - another $ 30 million.
&quot;Novy Svet&quot; in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 - up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, Novy Svet intended to produce 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn as a sparkling wine factory in the Novy Svet estate he acquired.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third-graders smashed more than 40 gravestones
Employees of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Nizhny Novgorod Region identified the citizens who destroyed 46 gravestones at the cemetery in the city of Lyskovo.
The malefactors turned out to be students of the third grade.
The first statement that the gravestones were damaged by unknown persons came to the Russian Interior Ministry in the Lyskovsky District on June 27.
In total, 24 people contacted the police on this occasion.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation &quot;Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites.&quot;
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, they turned out to be two schoolchildren, aged 8 and 9 years.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in watching the monuments fall, and this prompted them to commit hooliganism.
Preventive measures were taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone against NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs that own rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue operating unless they comply with the new rules governing their operations.
&quot;If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say if they will be able to continue their activities,&quot; Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily Stampa.
Minniti&#39;s warning came the day after Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, on suspicion that its crew was in fact collaborating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which only worked for a year, declined to comment on the merits of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
&quot;For us, saving human life is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue our activities in the search and rescue zone now,&quot; the organization said in a statement on social networks.
&quot;We will be able to assess all the charges brought forward now, only after we collect all the information and are able to assess the situation.&quot;
Italian authorities have been monitoring Jugend Rettet&#39;s vessel Juventa since October.
Its crew is suspected of taking on board migrants with whole lifeboats, who were sent directly to them by traffickers, and allowing smugglers to leave with boats that they could reuse.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the prosecution materials, the contents of which were published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the instructions of the Italian coastal authorities, which oversee the rescue operations in the area, more out of humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct presupposes, in the main, that vessels of the Juventa type will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, the Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary, but acceptable provided they do not cause any &quot;significant change or hindrance&quot; to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are paying off.
“In recent days, we have begun to see a light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
&quot;In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict&quot;
The Russian authorities have recently noticeably intensified their policy in the Libyan direction, and delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have become frequent visitors to Moscow.
Lev Dengov, the head of the Russian contact group on intra-Libyan settlement under the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma, assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic, told Kommersant what goals Moscow is pursuing in this region and on whom it relies.
Almost nothing is known about the contact group on Libya, which you lead.
For example, the contact group for Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here is a veil of secrecy.
What exactly are you doing, what are your goals?
The contact group was created on the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Duma deputy from Chechnya - Kommersant).
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker Mechanic Chebotarev (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - Kommersant).
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group was created from military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did it happen that you were the one to lead it?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I was approached with an offer to lead the work of the group.
Our activity was not limited to the release of seamen from &quot;Mechanic Chebotarev&quot;.
We managed to establish contacts with representatives of all the main groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - both from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government headed by Faiz Saraj is based. - Kommersant), and Tobruk (the seat of the parliament, which opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya. - &quot;Kommersant&quot;).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Libya&#39;s Deputy Prime Minister - Kommersant), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, and dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to especially emphasize: in Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, we are engaged in a dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
The contact group now includes five people.
Among them there are people with experience of work in law enforcement agencies, including the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to include in the group of specialists in the region, representatives of the Institute of the Near East of the RAS.
No one of our employees is permanently in Libya, there is no need for this yet.
Are there Russian military advisers and instructors in Libya now?
And if so, on which side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this do not correspond to reality.
But your contact group includes former military personnel ...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or such cities closed to us until a certain moment as Misurata (where the militia units that played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and became noticeably more active in subsequent years are based. - Kommersant).
We arrived in Misurata in January this year.
We were frightened, they said that everyone there was completely Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there ourselves, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what is the real role of the Islamists there.
In Misrata, we met with all representatives of the detachments that were engaged in the destruction of IS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from the militants of the Islamic State banned in Russia - Kommersant).
We wanted to see them, get to know these people, check the information that it was they who played a decisive role in the destruction of IS in Libya, and not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And what conclusion did you come to?
Is it not Haftar who defeated the Islamic State in Libya?
It wasn&#39;t he who was doing this.
Haftar was conducting operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And the structures subordinate to the government in Tripoli fought with IS in Sirte.
And, by the way, we invited the people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from April 19 to April 23 this year, the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Guard.
You, as we understand, have been in all Libyan regions and, probably, can imagine the mood of local elites and warlords.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreement and the holding of elections that Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj reached in Paris at the end of July?
Or again, as has happened many times in the past, will the agreements be thwarted, hostilities will resume, and the parties will try to seize power on their own?
For us, a good signal was the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders spoke extremely negatively about each other.
As for the position of Russia ...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe in this.
We faced this situation when we were in Misrata, and on that very day Haftar was boarding the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misrata they did not believe in coincidence.
We were told: &quot;You are probably very brave people who came to us today.&quot;
But our task is precisely to show: we do not support only Haftar, we are conducting a dialogue with all the key participants in the conflict in Libya.
You spoke with Haftar.
Does the fact that he studied twice in the USSR make it easier to understand with Russian partners on a human, emotional level?
And by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
Even if he knows Russian, it is very relative.
But the fact that he studied with us, of course, facilitates the dialogue with him.
And by the way, not only with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who studied either in Russia or else in the Soviet Union.
And now they speak excellent Russian.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent they feel nostalgia for it.
Do you think the imminent lifting of the arms embargo against Libya is likely?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I have already said, we do not take sides in this conflict and would not want to arm some at the expense of others.
We would like everyone to be in approximately equal positions.
As for the arms embargo, the Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to somehow contribute to its lifting.
Now in Libya, the process of drafting a constitution is actively advancing.
We hope that the parties will come to compromise solutions and achieve an internal consensus.
Then elections should take place, which was also discussed at the meeting between Saraj and Haftar.
If the elections take place and a legitimate government is finally elected (and now none of the parties has such a status), then the question of lifting the arms embargo can be raised in the UN Security Council.
Raising this issue is now pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees floating from Libya, feels abandoned to the mercy of fate by its allies from the EU.
Can Moscow help its Italian partners in this situation by using its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the option that Haftar&#39;s troops would establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers who smuggle immigrants to Europe?
This is a very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need the support of Russia, because Moscow is engaged in a dialogue with Haftar, and with Saraj, and with Misurata and with the south of the country.
And in this matter, the tribes in the south of Libya play an important role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Are you talking about southerners blocking the flow of migrants at distant approaches?
That is, relatively speaking, did you turn back the buses in which Nigerian migrants travel?
We are trying to achieve this.
But it’s not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help unite the southerners in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first, we would like to see a consensus on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of the government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia norms in the country.
How radical is he?
Will this not become an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I will express my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he, on the contrary, is an opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself adheres to the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
And he also actively fights terrorists.
Where did he get such a reputation?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where the legislative, executive and judicial powers are located.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other government agencies.
Of course, some countries were interested in us not getting in there.
And we mixed all the cards for them and began to actively communicate with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has entered into a cooperation agreement with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
NOC director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin made a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to the Rosneft company took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I suppose to resell.
And what other economic interests does Russia have in Libya?
There are plans to re-sign the contracts signed under Muammar Gaddafi.
We are talking, in particular, about the previous agreements in the transport sector (construction of railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have something to pay with?
Well, they have oil.
That is, it is, as in the case with Iran, about the &quot;oil for services&quot; scheme?
I don’t know what the scheme will be, I don’t deal directly with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are, in fact, engaged in peacekeeping work there.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans come to an agreement among themselves so that they can establish order in themselves and Libya ceases to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is precisely the main task - to help the Libyan people and squeeze out the terrorists from there.
Do you have information about the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that today there is not a single native of Russia and other countries of the former USSR there.
He said that he had about 50,000 telephone tapes of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya - Kommersant) and that Russian was not spoken there.
And from what states then are these militants?
I would not like to go into these details.
Then we will formulate the question differently.
How many Libyans are among the Islamist militants in Libya?
There are practically no Libyans among them, there are no more than 5%.
The rest are aliens.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks following the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and announced their readiness to come again - to Moscow or Grozny.
And when can such negotiations take place?
It&#39;s hard to say now.
Several more visits are to take place, and then, I hope, there will be clarity about the time and place of the talks.
In the Chekhov Museum, benefactors raised money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
In the Melikhovo Museum-Reserve near Moscow, a nine-year-old boy Sasha Matsola, who has cerebral palsy, cerebral hydrocephalus and complete blindness, will receive a specialized treadmill as a gift on August 5.
A useful present will be given to Sasha by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region, Oksana Kosareva, and the director of the museum, Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the simulator was raised during the charity marathon &quot;Don&#39;t Tired of Doing Good&quot;, which took place in Melikhovo on July 15, Chekhov Memorial Day.
On the eve of the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino, Chekhovsky district: &quot;They can&#39;t see my eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter.&quot;
&quot;I would love to receive a treadmill as a gift so that my legs become strong and I can learn to walk a little bit.&quot;
And now Sasha&#39;s dream has come true!
After the presentation, a &quot;Postscript Concert&quot; will take place in the Museum-Reserve - the famous pianist, Honored Artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform a medley of popular classical pieces.
During the charity marathon in Melikhovo, the choir of the Voznesenskaya Davydova Hermitage, bell ringers from the workshop of Ilya Drozdikhin, students of the Moscow P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Gnessin Academy, artists of the Melikhov Theater &quot;Chekhov&#39;s Studio&quot;.
For visitors, auctions were held, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenirs with the marathon logo were organized.
The Melikhovo Museum-Reserve has come up with an initiative to make Chekhov&#39;s Day of Remembrance on July 15 a single day of charity in all museums in the Moscow region.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk, Zhytomyr region, near the local football stadium, fired several shots at the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, the police communications department of the Zhytomyr region told FACTS.
After that, the man went to a nearby cafe.
In the building, he had a conflict, during which a man used a device for shooting with rubber bullets, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim received the necessary medical assistance, there is no threat to his life.
Police officers and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the shooter had disappeared by this time.
Law enforcers identified him and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
A device for shooting rubber bullets was seized from him and sent for examination.
On this fact, criminal proceedings have been initiated under Art. 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces imprisonment for a term of 3 to 7 years.
We will remind, in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya street on the night of July 28, there was an attack with shooting.
Michelle Carter&#39;s Sentence for Conrad Roy&#39;s Suicide Messages
A Massachusetts resident was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend, Konrad Roy, to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will have to serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and another 5 years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the manslaughter of Konrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy&#39;s father said at a hearing on Thursday: “My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend. &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain at large pending an appeal.
She faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the verdict while standing, hands clasped and eyes downcast.
“By her actions, she killed Konrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
&quot;She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She didn’t accept responsibility, ”she said.
&quot;She showed no remorse.&quot;
But Carter&#39;s lawyer said it was &quot;a tragic incident that she deeply regrets.&quot;
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that in his opinion, her &quot;age, level of maturity or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions.&quot;
The prosecutor read out the statements of Roy&#39;s mother Lynn Roy, which said: “Not a single day has passed when I did not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I cope - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever, &quot;- says it.
Roy&#39;s sister Camdin Roy said she was haunted by the thought that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become an aunt to his children.
&quot;To be deprived of a person who has always been with me since my very birth is a pain that will remain with me until the end of my life,&quot; she said.
This case is likely to become a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that would provide for responsibility for advising a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in his car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case caught the attention of the whole country when it became known that it was pushed to commit suicide by Carter&#39;s message.
“You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don’t know there are many ways,” she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was vacationing with his family.
A few minutes before committing suicide, she wrote: &quot;You have to do this, Konrad&quot; and &quot;You just need to turn on the ignition, and you will be free and happy.&quot;
Judge Moniz said that Carter wanted attention through Roy&#39;s death and forbade her to speak to the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The opinions of lawyers on this matter were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of the murder of her British flatmate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
Knox, 30, published her dissenting opinion in the Los Angeles Times, which stated: &quot;Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not jail.&quot;
Evgeny Bogachev: &quot;I let Langford go like a high-flying bird&quot;
One of the best basketball players in the VTB United League, 33-year-old Keith Langford, has left UNICS.
The departure of the American defender to Izvestia was commented on by UNICS President Yevgeny Bogachev.
Keith made this decision for family reasons, - said Evgeny Bogachev.
He has a small child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him halfway.
Of course, I could have said no and renewed his contract, but he deserved a different attitude.
He played for UNICS for three seasons and showed a high level in every match, gave all his best.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played for the Kazan club for three years, winning the 2015/16 United League silver.
In the 2016/17 season, he received the award for the most productive player of the Euroleague season.
He averaged 21.75 points per game.
This result is the second since 2004, when this award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, is the second player in Euroleague history to receive the award more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese &quot;Shenzhen&quot;, Eurohoops informs.
The American is expected to sign a 2-year contract worth $ 5 million.
Langford will be the second Euroleague star to qualify for the Chinese championship in July.
Earlier, the ex-center of Panathinaikos Yannis Burusis moved to the Chinese CBA.
A tourist burnt in the sun from the Moscow region was evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Adyghe rescuers today by helicopter evacuated from the mountainous region of the republic a tourist near Moscow, who received severe sunburn.
The man was resting in the Fisht shelter, located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.
A 27-year-old tourist had high blood pressure and difficulty breathing.
The preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The head of the tour group turned to the rescuers, who said that the man received burns on the hike.
Audi will have to modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the announcement from Audi, BMW said it would offer software updates to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes there are &quot;smarter ways than driving restrictions,&quot; referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - that have considered banning or restricting the use of diesel vehicles. ...
Daimler said Thursday that it is modifying three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their move a recall.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet carbon footprint regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers to install equipment that neutralizes the exhaust gases of diesel vehicles is also increasing, and it becomes difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s government has also been accused of pandering to powerful automakers and ignoring signs of trouble.
Companies are trying not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which hid the use of so-called &quot;destruction devices&quot;, which during testing could correct the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules, and in normal driving conditions were turned off.
Several Volkswagen executives have been convicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
The former head of the thermodynamics department as part of the Audi engine development team was arrested in Germany last month.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore is not protected from extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission regulations and expanded the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is the source of a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen&#39;s income.
In Astrakhan, a cafe visitor paid with counterfeit money
The police received a message from an employee of a bank branch about the discovery, when recalculating funds received from a catering point, a suspicious note with a face value of 5 thousand rubles.
Research by the Forensic Science Center found it to be fake.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for the Astrakhan region, one of the visitors of the cafe, who bought a shawarma, paid with a banknote.
It should be noted that the cash register was not equipped with a device for determining the authenticity of notes.
Currently, the police are identifying persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a knowingly counterfeit ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by up to 8 years in prison with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs urges residents of the Astrakhan region to be careful when making financial transactions; it is recommended that employees of trade facilities install devices to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a &quot;hellish&quot; planet on which even iron can melt
Having first studied the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were quite surprised by its temperature, which is able to vaporize iron and other metals.
Experts have noticed that water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Telescope has captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this heat causes the water in the planet&#39;s atmosphere to glow in the infrared.
WASP-121b belongs to the so-called &quot;hot Jupiters&quot; - gas giants comparable in size and mass to the largest planet in the solar system, but located dozens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, a year on an exoplanet lasts only 1.3 &quot;Earth&quot; days, and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and Southern France, but now there are fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender grows impaired due to dry weather and disease-carrying insects; this has caused constant headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert at CRIEPPAM, an agricultural research institute in Provence, says: “Lavender in Provence is indeed under threat because in recent years this plant has been experiencing the effects of climate change, with much less rain in the spring and especially in the fall.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
And then there are the little cicadas, leaf-jumping insects that carry micro-bacteria; in very dry weather there are a lot of them. &quot;
There is a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is in great demand in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says: “Instead of very long ears with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or none at all.
Therefore, we have fewer parts containing essential oil. &quot;
Solutions currently being considered include improving water distribution and slowing soil evaporation, as well as spraying plants with a protective clay and water mixture and developing varieties that are more drought tolerant.
Winter Universiade 2019 Ambassador met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
The two-time world ice hockey champion, ambassador of the 2019 Winter Universiade Alexander Semin met with novice hockey players the day before and signed autographs to the fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade 2019 as part of a thematic week dedicated to ice hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could skate on the artificial ice rink.
In addition, relay races, quizzes and games with a drawing of souvenir products of student games, a warm-up from the aerobics federation were organized.
The event was attended by 50 schoolchildren.
Alexander Semin advised the children to practice as much as possible on the sports grounds and emphasized that the most important thing at the initial stage of training is hard work and a great desire to play hockey.
&quot;It&#39;s great that Krasnoyarsk has such a site as the tent of the Winter Universiade 2019, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to the team coaches,&quot; said the champion.
Note that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade 2019 are helping to promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk residents.
The Universiade tent will be open throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Winter Universiade 2019 Directorate reports.
The State Department commented on the words of Medvedev
US State Department spokesman Heather Nauert, commenting on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at a briefing, stated the need to find &quot;areas for interaction&quot; with Russia.
Such areas should be found in order to &quot;improve bilateral interaction,&quot; she said.
Nauert cited the ceasefire agreement on Syria as an example of such a successful cooperation.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
&quot;And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other,&quot; the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert declined to comment on Medvedev&#39;s assertion about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
“If Russia has said this, then, of course, it has the right to speak, but I can’t say anything more on this topic,” said a spokesman for the State Department.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that Washington has declared a full-fledged trade war on Moscow, putting an end to hopes of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that the US sanctions will last for decades.
In addition, the prime minister believes that the American establishment has &quot;outright beaten&quot; Trump.
Bodybuilder who disappeared in the Moscow region was found in someone else&#39;s dacha who lost his memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very piquant circumstances: he left the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days his acquaintances and local residents were looking for him unsuccessfully.
And Shamil was found at someone else&#39;s dacha in Ramenskoye.
The owner found him completely naked in his toilet.
The Dagestani athlete could not explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He could not even remember his name, and his passport disappeared.
The announcements about his disappearance helped to establish the identity.
The doctors who arrived on the call recorded Khanmetov&#39;s partial memory loss and head injury, according to the public Mash.
Probably other surprises await the athlete.
The intruders who kidnapped Shamil have probably already visited his apartment, the keys to which were also stolen from him.
July oil and gas revenues exceeded forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
The actual received oil and gas revenues in July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as the department explains, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the monthly average value of June used for the assessment, as well as due to the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of exports of oil products from the forecasted levels.
&quot;The deviation of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate corresponding to the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019 is forecasted in August 2017 at +40.2 billion rubles,&quot; the Ministry of Finance said.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic foreign exchange market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of purchases of foreign currency will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Ministry of Finance of Russia will involve the Bank of Russia in the execution of transactions for the purchase of foreign currency.
Every business day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions for the purchase of foreign currency at the organized trading of the Moscow Exchange evenly throughout the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury with the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing danger in Mexico.
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodose usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa, involving organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing drug war.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about safety.
They were told that they must change their habits.
The two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the kids with you to an office that had been grenade thrown at in 2009, or leaving them at home.
The security experts wrote three words on a board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no proof is needed, suspicion and inner feelings will suffice.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being supported by the government or cartels, a whole list of scoundrels who make the work of covering chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence gives no respite, and there are more and more journalists among the corpses that are multiplying in the country: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter is their publisher and inspirer, Riodose co-founder Javier Valdes Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violent drug crimes.
His absence is felt very keenly, although his presence is ubiquitous - a large photograph of Valdez showing his middle finger with the words &quot;Justice&quot; hanging on the facade of the Riodos building; Two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smile, his glasses face, or his signature Panama hat.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although the office of a special federal attorney was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two cases have been investigated.
As with most of the thousands of drug and organized crime murders committed each year, journalist killers are rarely brought to justice.
Riodose journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are heartbroken, although the surroundings are now much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, talking about security in meetings is of little use, Ibarra says.
“It’s very foolish to waste time in this workshop,” he says.
&quot;Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone.&quot;
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodose office in the state capital, Culiacan.
He managed to drive only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot at 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means &quot;Twelfth River&quot;.
The shooter drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He is survived by a wife and two grown children.
Rumors usually spread quickly around Culiacan.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited in the US last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in the country as rival factions fight to fill the void.
Let&#39;s not talk about the fact that every day one or more people are killed on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-story mausoleums of drug queens, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let&#39;s forget for a moment that the state of &quot;calm&quot; is simply when one of the cartels takes control of a coastal state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorquez, 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, is crushed by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, which is at war with the sons of Guzmán.
The publication could anger the sons; people who were allegedly gang members bought up all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper was taken over that was writing about the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
It took him so long to get away from danger, his friends and colleagues thought that he would always be.
He was a seasoned reporter at Noroest and in 2003 he founded Ryodose with five colleagues, selling his $ 50 shares.
In Sinaloa, &quot;it was impossible to do journalism without touching on drugs,&quot; Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper developed a reputation for being bold and honest, and sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists loved that they could publish bold stories without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted by the fact that in this publication they could read about things that no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Ryodose received the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Award for reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Prize for his courage to investigate the drug trade in Mexico wherever it takes.
He frankly admitted that he was scared.
“I want to move on,” he said at the CPJ Awards.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is &quot;a way of life,&quot; he said in an interview with Rompevento TV last October.
&quot;You have to accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist - either that, or you are just playing the fool.&quot;
I don&#39;t want to be asked, &quot;What did you do when there were so many deaths around ... why didn&#39;t you say what was happening?&quot;
The Riodos staff miss Valdez, the joker who swore like a loader in the port, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on their routines.
He had to always wear his hat.
He had to go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: was it his love for the once established order ruined him?
His death caused them to question their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
“They don’t like it when you understand their wives, children, their legal business and underground drug airfields.
&quot;These things were over the line,&quot; Bohorkes said.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from things that smell bad.
The problem, says Riodos editor Andres Villarreal, is that &quot;the sense of smell can be tricked ... and then what happened to Javier happens.&quot;
The old rules, he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak government institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Cell phones were suddenly forbidden to bring in cell phones into the room where Riodose employees had gathered for a security training: a few days earlier it had become known that spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was being used in Mexico to spy on journalists and civic activists.
Outside, two police officers take refuge in the shade of a tree from the 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were given the task of the state government to guard the office of &quot;Ryodose&quot;, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois quarter of Culiacan.
Some journalists half-jokingly asked if these police officers were included in the 50 percent of law enforcement officers about whom the governor himself said that they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists traveled to a mountainous area that is de facto under the control of drug gangs.
In the next issue of &quot;Ryodose&quot; he counted on three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of the former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had exposure of government spending concentrated in the governor&#39;s hometown.
And there was a gang kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor&#39;s office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was the favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and authorities.
One of the journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of government for most of the past century.
Recently, high-profile allegations of corruption have been leveled against several PRI governors.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when the son of &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán eluded a military raid.
Just a few months ago, readers would have been looking for Valdez&#39;s column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
&quot;Before, we would have known what happened,&quot; says Villarreal, 46, nicknamed &quot;El Flaco&quot; for his lean physique.
&quot;Today all channels of communication with our sources have been severed.&quot;
Valdez&#39;s office is now being used as a warehouse for posters and stickers to protest the murder of journalists, because employees have become what they never thought to be: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took some of the posters and went the next morning to a demonstration outside the local prosecutor&#39;s office about another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burnt body was found and authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
All over the country, journalists began to speak out louder, organize protests and write &quot;SOS Press&quot; on sidewalks and walls.
Director Bohorquez was in Washington that day, seeking international support for demanding justice in the Valdez case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez&#39;s assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their killings for telling the truth.
She then asked not to be given any more government reporting assignments, fearing that her anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdez has said many times that journalists in Mexico are &quot;surrounded&quot; by organized crime, its complicit in government and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco Journalism, he wrote that it is not just drug gangs that kill reporters; they do so at the behest of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.
The Press Protection Committee Artikulo 19 believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were ordered by police and government officials.
&quot;In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up,&quot; Ramirez says.
Of course, killings terrify people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note was found on her body, allegedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel: &quot;I am here because of my articles.&quot;
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some publications have opted to close, such as El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after its correspondent Miroslava Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hang on, like &quot;El Magnana&quot; from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its boss in 2004.
In 2010, &quot;Diario de Ciudad Juarez&quot; publicly reached out to drug cartels with a front page editorial entitled &quot;What do you want from us?&quot;
Some journalists have left their home states or the country altogether.
This is a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still look out for danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened to the photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work balance daily between risky decisions.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits that he is scared to write about the drug trade.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that&#39;s why I became a journalist,” he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, just as the last issue was ready for print, Ryodose&#39;s publishers were sitting on the sidewalk outside their office drinking beer when suddenly their phones rang at the same time.
A series of skirmishes between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Mazatlan have left behind what has been confirmed to be 19 corpses.
The war continued to flare up, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they uploaded the news to the Ryodose website via their mobile phone.
The next day, the first page had to be redone.
Sirens sounded nearby — another skirmish in the vicinity.
Bohorkes looked to see if the police guarding them were ready for defense.
If they were scared, they didn&#39;t show it in any way.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was on display throughout Sinaloa, the Riodose staff continued his work.
&quot;How can you think of closing down,&quot; Bohorquez said, &quot;if, on the very day Javier was killed, a trainee asked me to send her outside to report?&quot;
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit terrifying.
The researchers said that the first remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhino, discovered by a Canadian miner, were so well preserved that experts called it the &quot;Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs.&quot;
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his scaly skin was reddish brown - and say that he had, in some way, a &quot;dark past.&quot;
In a report published in the journal Contemporary Biology, it was described as &quot;the best-preserved Thyreophorus ever found and one of the finest dinosaur specimens in the world.&quot;
This fossil is a recently found specimen of a nodosaurus that lived in the mid-Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good fortune has stunned researchers who call him &quot;truly wonderful.&quot;
This herbivorous thyreophore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to articles in National Geographic magazine.
It was found by Sean Funk while he was working at Suncor&#39;s Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed to be different from the surrounding breed, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, work was carried out to locate the animal inside a block of earth weighing 2,500 feet (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
“One has to squint a little and you can almost believe he’s asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology, which is showing the creation.
&quot;It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved specimens of dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs.&quot;
Examining its skin, the researchers found that this herbivore, despite being covered in a shell and resembling a walking tank, appears to be in significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators and employed a protective technique known as defensive coloration, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow him to quickly blend in with his surroundings and avoid encountering enemies, experts say, suggesting that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110-million-year-old creature of the Nodosaurus family was highlighted in print in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have already studied the animal and gave it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum laboratory assistant Mark Mitchell, one of the team members who spent more than 7,000 hours excavating it.
The specimen&#39;s remarkable preservation allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the scales and carapace plates on his body.
They discovered protective coloration, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although protective coloration is well-established, the discovery came as a surprise because the Borealopelta dinosaur is much larger than living animals with protective coloration.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred masking confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with protective coloration - for example, deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more affordable prey, which indicates that the Nodosaurus had to fight hard to survive.
“The massive predatory threat to the massive, heavily sheltered dinosaur shows how dangerous the carnivorous dinosaurs of the Cretaceous were,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in dinosaur scales also suggests that its skin must have been reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about its life, including the preserved contents of its digestive tract, in order to find out what it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was carried into the sea, where he sank and lay down on the ocean floor with his back.
Back then, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans likely extended much further inland than they do now.
&quot;This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in its preserved scaly skin, while at the same time it is completely preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original form of the animal,&quot; said Brown.
“As a result, the animal now looks much the same as it did back then in the Early Cretaceous.
You don&#39;t need to use your imagination too much to recreate it, you just have to squint a little and you can almost believe that he is asleep. &quot;
The Cretaceous Period is the era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of these, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of its formidable ancestors may have hunted thyrophores.
These include the Acrocantosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5-meter) monster weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose latest discoveries are published in the journal Contemporary Biology, believe that Borealopelta was carried away to the sea after death and mummified in silt.
The creature was found by Sean Funk while he was working at the Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to museum staff, it is the best-preserved thyrophore in the world, complete with skin and carapace, and is intact, from the muzzle to the thighs.
On average, these creatures reached approximately 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes protruding from the shoulders.
Researchers believe this herbivorous thyreophore tread heavily across what is now Canada until a flooded river swept it out to sea.
But the dinosaur&#39;s underwater burial preserved its shell down to the smallest detail.
The fossils of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover the lumpy carapace plates along the dinosaur&#39;s skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, this degree of preservation is &quot;as rare as winning the lottery.&quot;
The longer I look at it, the more striking it seems.
The fossilized remains of skin still cover the lumpy armor plates dotting the animal&#39;s skull.
His right front leg is extended along the side, with five toes turned upward.
I can count the scales on his sole. &quot;
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia, and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
However, he did this without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his speech on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event marking the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Nazi troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start speaking in this language, he had to speak in English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched upon the topic of Georgia&#39;s cooperation with Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The disgraced politician learned that the Ukrainian migration service had deprived him of his citizenship while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make the transatlantic flight without documents is still unknown.
Earlier, the former governor of the Odessa region, Mikhail Saakashvili, said that his signature on the application form for obtaining Ukrainian citizenship was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The term of the investigation in the case of Weinsicher and Olkhovik extended until January
The term of the preliminary investigation in the case of Evgeny Olkhovik, co-owner of the Renova group of companies, and Boris Vainzikher, head of the T Plus energy holding, has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmanny Court is considering extending the house arrest for the accused.
At the meeting, the representative of the Investigative Committee announced the decision to extend the term of the preliminary investigation for the last time.
&quot;The particular complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as conduct investigative actions on the territory of several constituent entities of the Russian Federation,&quot; the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly paid bribes to the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least one billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Vainzikher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of ZAO Integrated Energy Systems Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the VimpelCom company, gave bribes to top officials of the Komi Republic for setting the most favorable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Weinsikher and Olkhovik were detained, convoyed to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin fled from the investigation and was put on the federal wanted list.
How did one activist know the answer to the question &quot;Whose streets?&quot;
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the core.
Just a day after arriving in New York on a tourist trip, the St. Louis native was sitting on a bed in an Airbnb rented apartment, browsing her Facebook feed on her phone.
She came across the post of someone from high school.
It said, &quot;The police have just killed an eighteen-year-old child, and he is still lying in the middle of the street.&quot;
Noticing that no one else from her feed posted this information, puzzled, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
In her feed, there were many re-posts of the user with the nickname @TheePharoah.
The Greater St. Louis rapper tweeted in real time the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed eighteen-year-old black young man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photograph of Brown&#39;s lifeless body, sprawled in the middle of the street, where it will remain for four hours.
This is wildness, Ferrell thought.
But death was not something new for her and her circle.
She put her phone down and later in the evening returned to tweets about people gathering at Canfield Drive.
There were photographs of a signal tape and people screaming and a man claiming to be Brown&#39;s father holding a poster that said, &quot;A Ferguson cop just killed my unarmed son!&quot;
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, she said, pulled the trigger on his rifle and yelled, &quot;I&#39;ll kill you all ... animals!&quot;
&quot;This is a non-standard situation,&quot; - according to her own recollections, Ferrell said then.
“This is not the kind of murder that we are used to and which we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I got angry and cried. &quot;
She took a return flight and flew home the next day.
After landing at 11pm, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father&#39;s house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next nearly three years is the subject of a new documentary, Whose Streets ?, which will be released on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the perspective of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flowered dress and a matching wreath, they recalled the conversation they had had countless times before that morning, &quot;about the experience of blacks and their plight.&quot;
She recalls saying, “Do you remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We&#39;re going to Ferguson now because a policeman killed an eighteen-year-old boy and it was wrong. &quot;
“I couldn&#39;t help but take it,” Ferrell said later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of ... what happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it and be brought up on it.
She must not only be well versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black experience and situation and what we must do to become free in order to be free.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she herself does not face obvious racism herself, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would be doing her a disservice if I could keep her out of it. &quot;
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop at South Florissant Road, a campground across the street from the police station, while activists awaited reports of the final non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur preparing lunch bags.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to protesters.
Little by little, a new type of activism took shape in Ferrell&#39;s mind.
“My activism has completely changed since August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis, she served as president of the Minority Nursing Students Association and focused on food equity and health inequalities among black communities. ...
“I had no experience as an organizer.
It came by itself. &quot;
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Folaian, one of her co-directors.
Folajan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farraire &quot;just wanted to document&quot; the events.
Ferrell came up with a question: &quot;Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?&quot;
This skepticism was inspired by the many people, often whites, who came to the community to capitalize on its pain and resilience.
As Folajan explained in a recent interview, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson were not getting into the spotlight and wanted to do it differently.”
Folajan had already teamed up with her co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row issues.
His involvement sparked sympathy for the project among Ferrell and six other local residents, with whom the Whose Streets? kept in touch during the years after Brown&#39;s assassination.
“In this documentary, it is not someone who speaks for us or with us, it is we who speak,” Davis said.
&quot;It was the most important for me how these people will be presented, because this is how I myself will be presented.&quot;
And while the project&#39;s goal was not to focus on Ferrell&#39;s experience at all - in an effort to show that the movement “is not about a savior leader, but about how the community is brought together,” as Folajan said - she turned out to be the most open of the participants in the film.
As a result, in &quot;Whose Streets?&quot; unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrell&#39;s life are shown, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
&quot;But I understood that when you do this kind of work and humanize blacks, there must be some level of vulnerability.&quot;
In addition, Ferrell&#39;s story again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Lives Matters movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 - identify themselves as homosexuals.
“Black homosexual women in leadership positions support this whole movement,” Ferrell says. - And all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden. &quot;
Folaian agreed with this statement, noting that &quot;the movement is, in fact, supported by black women and many homosexual black women.&quot;
However, she insists that “this is not a case of affirmative action,” and that Ferrell was not chosen as a central character in the film due to her distinctiveness.
“She was the person who awakened this energy,” she said.
“On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that she came to the fore, because when”
You can feel its energy through the screen. &quot;
In the meantime, Ferguson has long lost movie cameras, but complex racial ties remain between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on probation for another two and a half years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place, which she calls home, simply: &quot;Mess.&quot;
She still holds onto the line she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson three full years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We must win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains. &quot;
Two Salvadoran footballers disqualified for biting US players
El Salvador&#39;s footballers Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received lengthy disqualifications for unsporting behavior.
During the Confederations of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF) quarterfinals, the Salvadorans bit American players.
Defender Henry Romero scored first.
The Salvadoran bit the striker Josie Altidor, and then pinched him on the chest.
Then midfielder Seren, when filing a corner in the penalty area of his area, bit the US defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was suspended for three matches and Seren for six.
The meeting itself ended with the victory of the Americans with a score of 2: 0, reports Goal.com.
The emergence of similarities: the artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning DNA
In the center of the hall in the Friedman Gallery in New York, human faces hang from the ceiling on a wire - white, black and brown, all subtly similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheek strokes and hair scraps sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the scraps from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous WikiLeaks transmission of confidential diplomatic cables.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled &quot;The Emergence of Similarity&quot;.
It is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a transgender woman and famous dissident who was commuted by Barack Obama just three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing the DNA obtained from Manning with a computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of faces that might be in people with such a genome, Dewey-Harborg has created a profound, if difficult to understand, manifesto about not only the plasticity of DNA data - the different ways of interpreting them and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has openly stated that she considers herself a woman since adolescence, was sentenced in 2013 on 20 counts, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Pictures of her in prison were not available, so only one photo of her was known: a grainy black-and-white selfie of Manning in a platinum-tinted wig, clearly uncomfortable, sitting behind the wheel of a car; they began to associate her with this photograph.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg completed her 2012 project, Visions of Strangers, with great success.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, isolating DNA from this debris and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning in jail and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article,” Dewey-Hagborg explained in a preview of the new press exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea was not allowed to be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she would like to receive a portrait created from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her muse in prison became penpals and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which depicted how in the future the president would mitigate Chelsea&#39;s punishment so that she could visit the exhibition in person.
That Obama did decide to release Manning just days after the book was published came as a pleasant surprise after seven difficult years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and powerful about the exhibition opening right now, as Donald Trump declares war on people who disclose classified information in the government and devises new ways to foment the Twitter animosity he is intended to mitigate.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all this in time, she said that &quot;nothing happens by accident.&quot;
In a statement by the artist, written on the gallery wall, Manning&#39;s oversized signature below (with a heart instead of a dot above the &quot;i&quot; in her last name) calls for an end to &quot;automatic separation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture.&quot;
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of penciled C, G, and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist expresses it in a scientifically sophisticated way), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how we are all remarkably similar, at least in our biological structure.
“I hope to explain to people that our genome does not define who we are, how open genetic data is for interpretation, and how subjective it is,” said Dewey-Harborg; her 2007 video work &quot;False Memories&quot; is also on display here.
&quot;DNA data can tell us so many different stories, and 30 of those stories are here.&quot;
The last part of the exhibition, which fits in one room, is the aforementioned novel in comics.
It depicts King Kong-style Manning appearing above the US Correctional Barracks with a loudspeaker in hand.
&quot;If they kill your speech, they will win,&quot; it says.
&quot;So never shut up.&quot;
&quot;This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me,&quot; says the artist greeting us from Philadelphia.
&quot;I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.&quot;
Manning has yet to see the exhibit in person - as it has been visionary in the comics - but when she arrives, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacra gathered like crowds of protesters.
This, too, was done on purpose, like everything at the exhibition up to the height (5 &quot;2, Manning&#39;s height), on which genetic haplogroups were drawn in pencil.
&quot;Before, I would have hung them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people,&quot; Dewey-Harborg says of the portraits.
&quot;I wanted them to be like the grassroots movement that formed around Chelsea, the movement that was behind her liberation as well.&quot;
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University Fellow Wanted by Police on Murder Charges
A nationwide raid is underway on a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects in a luxury suite in Chicago with a man stabbed to death in a luxury suite in Chicago, police said.
Detention warrants were issued Monday for premeditated murder, without bail, for Windham Latham, 42, and Andrew Warren, 54, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo, according to Cook County court records.
Twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after receiving multiple stab wounds, according to documents.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
Cornell-Duranlo was pronounced dead at the scene of the crime, officials said, and detectives are now investigating the death from stab wounds, believing it to be murder, while police are busy looking for two suspects.
Latham has held the position of Adjunct Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kubbaj, the university&#39;s vice president of communications, said in an e-mail statement that Latham is on administrative leave and that he is not allowed to enter Northwestern University campuses.
“Now this is a criminal case, which is being investigated by authorized persons, and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation,” Kabbaj said.
Warren is a Senior Financial Officer at the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in a statement via e-mail: &quot;We have been in contact with UK police and stand ready to provide any necessary assistance to US investigative agencies.&quot;
The statement also said that Warren&#39;s colleagues are shocked and want him to give up.
Chicago Police Department Liaison Officer Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly advises suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have speculations about their whereabouts, but our efforts to find them are intensifying,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the officers were called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene horrible.
Guglielmi said it is unclear if the July 27 incident itself occurred.
According to him, the data from the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe there was a relationship between Professor Latham and the victim,” Guglielmi said.
The management of the Grand Plaza issued an appeal to the guests, which stated: &quot;At the moment, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident.&quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: &quot;We will fulfill the requirements of the WADA roadmap in the near future&quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), will be fulfilled in the near future.
“A certain stage in fulfilling the requirements has been passed, RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with UKAD (Great Britain&#39;s anti-doping agency).
WADA&#39;s roadmap has been updated accordingly, &quot;Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of WADA&#39;s roadmap to restore Code compliance, which lists conditions for RUSADA&#39;s reopening and was recently posted on the organization&#39;s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
&quot;Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA shortly, &quot;he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian anti-doping structures must publicly acknowledge the results of an investigation commissioned by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which argued that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
Referring to this issue, Mutko said: “We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures were taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what was not. &quot;
Mutko echoed the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged the earlier problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
Nobody is going to accept this report unconditionally, &quot;Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 following a doping scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the organization&#39;s Moscow office in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli said RUSADA is &quot;moving in the right direction&quot; to re-establish its operations.
Fire extinguished in 79-storey tower in Dubai
A large fire that occurred in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch, has been extinguished, Reuters reports.
It is noted that the firefighters managed to cope with all the fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 Moscow time).
Local authorities said no one was injured in the incident.
For the time of extinguishing the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were blocked.
The reasons for the incident are still unknown.
Earlier it was reported that the 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, is on fire in Dubai.
All residents were evacuated on time.
Buzova&#39;s unimaginable outfit shocked fans: pants that do not cover panties
The scandalous host of the reality show &quot;Dom-2&quot; Olga Buzova amazed the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival with dances in shorts.
In front of thousands of fans, the newly-minted singer sang the song &quot;We Will Be Hot&quot; in a duet with Nastya Kudri.
Both girls took the stage in provocative &quot;trousers&quot;, sewn in such a way that the singers&#39; underwear was in plain sight.
On the trousers were the inscriptions Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier it was reported how changes in the appearance of Buzovoy were commented on by a specialist in one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg admits the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was announced on Friday, August 4, by the Radio 4 news service, citing foreign media outlets.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and &quot;destabilization in eastern Ukraine.&quot;
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia is nevertheless possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier Thursday, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the US and Russia were dangerously low and blamed the US Congress for this.
Yekaterinburg Metro is developing a new payment method
In October, travel in the Yekaterinburg metro can be paid with a bank card, said Pavel Vedernikov, general director of I-Set, in an interview with Oblastnaya Gazeta.
Our goal is to introduce by the 2018 FIFA World Cup the same metro fare system as in other large cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
“We want fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metro with their bank cards, without buying tokens and without standing in line,” he said.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the polls didn&#39;t work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees didn&#39;t trust the process.
“He was never consistent or objective,” said Errett, who runs San Francisco-based Madison Reed, a 75-person hair care e-commerce company.
Therefore, she turned to third parties for help.
A new kind of HR startups are emerging that are helping companies figure out how their employees are feeling.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they enable companies to do rapid surveys, reach specific teams and demographics, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass top management and contact directly to the management.
“Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Glint, a Redwood City startup whose analytics software is used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a greater understanding of how her employees think and feel after three years of using Glint.
In addition to express surveys and questionnaires of specific teams, the product offers a heat map of the company and shows in a visual form which departments have the most complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are slowly realizing that they need to control the workplace or they will become another Uber who got involved in a scandal when a former employee posted a blog post describing an aggressive environment in which those who complained were punished ...
For startups like Glint, this desire to be in control is an opportunity for a profitable business.
The financial technology portal Let&#39;s Talk Fees estimates that the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $ 118.7 billion by 2020.
The Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid a decline in Uber&#39;s reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently appeared among the clients.
Like Glint, Convercent enables companies to send custom-made employee opinion surveys, collect confidential real-time responses, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous texting hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if a top manager is involved, complaints go directly to the management.
“The Court of Public Opinion has seized control of the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If a company is found to be mistreating employees or behaving unethically, even if inspectors do not intervene, the company can face costly consequences in the form of customer boycotts, employee churn and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has used Convercent for over a year to ensure employees are up to date with policies and procedures and to offer an easy way to contact their headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look up the phone number or email of the head office, file a formal complaint, and hope to be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and embarrassing experience, said James Vitrano, head of legal at Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that a company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers in offices in other cities or states — such as discrimination, harassment, and unfair pay — can be discovered and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the employee situation,” said Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
&quot;And we protect our shareholders from employee litigation.&quot;
According to Quinland, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the Case Enron.
But it wasn&#39;t until “social media went mainstream,” that companies realized they couldn&#39;t keep their dirty laundry from going viral online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee to use their products.
This is a business model and opportunity that has been endorsed by venture capitalists who have backed both startups.
In February, Convercent received $ 10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company&#39;s total capital to $ 47 million.
Glint received $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company&#39;s total capital to $ 60 million.
This investment is hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture, and venture capital.
A growing body of research demonstrates that today&#39;s employees expect more from their jobs than they once did.
In fiercely competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and exciting projects are just the bare minimum.
Employees want to feel accepted and appreciated, and that they are dedicating their time to the company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work for a company, they feel heard, and the work they’re doing is delivering results, they are more committed to making the company successful,” says Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Satisfaction at the company. LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when their portfolio companies are doing well; Companies do well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, then it should come as no surprise that they find support.
As culture professionals in the workplace argue, it is important to have data on employee engagement.
But the data is useless until the trustees of the company take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can give the impression that change is coming.
And if change doesn&#39;t come quickly enough, or doesn&#39;t come at all, frustration can develop and employees lose interest.
“If you&#39;re going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be prepared to have 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Rath, president of consulting at management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don&#39;t go all the way, the staff will wonder, &#39;Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don&#39;t care, why shouldn&#39;t I care? &quot;
Errett said Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action the same day someone reports a problem via Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees who were dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its people and hopes that in the long term, this knowledge will help it better retain employees in an industry known for high turnover.
“If you don’t try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
New asphalt is being opened in Barnaul on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue
In Barnaul, drastic measures were taken to eliminate the cause of asphalt failures on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue.
It was decided to &quot;open up&quot; the place where holes appeared twice on the recently asphalted roadway (intersection with Molodezhnaya Street).
Let us remind you that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tram tracks occurred due to the fact that the land in the area of the ownerless unexploited network subsided.
According to the deputy chairman of the city committee for road facilities, landscaping, transport and communications Ivan Garmat, a detailed examination will be carried out for a detailed examination and elimination of the prerequisites for collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that the restoration of the formwork of the ownerless communications and their concreting will be required.
This was reported on the official website of the regional capital.
Team Bruins Have to Exercise Longer Due to National Student Athletic Association Canceling Twice Daily Training
The time is approaching eleven in the evening; a crowd of UCLA soccer players pause to chat on one side of the team&#39;s new on-campus training pitches.
Some of them have pulled off their T-shirts, revealing their backs, glistening with sweat after a hectic first day of sports camp.
For many players on the team, these minutes of idleness are a midday break.
Players signed up for summer classes will head back to their dorms after three hours of practice to prepare for their final exams, and return to Wasserman Football Center the next morning for meetings at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said, &quot;These guys are going to have a meat grinder for the next three days.&quot;
The fact that the National Student Athletic Association canceled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the load on the players, actually lengthened their working hours - at least until the end of exams on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three training sessions for the UCLA team was scheduled for 7:15 pm to fit into the already busy schedule of players.
As a side effect of not having two workouts a day, there are more days with one workout, and the Bruins are pushing the start of camp nearly a week from last year and training during summer school for the first time in Mora&#39;s six Westwood seasons.
According to the schedule, they will have 18 training sessions through August 20, before officially preparing for their first game of the season against the University of Texas A&amp;M team in September.
Mora said he supports the change in the rules by the National Student Athletic Association, despite the fact that it has added another item to the busy schedule of players.
“For three or four days, we give them this huge load, this is a serious test,” said Mora.
“And they just overcame it, they work, they are great guys.
I think that when we live to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great. &quot;
When camp is over, the University of California, Los Angeles will make training closed; no easy task, as its fields are in direct line of sight from the adjoining parking lot and from the neighboring Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded by soccer balls that have broken through the protective net outside the goal.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that there could be a problem when rooms are available during the season.
&quot;We&#39;ll have security,&quot; Mora said.
“This is a serious problem, and I am not exaggerating the danger by suggesting that someone can rent a room, sit there and record the workout on video.
If you have a workout video, this is very serious.
But we will have security there and there will be security in parking lot number 8.
We will do our best with what we have.
I will not worry too much about this.
We have a plan. &quot;
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg were discharged from hospitals
All victims of the terrorist attack in the St. Petersburg metro in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported by the press service of the vice-governor Anna Mityanina.
As of the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, TV Center reports.
Let us remind you that an explosion in the St. Petersburg metro took place on April 3 this year.
The bomb was detonated by the suicide bomber Akbarzhon Jalilov.
As a result of the terrorist attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the performer himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall that on the eve of the Rospotrebnadzor recommended the St. Petersburg metro to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport security, in particular, by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook Steps Up Fact Checking Against Fake News
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of hoaxes to independent experts and show their conclusions under the original posts, the world&#39;s largest social network, which is trying to combat so-called fake news, said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company said it is starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible hoaxes, submit them for review, and possibly show the results of fact-checking under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main avenues for spreading so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false messages ahead of the presidential elections in May, and in Germany, ahead of the September elections, announced support for a plan to fine social networks if they did not promptly remove posts that incite hatred.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook announced testing of a new fact-checking algorithm that has been launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition, to see which posts are challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and what they share,” wrote Sarah Sue, Facebook News Feed Manager.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the &quot;linked articles&quot; feature and work on other news feed changes to address the issue of fake news.
Create a Comic Novel: One Castle in English History
In the recent past, tiny Scotney Castle was featured in the music video &quot;Squeeze&quot;, and served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher in the 70s and 80s.
But for 700 years from his cozy spot in the Bule River Valley in Kent, he watched the turbulent history around him, and now he inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with a shock of hair and a penchant for historical documents, into a comic book novel.
“I think it&#39;s so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a person who died 300 years ago,” he says enthusiastically.
&quot;You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand.&quot;
&quot;Castle in England&quot; covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian era and tells the story of the families who lived in Scotney; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabelle Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes&#39; first book to be based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote Dead Man&#39;s Teeth and Other Stories, a compilation of British Library documents; this project unexpectedly touched him to the core.
“I could just be moved by a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites,” he says.
&quot;This is his fingerprint&quot;
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days they lit a fire for lighting.
And after 300 years, in the future, it seems to you that you are there too.
Oh, how I love archives! &quot;
For a man with such a passion for old papers, getting support from the National Trust and the English Arts Council and living in the castle for four months (&quot;Honestly, I stayed a little over there&quot;) seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent whole days exploring the &quot;new&quot; Victorian castle, going through the archives and looking at the estate&#39;s many treasures and antiques - for example, the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles that had lain in the moat for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking with foresters, gardeners and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
Then at night he &quot;drank whiskey and sat down to write.&quot;
The history of Scotney Castle is not well understood because the National Trust only gained full access to it in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, employees were just starting to deal with the archive, which he describes as &quot;what aristocrats have dumped in the attic for centuries.&quot;
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: “You think land disputes are boring,” says Rhodes, “but this birch tree was fought by two families.
It also happens, guys! &quot;
In some of the stories in the collection, the castle becomes the starting point for broader explorations of English history: for example, in The Worker, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
&quot;There is evidence of a riot that took place at the castle in 1380 in a book called The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,&quot; Rhodes says.
“A peasant uprising started in these places, and I thought the riot was a good start.
Maybe they were related? &quot;
Other plots are strongly associated with the history of the castle - for example, &quot;The Priest&quot;, which tells about the Jesuit priest, whom the Darrel family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, about the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by stoning the coffin (this was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Darrels are Rhodes&#39; favorite family of all Scotney&#39;s inhabited: “Gentlemen seem to have been complete crooks, always getting into debt and spending money on what they could not afford.
Over the generations, Darrell men have dealt with their debt problems by marrying rich older women - I think of them as a bunch of nice guys who know how to look after the heirs of great fortunes. &quot;
After graduating from Castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elamänmäki, a place where a sanatorium was at the beginning of the 20th century, and then it was again overgrown with forest.
But Scotney remains a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave,” he says.
&quot;I felt like, damn it, I have to go back to real life again.&quot;
Fifteen largest banks choose &quot;Russia&quot;
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: after Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, B&amp;N Bank and FC Otkrytie, seven more credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the organizations leaving the ARB will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out - all banks that have announced a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks &quot;Russia&quot;, headed by the famous politician Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, recognized by the way, according to the results of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma committee and deputy in terms of the number of prepared bills.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was laid during a discussion in the Federation Council, when new bills were considered at the Interregional Banking Council, in particular, involving a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, President of the ARB, said that, according to the association, this bill is being adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which in this way are trying to limit the possibilities of small and medium banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other complaints, there was also criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justifiably revoke licenses from some banks, to which, however, an objection from the representative of the Central Bank followed: many managers of the fined banks, in particular, Vneshprombank, were the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a banking environment that is very sensitive to relations with the main regulator and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, declaring their disagreement with the ARB&#39;s policy, to begin to prepare for joining the Russia Association, noting that “the effectiveness of the ARB&#39;s work is at a low level, and there is virtually no constructive dialogue within the banking community. &quot;
Investors will be better off
How will it end?
Let&#39;s immediately answer the main question that arises at the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sector or near it: depositors are not in danger, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
The head of Rossiya is Anatoly Aksakov, known for his scrupulousness in everything that concerns the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the leadership of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator go through expert assessments of &quot;regionals&quot;.
In terms of personnel and organization, obviously, no special shocks are foreseen either.
Undoubtedly, ARB finds itself in a difficult financial and managerial situation after it loses such powerful and influential members with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, this oldest - founded in 1991 - organization that defends the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential for continuing to improve banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation in general.
It cannot be said that the association &quot;Russia&quot; with open arms is ready to accept new members on any conditions, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov (&quot;they may want too much&quot;), who on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that &quot;literally the next day, the representatives of the banks that left the ARB asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our association&quot; Russia &quot;&quot;.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Council of the Association, as well as pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Now the negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both parties are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the international banking forum.
There we will decide.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that &quot;he does not hold on to the chair,&quot; called the possible new head of the renewed association &quot;Russia&quot; Georgy Luntovsky, who is leaving the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank in September, having highly characterized his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now resting in Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Rossiya Association, where it is planned to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress of Rossiya.
Entry of cars with gasoline engines to major cities of Russia will not be restricted
Deputy Head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with gasoline engines into major Russian cities will not be limited for now.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that it is necessary to gradually improve the ecological class.
And there the concept is to go straight to zero emissions.
I think that technically we are not ready for this.
The question is, after all, from what year?
This is the same phrase at the level of slogans - let&#39;s ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will we close the whole city?
“I don’t know in 20 years, maybe this will happen,” Prime quotes the minister as saying.
Earlier, the Izvestia newspaper reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study proposals on possible options for state support for electric transport, submitted to the government by the general director of PJSC KamAZ, Sergei Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of cars with internal combustion engines in large cities and in resorts.
Washington changes the rules for obtaining a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump announced that a new US immigration plan would be adopted, which would change the rules for obtaining a green card.
The plan calls for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be discussed in two houses of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so by changing how the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who speak English, have the financial resources to support themselves, and have skills that will benefit our economy, ”Trump said, according to US media.
Sex robots are real, and we should be worried about that.
Before we had time to think that 2017 could not get any worse, a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots was released.
Hmm.
Sex robots are in the spotlight right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, Distinguished Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must take them seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the robots&#39; eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
&quot;People giggle about this, but firms are already shipping them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we&#39;ll see many more,&quot; Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable cousins to robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also &quot;customize&quot; their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robot&#39;s nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a &quot;personality&quot; that would make the Stepford Wife seem very progressive is even more troubling.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to customize qualities in robots that they find attractive, such as shyness.
Then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots, designed by True Companion, which come with a pre-programmed personality - for example, Cold Farrah is shy and Wild Wendy is bold.
&quot;Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits yours perfectly,&quot; says True Companion enthusiastically.
Therefore, she loves what you love, does not love what you do not love, and so on.
Her mood changes during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may be &quot;in the mood&quot;! &quot;
There is a lot of concern about the emergence of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most worrisome are the submissive image of a woman, the rape association that Cold (read: reluctant) Pharah&#39;s possession evokes.
On the site &quot;True Companion&quot; Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator for men only.
&quot;If a woman (sic!) Can have a vibrator, why can&#39;t men have Roxxxy?&quot; - the site says.
But these sex robots aren&#39;t just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with submission as an optional supplement.
Most men will certainly not buy sex robots, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the fringes of consumer culture for now.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not bad or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots emerged precisely when women&#39;s rights around the world were threatened, with a president in the White House who boasts of harassing women.
The scariest part of The Handmaid&#39;s Tale is not the graphic images, twisted bodies and squeezed eyes, but how realistic this vision seems to be.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn&#39;t seem that big right now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical resemblance to real women (with only the proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to feel human by touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is precisely by their &quot;characters&quot; that robots do not look like real women.
They cannot break up with their partners or leave them.
They have no life of their own, no biography - nothing that could indicate independence or something else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
A native of Los Angeles, Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who has been playing for the Ukrainian national team since 2013, will not help our national team in the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on August 31st.
General manager of the &quot;blue-yellow&quot; Andrey Lebedev announced this in an interview with the BeBasket portal.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but, unfortunately, he will not come for family reasons.
We will go to EuroBasket without a naturalized player, because we don&#39;t want to take someone we don&#39;t know.
&quot;This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players,&quot; he said.
Let me remind you: with Jeter&#39;s direct participation, the Ukrainian national team took a record sixth place for itself at EuroBasket 2013 and for the first time got to the World Basketball Championship, where the yellow-blues could not overcome the group stage, and the US native averaged 15 per game. 4 points, made 3 rebounds and gave 5 assists.
Jeter stopped playing for the Ukrainian national team since the departure from the post of the head coach of our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left this post in 2015.
Men&#39;s EuroBasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will play their group stage matches on the Promised Land.
Evgeny Murzin&#39;s charges in Group B will have five fights: with Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men&#39;s team held two test matches, in which they lost to the Dutch and Belarusians.
A great feat of Trump?
Posing as Mita Romney seems reasonable.
In the Trump era, it has become commonplace that the political controversy that polarized the American electorate has micro-shattered some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers were full of columns on how to deal with terrible relatives voting for Trump.
It seems that we are all so stressed that we will burst soon.
There is less talk about Trump&#39;s ability to connect families.
I am writing about this because my cousin, a left-wing poet from Chicago who has long been at knives with Republicans in her family, came to visit me in New York this week.
She reminded me that joining forces against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Under Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including her Republican brother, with whom she has argued about politics for decades, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
At dinner it is undoubtedly good; but I can&#39;t help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed power into the left wing, but the distorting effect of his rule could move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and &quot;normalization,&quot; we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will no longer be amazed by his antics.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump will &quot;normalize&quot; the most right-wing Republicans who, against the backdrop of his standards, will suddenly seem like a model of common sense.
I found myself missing out on the old-fashioned Mitt Romney madness today - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - compared to Trump both the other seems to be very little evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican nominee will just have to be sane to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin drove downtown, we took the kids to the Central Park carousel - the largest carousel on the NYC Department of Parks farm and the best way to spend three dollars in town if you don&#39;t need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the fiberglass pictures on the central drum - grimacing clowns and animals bent over in horror looking at their backs - are extremely ominous, and the ringing music, oddly enough, delights.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: the views from the skyscrapers are getting old, the silhouettes of the buildings are too boring to cause awe, and the reality of the city does not keep up with the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I am still reliving the day I found out that the Swiss Cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (the theme pub &quot;Ye Olde Swiss Cottage&quot; does not count), but a large roundabout in the North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a child of two, a child of eleven and two women in their forties can have a great time.
If I could give the carousel a rating, I would give an A., but fortunately, no one asked me to do so.
And at a department store this week, I was asked to rate my shopping experience on a scale of one to five stars before swiping my card across the terminal.
The coffee shop on the corner of my street is the same, plus the option to accompany the estimate with a tip of 15 percent for ordering at the counter.
As a result, not only the interaction that is neutral in theory slows down, but also it is necessary to introduce personal attitude into a situation that does not presuppose it.
The poor saleswoman in the department store smiled embarrassedly as I wearily rate my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
Pistorius leaves prison for the second time because of a visit to the doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for treatment of cuts on his wrists, which prison officials said he received as a result of a fall in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder following an appeal by prosecutors against the original conviction for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine&#39;s Day in 2013 by shooting her multiple times through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius stated that he mistook his girlfriend for a night thief hiding in his closet.
Prosecutors announced their intention to file another protest, this time against Pretorius&#39; six-year term, which it says is too lenient.
The Attorney General&#39;s Office said it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal will be heard this year.
Praetorius&#39; term could be extended by 15 years if the prosecutor&#39;s office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Not to leave the suspect in the beating of an NTV journalist
The capital&#39;s law enforcement officers chose a preventive measure in the form of a written undertaking not to leave the place for the man who attacked Nikita Razvozzhaev, a journalist of the NTV television channel, during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Irina Volk.
&quot;As part of the investigation of the criminal case opened under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (&quot; Beating &quot;) against a 32-year-old man who hit a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Gorky Central Park of Culture and Leisure in the face, the suspect was not to leave the place and proper behavior &quot;, - said the Wolf.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol was drawn up against the suspect for disobeying the police.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast on the Day of the Airborne Forces, a drunk man approached the reporter and punched him in the face.
As it turned out later, the bully has nothing to do with the Airborne Forces.
According to Razvozzhaev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal camping
According to the BBC TV channel, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, in Sithonia, a group of people was detained, setting up tents in the wrong place, including two citizens of Bulgaria.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told BBC TV that the Bulgarian citizens were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing severe fines on anyone caught parking in an inappropriate area.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Russian Foreign Ministry accused US Vice President of Cold War rhetoric
The statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence were criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
“With regret we have to state that Washington is sliding deeper and deeper into the primitive ideologized clichés of the Cold War times, which are completely divorced from reality,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
This is how the Foreign Ministry reacted to the words of Pence about the &quot;Russian threat&quot; and attempts to forcibly redraw the borders, which he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice &quot;either with the West or with Russia&quot; and the non-obviousness of the thesis about the supposedly uncontested entry of all of South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to tear Kosovo away from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
&quot;We call on our American colleagues to stop defaming Russia and its foreign policy line, which is invariably based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests,&quot; the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Paramedic injured in an accident with an ambulance in the Moscow region
The accident happened in Stupino near Moscow, as a result of a collision of a foreign car with an ambulance, a paramedic was injured.
Today, at about 08:10 Moscow time, a Mitsubishi car collided with an ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow Region.
&quot;As a result of the collision, the ambulance overturned,&quot; the press service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Moscow Region told TASS.
Law enforcement officers are working at the scene of the accident, the circumstances of the incident are being investigated.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw out her newborn son at a construction site, wrapped in a plastic bag.
On the evening of August 3, the Razdelnyansky police department received a message from a local resident that he had found a package with a baby in an unfinished private house.
“Law enforcement officers and doctors went to the scene and promptly delivered the child to a medical facility,” the Odessa headquarters of the National Police said.
The doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of an umbilical cord.
In the course of priority operational and investigative measures, the identity of the woman in labor was established - a 36-year-old local resident.
It was also found that the woman has three more young children.
As noted in the head office, the family had not previously been in the field of view of law enforcement officers and was not registered with special registration.
Currently, the police are establishing the circumstances and reasons that forced the woman to do this, after which a procedural decision will be made.
Now the baby is under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature baby into a garbage chute.
Grigory Leps: &quot;I am eager to fight, although 55 is not 30&quot;
One of the most successful Russian pop artists, Grigory Leps, will celebrate his 55th birthday this Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer talked to the Izvestia columnist.
I remember how your &quot;fifty kopeck piece&quot; was celebrated.
A special tent at the Luzhniki Stadium, Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday man, a powerful fireworks display over the Moskva River.
You were probably wondering then how you would like to spend your next five-year plan.
Did your plans come true?
If we talk about the profession, it was a good period.
I worked a lot, toured the whole country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
I released two good albums.
Of course, now I am not the same as, say, 20 years ago.
The biological clock cannot be fooled.
Singing the way I sang in my 30s is getting harder and harder.
Nevertheless, I am eager to fight, I do not want to stop.
And I with new people, it seems to me, go to a different level.
With them you are recording a new album, the first in three years.
Yes, work is underway on it now.
Actually, we have already recorded everything in my studio and now we will send it for mixing in Los Angeles.
It&#39;s called &quot;Why are you so serious?&quot; based on the song of the same name, which was written jointly with Timati.
It&#39;s not quite ready yet, so we haven&#39;t posted it anywhere yet.
We will do this later, when we shoot a clip for it.
And we will present the album in November - for a series of my anniversary concerts at the Moscow Crocus City Hall.
Cool American drummer Chris Coleman has a hand in your new record.
You, it seems, wanted him to join your touring line-up?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio, recorded his parts.
I offered him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects - Izvestia) suggested.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from € 35 thousand to € 45 thousand per month.
Then I thought that I would find worthy musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found an excellent drummer Max Malyshev.
In general, it&#39;s better to feed your own (smiles).
From time to time I want to find fault with one of them, but not for what.
For example, guitarist Fyodor Dosumov is highly regarded internationally.
Western music magazines write about him, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Vai, after listening to him playing, said that &quot;a new generation of guitarists has come, with a different performing technique.&quot;
Your album is being mixed in Los Angeles, American musicians collaborate with you, but you yourself still can&#39;t come to the USA?
Are you trying to lift this ban?
Now, to be honest, I&#39;m not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers working on this issue.
As a musician, I am really sincerely sorry that I cannot get to America.
I have said more than once that I study there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful it is.
We are not dumber than them, but we do not have such experience, school.
For 70 years our popular music performers have not been at all set the tasks that American musicians have always solved.
They strived for the highest quality sound possible.
And I am trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the UK has refused me entry for ten years.
But I will still apply for a visa to the British Embassy every year so that I will be allowed to go there again and, most importantly, to work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favorably.
And already in August you are planning a concert in Monaco, not a custom, but a poster one, right?
Yes, there is a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo, I have already played there once.
Now we have been invited again, and, as far as I know, all tickets for the concert have already been sold out.
Will you go to the Laima Vaikula Rendezvous, which starts on July 20 in Jurmala?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Laima is a wonderful singer and a great woman who knows how to present herself with beautiful vocals and even a whisper.
After the tour and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you again want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done in a completely different way.
I want to record about 80-90 songs by Vysotsky in about the same presentation as he did himself.
Only voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
Our famous musician Timur Vedernikov will accompany me.
I will try to attract Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum to participate in the album.
I talked about this topic with him, we have a good relationship, but he is a busy man, so let&#39;s see how it goes.
You and Boris Grebenshchikov&#39;s songs gradually introduced into your repertoire.
Maybe later you will record an album of his things?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful person and a great musician.
I crossed paths with him several times and asked: can I sing one or another of his songs?
He replied: &quot;Gregory, I write songs to be performed.&quot;
Please try, sing.
It is probably interesting to record such an album as well.
So far I do not have a similar task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may make such a project.
If you don&#39;t focus entirely on the affairs of your production center.
I suppose, while you have not yet realized its potential, have not signed contracts with all the artists that you are interested in?
There are a number of performers whom I would dream of having under my wing, but they are independent, accomplished people.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Seryozha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree on something with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I hosted in the &quot;Voice&quot;.
We signed a contract with him and are working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be sincerely sorry if he does not reach the heights that he deserves.
I try to find a repertoire for him, shoot videos.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists in my center: I buy songs for them, pay poets, sometimes their tracks end up in the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to its logical conclusion.
As a result, they will receive a recorded album, several clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I will be pleased if one of them will achieve commercial success and pay me the interest that we agreed on in the contract.
But if this does not happen, I am not going to shut off the oxygen to anyone.
Let everyone work, make their way, prove, as I once did.
If tomorrow you are offered to make a tour of Ukraine and are guaranteed entry into the country, will you go?
I am still invited there.
Mostly we are talking about private events.
As for the big tour ...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, by my own conviction I flew to Syria on the very plane that later crashed.
If tomorrow they say that it is necessary to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I will fly.
And I don&#39;t care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that we have such a situation with Ukraine.
Because I think: we are one people and should be together.
I&#39;m sorry that this is unlikely to work, at least in the near future.
And before, I gave 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We met like nowhere else.
Very grateful audience.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik ...
There are a lot of gifted people in Ukraine, and it is truly a pity that now they cannot fully throw out their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should bring people together and entertain.
I would gladly invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example Slava Vakarchuk, and make a joint concert with him.
But I think at the moment this is unlikely ...
Andrey Okhlopkov was transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known to Kommersant, the technical director of the Vostochny cosmodrome, Andrei Okhlopkov, has begun work at the Khrunichev State Space Research and Production Center (GKNPTs).
Previously, he was de facto involved in the construction of the Vostochny cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the leadership of the Center for the Operation of Ground and Space Infrastructure (TSENKI), he was transferred to an enterprise in Moscow Fili, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Okhlopkov will not have a replacement: the post of technical director will most likely be abolished, and the functionality will be scattered among the departments of TsENKI.
The fact that the technical director of Vostochny and the deputy general director of TsENKI for technological development Andrey Okhlopkov went to work at the Khrunichev State Research and Production Center, Kommersant was told by top managers of several enterprises in the space industry, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
&quot;He has been working in his new post for several weeks,&quot; said Kommersant&#39;s interlocutors in the industry.
On Thursday, TsENKI did not manage to get an operative comment, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself was not available for comment.
However, the information of &quot;Kommersant&quot; was officially confirmed by the State Research and Production Space Center.
He made the decision to move to the position of director for production coordination, the company said. - Andrey Okhlopkov fully fulfilled the task assigned to him to ensure the launch minimum for the first launch at the Vostochny cosmodrome.
Mr. Okhlopkov joined TsENKI in 2013, having served in the space forces, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the &quot;northern&quot; cosmodrome, he held the post of first deputy commander with the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Okhlopkov became a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly with his submission, regional merchants received government orders for kickbacks, but did not fulfill their obligations to clean up detachable parts of launch vehicles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Komi Republic.
In 2012, a jury found him not guilty.
The technological development responsibilities assigned to him at TsENKI extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, then head of the Federal Space Agency, said in an interview with Kommersant that the state of affairs on Vostochny &quot;was already critical in October 2013.&quot;
The fact is that a strategic mistake was made in the planning: the completion of construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were scheduled for the same time - the end of 2015.
In order to start up by the end of the year, it was decided to complete the construction six months earlier and the dates were shifted from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, they had to go for a trick: TsENKI specialists began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment at unfinished facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrey Okhlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and the transfer that happened (instead of December 2015, Soyuz flew away only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says a Kommersant source at the cosmodrome: one launch from Vostochny, but they would be engaged in construction. &quot;
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his &quot;space Susanin&quot;, but it was he who almost always asked for information on the progress of construction.
I remember Mr. Okhlopkov for his directness: for example, in an interview with Kommersant, he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy) of the status of the only executor for Vostochny and work directly with subcontractors: &quot;Why should we put all our eggs in one basket of Spetsstroy?&quot;
This idea found support in the government.
Since 2017, TsENKI has taken over the duties of a general contractor in order to complete construction and installation work at the launch and technical complex by the start-ups planned in the fourth quarter.
According to Kommersant&#39;s information, the reason for the transfer of Mr. Okhlopkov to a new place of work was disagreements with the leadership of TsENKI regarding methods of completing the construction of structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as methods of working with subcontractors.
“It was decided that it would be better for everyone,” says one of the top managers involved in the construction of Vostochny.
An employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: &quot;He was one of the best specialists, it will not be easy to find an equivalent replacement for him.&quot;
According to Kommersant&#39;s information, this will not be required: the position of the technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be scattered across the divisions of TsENKI.
Music schools will have a training program for two specialties
In the future, pupils of children&#39;s music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the deputy director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Svyatoslav Golubenko, for this, students can re-read repetitive disciplines, and the issue of paying for the rest of the classes in the second specialty to solve with the help of special grants, RIA Novosti reports.
&quot;The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow you to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education,&quot; Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin&#39;s &quot;Non-Childhood Conversation&quot; with the pupils of the Sirius children&#39;s center, student Maria Andreeva said that she had to pay for recurring subjects in the second specialty at the Central Music School at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she studies violin and piano and has awards in both competitions.
The head of state recognized her question as very urgent and promised to help.
A 17-year-old Russian man who climbed the wall on a skyscraper was detained in Mexico
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian citizen Kirill N. was detained, who climbed up the wall to the roof of a high-rise building, reports El Universal portal.
The incident took place in the capital city of Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unidentified men, climbed over a three-meter fence into the territory of the Nestlé office complex and climbed onto one of its towers on his own.
However, he did not use any special equipment, belay or ropes.
The young man was detained on the roof.
Officials from the Ministry of Public Security lowered him to the ground in a helicopter.
After that, he was sent to the National Institute for Migration.
They find out whether the young man is legally on the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man climbing a high-rise has become popular on the web.
Users called the young man &quot;Spider-Man&quot;.
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help relieve IBD.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests otherwise: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products may help relieve symptoms in those with inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid of the protein, tryptophan, promotes the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the intestines make sure that harmful microbes from food do not enter the body.
Cells that can trigger inflammation are balanced with cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much disturbed towards inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that tolerance-increasing cells appear in mice with a specific bacterium in their intestines.
And this bacteria needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of protein - to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had. &quot;
He theorized that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could promote a more tolerant and less inflammatory bowel environment.
Postdoc Dr.Luisa Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying a variety of tolerance-enhancing immune cells, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, while another group, which belonged to the same lineage, but was kept separately, did not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the gut microbiomes of mice - the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA from the intestinal cells of the mice was sequenced, and six types of bacteria were found, present in mice with immune cells, but absent in mice without them.
Mice raised in a sterile environment, which did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, received L. reuteri, and they developed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers raised L. reuteri in a liquid medium and then transferred small portions of the liquid - without bacteria - to underdeveloped immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells have turned into tolerance-enhancing cells.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan processing known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells also dropped in half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragán explains that humans have the same tolerance-increasing cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri promote cell development in humans as they do in mice, but defects in genes associated with tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
She says: “Perhaps we need to enhance the development of these cells, since inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri have the potential to expand their population. &quot;
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United has hired a “genius” in the person of Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have hired the genius Nemanja Matic, according to Jose Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The £ 40m-bought player from Chelsea started off with a 2-1 win in Dublin in United&#39;s last preseason match before Thursday&#39;s UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid and impressed as a midfielder at the time. how players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira pushed ahead whenever they pleased.
However, since Matic did not take part in Chelsea&#39;s preseason tour of Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game, and only withstood 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, needs some work before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, genius in the way he thinks - he thinks in football,” Mourinho said.
&quot;We&#39;ll help him get ready sooner rather than later.&quot;
Like Matic, fellow new players Viktor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku kicked off at Aviva Stadium as Mourinho began forming his first squad for the start of next season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results, hiring three of the four players he would like to hire first.
“I am grateful to the club for getting three out of four,” he added.
&quot;I will be even more delighted if they get me four out of four, but they have already tried very hard for me.&quot;
Former leaders of Lithuanian Social Democrats persuade them to stay in the ruling coalition
Former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, ex-prime ministers Algirdas Butkevicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former speaker of the parliament from the Social Democrats, Ceslovas Jurshenas, appealed to their party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As Parlamentskaya Gazeta reported, due to friction with partners - the Union of Peasants and Greens - the Social Democratic Party has initiated a discussion on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And so three senior experienced comrades turned to their fellow party members with an open letter, which, in particular, says: &quot;It is understandable that the party comrades are disappointed with the election results, but the coalition with the&quot; peasants &quot;has created for us, albeit not very easy, but still further implementation of the goals of social justice, which on our initiative are envisaged in the government&#39;s program, and to maintain the political dominance of the left center over the right-wing parties. &quot;
According to the former leaders of the party, in the discussion so far &quot;emotion-based expression of opinion without concrete arguments has prevailed.&quot;
The authors of the letter fear that their party&#39;s thoughtless actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Disabled Anton Mamaev was fined
The Moscow City Court commuted the punishment for wheelchair-bound Anton Mamaev from four and a half years in prison to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier, by the decision of the Timiryazevsky court, the convict was released from the pre-trial detention center.
At the same time, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, since he organized a robbery and theft of a motor scooter from a former special forces soldier.
The Moscow City Court, by its decision, reduced the sentence to Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand rubles. fine.
&quot;Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes a corpus delicti, and, accordingly, such a person should be prosecuted,&quot; Ulyana Solopova, press secretary of the Moscow City Court, explained to Kommersant.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamaev, the factual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Art. 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to impose a punishment below the lower limit.
As for the assistant to Mamaev Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would become the basis for changing the category of the severity of the offense and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I am disappointed with the court&#39;s decision.
The only legal solution would be to justify, intends to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrei Orlov did not rule out an appeal against the verdict in the cassation instance of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
&quot;We will use all levers up to the European Court of Human Rights,&quot; he told RIA Novosti.
We will remind, 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in a criminal case last fall.
The disabled person claims that he bought a scooter from friends for 160 thousand rubles, in order to sell it later.
However, the owners of the scooter, including a former special forces soldier, said that the disabled person and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov took away their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in prison, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years in prison with serving a sentence in a general regime colony (according to Part 2 of Art. 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobilized disabled person was placed in a pre-trial detention center, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office, and the presidential ombudsman Tatyana Moskalkova joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from the pre-trial detention center by the decision of the same Timiryazevsky court.
The defense, in turn, appealed against the decision of the first instance in the Moscow City Court.
ONF will prepare a report on ecology to the President
The final &quot;Action Forum&quot; of the All-Russian Popular Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told Izvestia and confirmed by the head of the movement&#39;s executive committee Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, following the results of the forum, the &quot;front-line soldiers&quot; plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of the domestic ecology, as well as propose a strategy for their solution.
Izvestia&#39;s interlocutors in the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain &quot;deep analysis&quot; on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final ONF forum will take place in the fall.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it adjusts to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at key events of the All-Russian People&#39;s Front.
The Front has held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been expressed and will be expressed at these events, we will formulate systemic proposals for solving environmental problems, - the ONF interlocutor told Izvestia.
Olga Timofeeva, co-chair of the Central Headquarters of the movement, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the &quot;front-line soldiers&quot; will report to the head of state on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the ONF &quot;Action Forum&quot; will most likely be combined.
Over the course of the year, we have acquired a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in legislation, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report that we are preparing to the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the &quot;front-line soldiers&quot; will also report on the work on the priority projects of the All-Russia People&#39;s Front, ”Olga Timofeeva told Izvestia.
According to her, the special representative of the head of state for environmental protection, ecology and transport, Sergei Ivanov, will also be invited to the forum.
Previously, he already took part in the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing that needs to be done today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they work for many years.
So that these issues do not fall out of the agenda, - added Olga Timofeeva.
The head of the laboratory for regional policy of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISS) Andrei Kolyadin noted: raising environmental issues, the ONF acts in line with the presidential agenda.
As experts, they proposed many things at various forums, and these initiatives received the president&#39;s support, ”Andrei Kolyadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that today the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be ruled out, which can give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the ONF, the regions will be able to lobby not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the &quot;direct line&quot; with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the landfill in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (a bill has already been developed to ban open transshipment of coal in settlements, one of the authors is Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the question is in further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions made by the state, - said the head of the Ecology for All charitable foundation Leonid Bochin.
Sergei Tsyplenkov, member of the Human Rights Council, head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, in a conversation with Izvestia, stressed that a responsible approach of society and business is necessary for the successful solution of environmental problems, legislative efforts alone are not enough.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in a strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergei Tsyplenkov.
The expert emphasized that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violation of environmental legislation is an economically profitable solution for business.
British inventor implanted a microchip to get into a house and a car with a wave of his hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open the door of his house, enter an office and even start a car with a simple wave of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and now, through his firm, BioTech, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology.
He has teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, a consulting anesthesiologist at the Royal Winchester, to ensure that the implantation procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northham&#39;s company is also replacing locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible locks at a cost of £ 300 per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
Props for the White House cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
According to military records provided to TIME magazine, the White House&#39;s decision last month to bring a Marine Corps helicopter to the South Lawn for an American industrial production event cost taxpayers a whopping $ 24,000.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as &quot;Marine One&quot; when the president is on board, became the centerpiece of a July 17 White House event that showcased US construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials inspected technology products from all fifty states.
The Connecticut-built helicopter was displayed alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the records of the 1st Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the department responsible for helicopter control, the White House War Office ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or &quot;FRAGO,&quot; just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn. on the occasion of the &quot;unusual&quot; event.
“I just wanted you to make sure you are in the know because this is an unusual high-profile event,” the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the Marine Corps First Deputy Chief of Air, ahead of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the 3 p.m. event and will remain there until the lawn is vacated between 6 and 9 p.m. the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the restrictions on opening hours.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, while the unit&#39;s security personnel remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It is unclear from TIME&#39;s logs whether a second crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political gain.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event was in conflict with this ruling.
“Among other things, we asked if this was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were told no,” the commander wrote.
“It looks like you have nowhere to go,” the deputy chief replied.
The Made in America event was declared an official event by the White House and was not subject to Hatch&#39;s law.
But even official events have political overtones.
During the event, the president made efforts to promote health care reform, which was under development in the Senate at the time, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The political use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One is hardly new.
Presidents are instructed to use them for travel.
But asking for them solely in the interests of photographic capability is unusual.
Trump was already a topic of discussion in February, when the presidential plane passed in the background during his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was inundated with messages complaining about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
&quot;The White House is thrilled to see Made in America, which showcased 50-state products made by American workers from American materials,&quot; said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently fly training flights around the Washington metropolitan area and the South Lawn to practice transporting the President of the United States to the White House with an inch of precision.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings outside the White House.
The flight made for the Made in America event was credited to the crew against the required training flights for the month, one official said.
The unit&#39;s helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of &quot;non-presidential support missions.&quot;
According to the White House, taxpayers did not bear the cost of any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in organizing the helicopter demonstration on the South Lawn.
The HMX-1 does not keep track of the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to FY 2017 DOD hourly rates, the DOD reimbursement rate for VH-3D is $ 24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records that the time of the aircraft in the air was 30 minutes in each direction from its airfield at the Quantico Marine Corps Air Base in Virginia.
The White House argues that the real cost of using the helicopter is much lower than this rate.
“Calculating the cost to taxpayers based on the estimated refund rate is completely wrong,” says Walters.
&quot;These indicative rates include personnel, maintenance and many other sunk costs that are included in the annual appropriation.&quot;
According to a 2015 study by RAND Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer spoke out in favor of using the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to showcase things made in America this week,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security and that there are, I guess, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to create.
Therefore, of course, it is perfectly appropriate to pay attention to this ”.
It was unclear if Trump interacted with the helicopter while inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he definitely sat in the driver&#39;s seat in the fire engine.
Inside the White House, Trump reached out to Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of the company&#39;s products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said. &quot;I have three of them.&quot;
Moscow will provide grants for intensive care units of city hospitals
Saving Lives grants will be allocated annually to resuscitation and intensive care units of the capital&#39;s medical clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed a letter of gratitude to the traumatologist-orthopedist Viktor Protsko, under whose leadership a complex operation was performed to reconstruct the teenager&#39;s foot.
Sergei Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to annually allocate grants to intensive care units and intensive care units of city clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is currently one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment that allows its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomna rural hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are designed to receive over a thousand patients.
In addition to intensive care and hospital, there are day departments.
The hospital employs 2,800 people.
The total area occupied by the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in a pilot project for the organization of short-term hospitals (SKP).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which significantly shortens the rehabilitation period for patients.
After surgery, they spend only a few hours in the hospital.
In the first half of this year alone, the Yudin Clinical Hospital provided inpatient medical care to 36 thousand patients.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU announced the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian &quot;subsidiary&quot; of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian subsidiary of Sberbank.
This was reported on Friday, August 4, by TASS with reference to a representative of the NBU press service.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Viktor Prokopenya, for the approval of an indirect (through Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank shares was withdrawn.
&quot;The NBU has not received any documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares,&quot; the message says.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused to Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov to acquire a Ukrainian subsidiary of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification for their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian subsidiary to the consortium Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the subsidiaries of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favor of parent organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, participate, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overemphasized,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Choices can only be fully representative when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
The provincial council and presidential elections will take place in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban threaten to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the shift of international forces from military operations to advisory roles.
In this year&#39;s elections, for the first time, power passes peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Hayesom said that increasing the role of women will contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
Of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women, according to the Afghan Independent Election Commission.

Venice tightens fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities have increased the fines for bathing in the canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
Walking around the city in a swimsuit or with a naked torso will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be demanded from those who have a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle in pedestrian areas, TASS reports with reference to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide for a fine for inscriptions on monuments of 400 euros and 25 euros for rubbish.
Visitors will be informed about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice through the special company &quot;Enjoy, Respect Venice&quot; (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) on social networks, as well as through announcements and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in places of the greatest concentration of tourists ...
The campaign will be run in 10 languages.
According to Venice tourism advisor Paola Mar, information about fines will be transmitted to the embassies of the violators&#39; home countries in order to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
&quot;The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach,&quot; she said.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the flow of tourists.
Venice is already successfully limiting the number of tourists visiting the city center.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to watch the Festa del Redentore, only 60,000 were allowed to the scene.
In addition, a moratorium has been introduced on the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.

In addition, the program includes open discussions, interactive zones and art objects, united by the idea of fusing music and science.

Federation Council dismissed Ozerov from the post of head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the Chairman of the Defense and Security Committee Viktor Ozerov and dismissed him from this post.
He remains a senator from the Khabarovsk Territory.
Ozerov wrote a statement asking to be relieved of his post last week.
He explained his decision by the need for rotation and his desire to &quot;change the rhythm of life.&quot;
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not momentary.
Since 1996, Viktor Ozerov has represented the legislative assembly of the Khabarovsk Territory in the Federation Council of the Russian Federation.
The Senator has been in charge of the Defense and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is getting cheaper both for residents and producers of Buryatia
The decades-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
Effective September 1, the cost of low voltage electricity for industrial consumers is reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation &quot;On Amendments to the Rules of the Wholesale Electricity and Capacity Market and the Consolidated Forecast Balance of Production and Supply of Electricity (Capacity) within the Unified Energy System of Russia for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation&quot; (dated 17.07. 2017 No. 842) established indicative prices for electricity and capacity for industrial consumers in the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat commodity producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the life of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have beaten the doorsteps of Moscow offices in vain attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk Oblast with a cascade of hydroelectric power plants on the Angara River, flowing from Lake Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryatia.
And only this year, progress began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles / kWh to 3.93 rubles / kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the List of territories of price zones of the wholesale market, for which the specifics of the functioning of the wholesale and retail markets are established, it is the turn of industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of the Irkutsk region pays 1.01 rubles per kilowatt / hour.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date for new downward tariff shifts for Buryatia.
Scooter was not afraid of the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office of Ukraine and flew to Crimea
The legend of electronic dance music, the Scooter group flew to Crimea, not afraid of threats from the General Prosecutor&#39;s Office of Ukraine.
&quot;The flight went well, and tomorrow I will have a concert,&quot; RIA Novosti quoted the frontman of the HP Baxter group as saying.
Earlier, the German edition Bild, citing the Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yevgeny Yenin, reported that for coming to Crimea, which Kiev considers to be the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, the musicians could face up to eight years in prison.
Scooter&#39;s performance at the #ZBFest festival in Balaklava is scheduled for August 4th.
#ZBFest is held by the &quot;Zolotaya Balka&quot; company in honor of the International Champagne Day.
Scooter, one of the most famous bands in Germany, was founded in 1993.
Ace&#39;s last album was released in 2016.
Besides Scooter, guests of the festival will be Sergey Galanin and his group &quot;SerGa&quot;, as well as Garik Sukachev with &quot;Brigade S&quot;.
The premiere of the new season of Game of Thrones will take place in the Moscow metro
The Russian premiere of the seventh season of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; will take place in the Moscow metro.
The site of &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; writes about it.
It is known that the first episode will be shown on the night of July 18 at one of the stations as part of the &quot;Night on the Metro&quot; campaign.

National Union of Unskilled Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) worries about capital investment at McVitie&#39;s Glasgow factory
The union is demanding guarantees from the managers of the biscuit maker McVitie&#39;s in connection with its long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland says the company has passed over the issue of future investments at the Tolkross site in silence.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products, employs over 500 people.
Pladis, owner of McVitie&#39;s, says it has invested over £ 5 million in the property over the past few years.
The company adds that in the event of any changes to the site, employees and union representatives &quot;will be the first to know.&quot;
In a letter to the head of the company&#39;s facility, GMB Scotland demanded that McVitie&#39;s respond to concerns that funding would not be used to upgrade production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said, &quot;Our union members are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the general manager of the site on the business needs and investment plan for Tolcross&#39;s future.&quot;
Families have worked here for generations and the concentration of workers is high in the local community and in the Greater Glasgow area; it is the most important pillar of decent work in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and amid Brexit, rising living wages and chronic declines in production, East End Glasgow desperately needs McVitie&#39;s to thrive.
According to a Pladis spokeswoman, &quot;The Tolkross site manager received a letter from GMB Scottish just yesterday and the company will respond immediately as we value our ongoing collaboration with staff and union representatives.&quot;
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB employees and representatives in Tolcross, at which we openly discussed a number of issues.
We talked with employees that, like all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions - and this applies to all our facilities and areas of activity - in order to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested over £ 5 million in our Tolkross facility, especially in production lines and performance improvements.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a manufacturing facility and should any change occur at the facility, employees and union representatives will be the first to know. ”
Putin said the authorities will not issue instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers should get involved in the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNHK), but no one would give instructions to Gazprom or Rosneft.
This is how Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin&#39;s request for assistance in resolving the conflicts that had arisen.
The head of state drew attention to the fact that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of large investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNHK jeopardizes the project&#39;s deadline.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
Gazprom offers to find gas resources from the Rosneft perimeter, but we do not have such resources, &quot;Sechin added.
Let us remind you that Rosneft asked to be allowed to use gas from Gazprom&#39;s Kirinskoye field located on the Sakhalin shelf for the Eastern Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on the issue were ongoing and &quot;there are no sharp corners there.&quot;
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar&#39;s transfer three years ago?
A La Liga member may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop pursuing Neymar after the club offered £ 189m for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about a world record-breaking raid three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window as the Ligue 1 club was poised to break the world record for transfer costs, more than double the previous mark associated with Paul Pogba&#39;s return to Manchester United last season for £ 89m.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will be the most valuable player in the world, as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of over £ 500,000 a week net.
Barcelona are known to be furious at how the offer was made and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the Catalan club insists, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transfer from Santos in 2013.
But wasn&#39;t the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any club that wanted to lure one of PSG&#39;s best players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will oppose them, we will make offers to their players,” Al-Helaifi said.
“We treat all clubs with respect.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will face consequences. &quot;
Barcelona seem to have crossed that line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed an interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
PSG have made it clear that they will not let the Italian player go under any conditions, and now, probably, Barcelona are feeling the consequences of their proposal in the form of the loss of one of their most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin instructed to deal with payments to victims of forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed to sort out the material assistance that is allocated to residents affected by forest fires and for the construction of new housing.
Today I would like to hear how the work is progressing.
Including, I ask you to report on how things are with payments and compensations to the affected citizens.
I have some discrepancy.
&quot;In this regard, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues questions about how much money has been allocated,&quot; Putin said at a meeting with the heads of the regions located on Lake Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Nature Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the plenipotentiary of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District Sergey Menyailo and the head of the Baikal branch of the Federal State Budgetary Institution &quot;Glavrybvod&quot; Leonid Mikhailik.
They talked about the work on cleaning the lake.
Then the fry were shown in an open container next to the container, which were prepared for breeding.
First, Putin released some fry from the net.
Then he pulled on the special lever on the lid of the container and released the others.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to deal with the ecological situation on Lake Baikal and build a road on Olkhon Island.
According to the Ministry of Construction, one volume is needed, but supposedly another volume is provided.
“I want to sort it out, what, in fact, is happening there with funding,” the Russian leader emphasized.
Recall that during the forest fires in 2017, the settlements of Buryatia, the Irkutsk region were engulfed in fire, residential buildings and outbuildings were destroyed.
In Ukraine, they offered to send Russians to prison for illegal border crossing
The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine has registered a draft law according to which a criminal punishment may appear in the republic for Russians for illegally crossing the Ukrainian border.
According to the RT TV channel, the document registered in the electronic database of the Ukrainian parliament provides for a three-year imprisonment for Russian citizens trying to illegally enter the country.
It is noted that for a repeated offense or act committed by a group of persons, the term of imprisonment can be increased to five years.
If the violator was detained at the border with weapons, then the time of detention for him will increase to eight years.
Earlier it was reported that Ukrainian border guards detained Ukrainians who were trying to get to Russia outside the established checkpoints.
&quot;Magnet&quot; went into wholesale
The second largest food retailer in terms of revenue, Magnit, announced the opening of three test stores of a new format, Magnit-Opt, which are designed to purchase products in small wholesale.
At the same time, the possibility of purchasing goods at retail remains, the company&#39;s press release says.
New format stores were opened in Krasnodar, Saratov and Ulyanovsk.
Their assortment includes about 1.5 thousand items of food and non-food products.
&quot;The new service will allow companies and entrepreneurs to make purchases with financial benefits, and residents - to purchase food in reserve: for a week or a month,&quot; - we are confident in Magnet.
Metro Cash &amp; Carry and Selgros Cash &amp; Carry are already operating in the small wholesale segment.
In 2017, Lenta launched a special Lenta Pro program: it offered legal entities and private entrepreneurs to make purchases at special checkout counters in hypermarkets, receive invoices for cost accounting and VAT refunds.
The project is focused on the HoReCa segment, small retail and offices.
Two new territories of advanced socio-economic development will appear in Russia - &quot;Abaza&quot; and &quot;Novotroitsk&quot;.
The corresponding decrees of the Government of the Russian Federation will enter into force today, August 4.
The boundaries and types of economic activities of the TOP on the territory of the city of Abaza in the Republic of Khakassia have been determined.
The city, where 15 thousand people live, will have a special legal regime for entrepreneurial activity, as well as a minimum amount of capital investments of residents, a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
It is assumed that this will attract about 2.5 billion rubles of investments to the city, and more than 600 new jobs will be created.
The list of types of economic activities in which a special legal regime of entrepreneurial activity will operate in the Abaza ASEZ, for example, includes crop production, animal husbandry, food production, soft drinks and clothing.
The Government of the republic has already signed framework agreements on the implementation of 8 investment projects.
It is also planned to reduce the dependence of the territory on the city-forming enterprise Abakansky Rudnik LLC.
In January 2017, the regional authorities reported that Khakassia had fulfilled all the conditions of the Ministry of Economic Development for the creation of the ASEZ.
The authorities of the Orenburg region did the same.
There, in the city of Novotroitsk, a territory of advanced social and economic development will also be created.
This will diversify the economy of the monotown, reduce its dependence on the city-forming enterprise JSC Ural Steel, as well as create more than 2.3 thousand jobs and attract investments in the amount of more than 8 billion rubles.
The list of economic activities under which a special legal regime for entrepreneurs will operate in the new ASEZ includes, in particular, freshwater fish farming, the production of feed, medicines and medical materials.
Novotroitsk became the first of the monotowns of the Orenburg region to receive the TOP status.
Let us recall that the territory of advanced development is an economic zone with preferential tax conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges, which is created to attract investments and improve the life of the population.
Among the benefits for residents of the TOP, the following can be distinguished: income tax in the amount of no more than 5% for the first five years, and at least 10% over the next 5 years, social contributions in the amount of 7.6% for 10 years, use the regime of a free customs zone, a preferential regime for connecting to various infrastructure facilities, as well as preferential rental rates.
Vine called Manson &quot;rabble&quot; and threatened to &quot;kick in the face&quot;
Yuri Loza expressed his indignation at the statement of the American rock musician Marilyn Manson, who insulted Moscow.
In an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Russian singer called Manson a &quot;scoundrel&quot; and &quot;rabble.&quot;
According to Loza, foreign artists who make such statements do not need to be invited to Russia.
In addition, Lohse believes that Manson needs to be &quot;kicked in the face&quot; for his words.
We will remind, the American artist, known for his shocking deeds, spoke rudely about the Russian capital at a concert in Kiev.
Earlier on Thursday, &quot;Arguments of the Week&quot; wrote that Manson&#39;s statement was commented on by domestic producer Joseph Prigozhin.
In Moscow, a policeman wounded a man in the leg, defending himself from an attack
A policeman shot a participant in a fight in Moscow in the leg after he attacked him with a piece of glass in his hand.
On August 3, in the evening, the police department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Yakimanka district received a message about a fight on 46 Mytnaya Street.
&quot;The arriving police squad stopped the offense and separated the parties to the conflict,&quot; RIA Novosti reported, citing the press service of the Moscow Interior Ministry&#39;s headquarters.
According to the police, when one of the participants in the conflict attacked an employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs with a piece of glass, the policeman warned the man several times about the use of weapons and fired a warning shot.
This did not stop the bully, after which a law enforcement officer shot the man in the leg.
The wounded man required hospitalization.
