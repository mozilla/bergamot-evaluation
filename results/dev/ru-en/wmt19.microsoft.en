Number of recruits from Ukraine are named for sending to Donbass
The official representative of the People's Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LNR) Andrei Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass.
According to him, in this way Kiev plans to "somehow complement the units."
"The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass layoffs led to low staffing of units," Marochko said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real figures of Ukrainians drafted into the army can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Forces Operation (JOC).
This measure was supposed to strengthen the role of Ukrainian security forces in the settlement of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass escalated due to the murder of the head of the DNR, Aleksandr Sakharchenko.
The DNR authorities described the incident as a terrorist attack.
Several people involved in the explosion were detained during the investigation of the criminal case.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by Ukrainian special services.

British Foreign Secretary compares EU to Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the EU to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing the member states of the community.
The diplomat made such a statement at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt has commented on the difficulties in negotiating Brexit.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not decrease, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity," the minister said.
He added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the European Union will only exacerbate the crisis, Gazeta.ru notes.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that the Brexit negotiations had stalled.
So she commented on the results of the informal summit of the European Union in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was made in 2016 following the referendum.

In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact once London leaves the community.
In addition, the question of the Irish border remains open.

iPhone users complained about problems with the Telegram messenger after the update, which was released on September 28.
The user's phone number can be found by its lake
Complaints relate to gadgets with current operating system iOS 12.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their fraud dispute.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the TV channel, as part of the agreements reached, Musk will have to leave the post of head of Tesla's board of directors.
At the same time, the commission allowed Musk to retain the post of Tesla CEO.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.

He is the head of SpaceX Space Corporation, neurotechology company Neuralink and tesla electric car developer, and co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has previously sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his tweet message about a possible buyout.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy back all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The value of the stock of $420 was supposedly set "due to the importance of this number in the culture of marijuana," Bloomberg reported earlier, citing the commission's co-director of security, Stephen Peikin.
At the same time, Elon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy back shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said that he considers the allegations of fraud unfounded, and added that he is very disappointed and saddened by these claims.

The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had caused them losses.

Other plaintiffs also noted that Elon Musk's reckless remarks led to sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate.
In September, Elon Musk also accused the head of the research company Citron Research of stock market fraud.
Meanwhile, if Musk had not been able to resolve his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have faced suspension from running the company and even jail.
This, in particular, was stated by the former chairman of the commission Harvey Pitt to CNBC.
Musk is "a good guy who can't run a car company."

Trump talks about "falling in love" with Kim Jong-un
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and North Korea have reached almost love for each other, joked Donald Trump.
U.S. President Donald Trump made a good joke about his successes on the front of the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have so straightened relations that they are almost in love with each other, the American president noted.
The White House official recalled that he accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team has so launched relations with North Korea that she could not even reach the country's leadership - they simply did not pick up the phone.
At the time, the U.S. and North Korea were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing "wonderful letters" to the White House, Trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work he was also "cruel" to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
But now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders "fell in love."
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump has pointed out that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests and is closing military sites.
All these are the merits of the work of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump spoke flatteringly about Kim Jong-un from the podium of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and steps to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Singapore talks
On June 12, the first-ever talks between the leaders of the United States and North Korea took place in Singapore.

Positive results of the meeting were the cessation of nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers.
At the same time, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still being towed.
Media reported that after the Singapore summit, the U.S. sent north Korea several disarmament scenarios, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangster."

Nitsoy urged to supplant "Moscow language Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of her native language Larissa Nitsoy called for the ouster of "Russian-language Product and Moscow Language" from Ukraine.
To do this she offers a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural onslaught."
Nitsoy shared her thoughts on the "feasibility of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian edition of the Observer.
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it is even already there and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will "recover" from this "Moscow language," she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said, Russian speech used extensively on television and radio, but there was almost no russian in the public space.
At the same time, according to Nitsoy, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "expanding the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level."
Previously, Nitsoy shared her experience of maintaining the "Ukrainian-speaking regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to sue the Watsons bookstore chain, one of whom had been talking to her on Russian.
Not having achieved her own, Nitsoy threw the girl's change.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "language schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in the spelling of surnames.
Recently, Nitsoy said that the name "Rus" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The writer's anger could not be avoided even by the Security Service of Ukraine: having come there and heard the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she caused a scandal and left, slamming the door.

"You missed a few matches because of the injury you sustained at the beginning of the month.
How did you feel today?"
"If you have survived 90 minutes, then all is well!
Actually, I felt good.
Maybe at the end a little bit of a shore of strength, so that nothing happens.
And so, doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Gashnev led me to this game, for which they thank you very much!
"What do you say about the atmosphere in the team?"
"It is no secret that after victories and recover easier, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white strip, although at first it was black.
We need to continue in the same spirit and please the fans."
"Did you miss the game in a while that didn't take the field?"
"There is such a thing, a little bored, because really, unpleasant situation came out.
But again, thanks to the physiotherapist and doctors for putting them on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and pleased the fans.
And the rest is secondary."

Violations recorded in Macedonia referendum
Four incidents of electoral law violations were registered in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on renaming.
This was announced on Sunday by the interior ministry spokesman Tony Angelovsky.

We call on citizens to comply with the laws and refrain from any violations of public order and calm and any violation of the secrecy of voting," the representative of the Interior Ministry said.
Citizens in Sunday's referendum are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav republic during a solemn ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, which runs along the border between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of Northern Macedonia."
This treaty should solve not only a long-standing dispute over the name of the country, but also open Skopje way to NATO and the EU.

He explained that in previous years Russia was sometimes "designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, then along with Ebola, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, at least, in the presentation of the group of Western countries, which on this matter was quite unanimous."
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "the topic of Russia in a negative way was practically absent."
"If we carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the German Foreign Minister, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was not exactly accurate," - the politician noted, noting that Russia "was no longer some wall about which the tennis ball is trained."
The head of the Profile Committee of the Council does not rule out that this indicates a trend, which, in his opinion, "will highlight the current session of the UN General Assembly, although this trend may be fully manifested in a year, in two, three".
"I do not rule out that this session in some sense can be a turning point," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of Russia's involvement moving forward in international affairs."
He cited the situation in Syria, Iran and North Korea as an example.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," the MP added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is an "adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of our time."
"I don't want to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we are somewhere passing the point behind which the movement will no longer be a movement to reverse, it will be a movement forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context Kosachev called "the request for the Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I attended a lot of meetings of the head of the Russian delegation (at the session of the General Assembly) of Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested, now the situation is different," - said the chairman of the committee of the Council of Ministers.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve the world's problems because of the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problem of nuclear non-proliferation, the problem of migration."
"And here the request for the Russian vision becomes more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that in this sense "the current session is successful for the work of the Russian delegation, which is good for Russia."

Damascus declares its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, said Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem.
At the same time, according to him, Syria has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has an opportunity to quickly solve the problem of withdrawal of militants of the banned organization Jebhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, RIA Novosti reports.
The Foreign Minister also stressed that Damascus will have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of the Euphrates in case the Kurds want separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, negotiations with kurdish SDF forces were good until they broke down because of the U.S.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdogan agreed to establish a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by October 15.

First Deputy Speaker of the Parliament Irina Gerashchenko apologized to the convicted in Russia for "espionage" Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko for the fact that he has not been released from prisons so far.
She said this in a video message to the political prisoner, recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of Sushchenko's illegal arrest by the FSB.

Every day French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, among them there are people who know you well, starve, supporting Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course, you.
There is no international meeting, no talks, no interviews, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government, all of us, did not demand to put pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all-all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those guys who are illegally held in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea," Gerashchenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the tests will harden every Ukrainian, doing us "angrier, tougher in defending the national interests of Ukraine, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what evil is."
Recall, the correspondent of Ukrinform in France Roman Sushchenko was detained by Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 at the Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with espionage against the General Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a maximum security colony, and the Russian Supreme Court ruled that the verdict was lawful.
Russian jailers granted the last request of the Ukrainian before his stage in the colony.

Wahtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists talk about how they managed to cope with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, and the stories of popular people about the victories over cancer, gives hope to many patients.
Famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he is alive only because of his wife.
Many years ago he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a verdict.
"It's like I was hit on the skull with a hammer from below.
I fell.
Lost orientation.
They put me in the hospital.
There could not hold a spoon, could not stand, fell all the time.
We started to do tests, it turned out, bad things, the artery does not let blood.
They brought me to Moscow, they said that I had a big pist my nose in my head, I had surgery urgently.
And during the operation, the doctors behind the cyst saw a tumor," Kikabidze said in the program "Once."
The tumor was malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, Tbilisi residents even came to say goodbye to the idol on the doorstep of his house.
But the actor's wife did not allow to bury the living actor, she strongly believed that she could cope with the disease and more than a year did not leave the bed of his beloved spouse.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had critical situations, she was like a rock," the actor admitted.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, now he lives happily in his home in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time refutes rumors about his illness, then about the untimely death, which every now and then appear on the web.
The creators of the website "Peacemaker" have included in the section "Purgatory" of Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto.
The reason was "an attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine."
In addition, the head of the Foreign Ministry of the neighboring country was accused of "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "support of separatist sentiments in Ukraine," as well as participation "in the organization of provocation aimed at mass violation of Ukrainian law by Ukrainian citizens."
It should be noted that the governor of Kiev-Pecherskaya Lavra Pavel and the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriots) Onufriy were seated in the "Purgatory".
The reason was their opposition to the receipt of Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in the Carpathian Region, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for Ukraine's sovereign rights.
Authorities have called the amount of the "golden parachute" voronezh deputy governor
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the deputy governor of Voronezh region Yuri Agibalov was made under the regional law on public positions.
At the same time, the real sum of the "golden parachute" of the official released from the post was several times less than the amount announced in the media.
Such explanations were provided to the press service of the regional government.
According to the law, Agibalov's salary is 11,189 rubles.
Thus, the press service stressed, the amount of the lump sum payment amounted to 223,892 rubles, not 1 million rubles, which was written by the media.
The official received an old-age pension from July 2018.
His experience in public office is more than nine years.
The appointment of this pension and a lump sum payment to him is made immediately after dismissal from his post, RIA Novosti news agency explained.
At the same time, agibalov's payment of pension co-payments was suspended when he was appointed to the state debt, and the size of his salary did not change compared to the previous period.
Aleksandr Gusev, the governor of the region, who won the election, took office on September 15.
Agibalov was relieved of his post due to the expiration of the term of office of the head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public office in the region have ended.
On September 29, Telegram-channel Nezygar published documents, which showed that Agibalov, who had resigned from the post of deputy governor, was paid a severance pay of 23 salaries, and two days after that he again received a similar position without the prefix "Vrio".
State Duma deputy urged to tell schoolchildren about the dangers of masturbation
Onishchenko is the first deputy chairman of the education and science committee.

It is necessary to fight this at the level of educational institutions and the family, the MP added.
Gennady Onishchenko, a member of the Russian State Duma (in an interview with the radio station "Speaking Moscow":
As part of the general sex education of children, this should be done, explaining the harm, because there is a risk of a certain to the sexual health of the child, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the maturation of children comes early enough, and then there are large scissors between their puberty and the ability to officially enter into inter-sex contact.
According to Onishchenko, the solution of the problem is hindered by "hypocrisy," the silence of "problems of sexual age" and the lack of a culture of adequate education of children.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers face onanism.
The MP believes that practicing lessons about the dangers of onanism is primarily in schools of "hyperurbanized" regions.

AdG became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beats another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings are falling.
Apparently, Germans began to seriously tire of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which made the country a coveted target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The latest opinion polls show that the anti-immigrant alternative for Germany party is becoming more popular, while the positions of Merkel's ruling bloc and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the AH broke another record, rising to the second place in the ranking of people's sympathies.
The right-wing Conservatives, with 17 percent of popularity, managed to beat the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but it is impossible not to note the fact that the A.G.A., created in 2013 from a small group of Eurosceptic economists, has become a serious political force.
The leadership in the overall standings continues to hold the ruling CSU/CDU bloc, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April support of Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
Let's add that the Social Democrats are followed by the Greens (15%), the left (11%) and the Left (11%). Liberals (10%).
The Evolution of Alternatives
The Alternative for Germany party was formed in September 2012 on the basis of the group "Alternative Choice 2013" which included people from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's course, but at first focused only on economic issues, including the euro and EU engagement.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of weak EU economies, did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German brand and the complete withdrawal of the country from the European Union.
Amid the deepening immigration crisis, the ADG's political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group became a full-fledged party that occupied a niche of Eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AGG managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, winning 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of alternative to Germany will get seats in the European Parliament.
Published video with a journalist who called the citizens of Ukraine "a nation of fools"
The presenter of the political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books Ostap Drozdov admitted on the air that he considers his compatriots "a nation of fools".
They believe IN TV and don't read much.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We have not been taught a culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood," the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov's words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Independence began to fight against literature, which has the slightest hints of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of as many as 201 editions.

The death of the universe is named
The universe will last for about 140 billion years, which is ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists is published in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and sent to publish in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts came to similar conclusions by observing with the camera HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) of the Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, the scientists, working under the standard cosmological model of the Cold Dark Matter, estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
The Subaru Observatory press release notes that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the European Space Telescope's Planck data accounted for the limitations imposed on the parameters of the ZCDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the world observed would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Divide.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
Opportunity to learn the opinion of the people about pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal initiative group against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups, who registered different formulations of questions (in total, the Central Electoral Commission registered five formulations).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a request to register a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Are you in favour of the age set by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, the age at which Russian citizens are entitled to an old-age pension is not raised?"
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and most legally capaturized.
The majority of the participants of the meeting were supporters of "Just Russia" member Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all the initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (her wording was supported by 15 other subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive the invitation and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is the enemy."

"It was a difficult game, it was a difficult one.
The opponent fought with dignity, created great problems for us.
I am glad that we played well in the majority today.

And that we won is also very important"

That's why it was such a decision," Bilyaletdinov was quoted as saying by the club's press service.

In the match "Loko" - "Ahmat" Turbin's mistakes fell like a horn of abundance
Former referee of the all-union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat" and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess evgeny Turbin's refereeing in the Lokomotiv vs. Akhmat match?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his unfitness to referee the matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressures in the meeting of the fifth round "Spartak" - "Dynamo", neither Turbin, nor the leaders of the DSI did not make serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of rough receptions fell like a horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute, railwayman Eder is overwhelmed with his hands in his penalty area by defender "Ahmat" Rodolfo.
From the gate eight meters, but Turbin does not put a penalty.
- How do you assess the episode involving Idova, who was in the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball hit him in the hand?
- I believe that there was a deliberate play by the defender's hand in his penalty area.
Turbin was near the moment, clearly sees this episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment should have been seen by reserve referee Sergey Karasev.
However, all three slept through and no penalty was awarded.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice was trampled.
It was the same case when refereeing in terms of concepts supplanted and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute Turbin did not dare to remove the defender of the guests Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight against Krychowiak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card, defiantly applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Should I have shown the second mustard?
- At this point Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite on the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of refereeing, that some teams are given penalties for such violations as in the episode with Idova, and some do not.
What do you think you think of the player's words?
- Depending on what is understood by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give him up.
So, the referee does not give a second penalty in the opposite goal.
That's the principle that's being used.
And the second point is the double standards that the referee is watching who is playing.
Lokomotiv played on Saturday and "Ahmat" has serious claims to Turbin's work, because the team was infringed.
Matt Damon played accused rape judge Cavanaugh at SNL launch
American actor Matt Damon played U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
In a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The U.S. Supreme Court nominee has previously drawn attention for his emotionality and detail of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Thus, Cavanaugh repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but said that he never got drunk to unconsciousness.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on a rape charge, Cavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin at the time.
Damon also played those moments.
All I did was drink a lot and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunk virgin I've ever seen.
Everyone knows that," the judge said, played by Matt Damon.
Cavanaugh was previously elected U.S. Supreme Court Justice.
Barbra Streisand discovered strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that clones of her dead dog behave completely differently than the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, the clones look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul," the 76-year-old singer said.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog, a Coton de Toulear named Samantha, who had to be euthanized due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, named the smallest dog in the world, was cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so tiny.
U.S. ponders Naval blockade of Russia over oil and gas supplies
The U.S. may launch a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The American authorities have so zealously taken up the struggle for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main energy suppliers.
The head of the U.S. Interior Ministry, Ryan zinke, spoke about the possibility of a naval blockade the day before.
Contrary to world practice, the American Ministry of the Interior does not perform police but civilian functions, including implementing natural resource policies.
Therefore, the statement of zinke came out quite in the competence of the agency headed by him, although it was not deprived of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, zinke said the U.S. Navy controls sea lanes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
It was according to zinke that the necessity may be connected with Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
He recalled that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as well as in Eastern Europe, was the main motive for Moscow's intensification in the region, zinke said.
The Minister made it clear that the United States still expects to provide a leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the naval blockade of trade routes - an acceptable measure along the way, zinke believes.

There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former Chelsea and England captain John Terry on why he attended the match of the ninth round of the Russian Championship "Spartak" - "Rostov" (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club that I follow.
I've been following it quite recently and I was interested to see it from the outside.
I cannot say that I am a fan, as my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartak and once again I want to apologize for the decision," Terry was quoted as saying by the Chelsea fans' website.
Recall, "Rostov" with 18 points rose to third place in the standings, and "Spartak" placed in fifth place, having in the asset 15 points.
In the next round, the Red and Whites will play against Enisey on October 7, while Valeriy Karpin's men will host Orenburg the day before.
Expensive violin was handed over to the pawnshop for nothing
When a pawnbroker, LBC Boutique and Loan, in Somerville, Massachusetts, brought a violin, a pawnshop worker offered only $50 for an old and unpresentable instrument.
But the experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that it was an old and expensive tool, and sought advice from an expert.
Then it turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galliano and estimated at 250,000 dollars.
Only bows to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was recently stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the man who gave it to the pawnshop, but he does not have any previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now all violin brings to the pawnshop will be asked to play on it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL we will face an exciting confrontation: Spartak will host Rostov under Valery Karpin, a man who is not at all foreign to the "people's team" at their stadium in Tushin.
Particular piquancy of this meeting gives the fact that the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15, and they share the 3rd and 4th places in the standings, lagging behind the far-left "Senit" and being in one spot of Krasnodar, which plays tomorrow with Dynamo.
The Red and Whites have a difficult streak now: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League Massimo Carrera's team unexpectedly flew to Rapid, and recently lost at home to "Ahmat".
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, Spartak beat the Chornomorets cup with a minimum score and it is too early to say whether Russia's most popular club has come close to a crisis.
Rostov could not win three matches in a row, but they haven't known defeats for five matches.
Let's see if Karpin manages to extend the winless streak with such a crucial match for himself.
The previous meeting between Karpinski Rostov and Spartak ended in favor of the capital team.
Beginning at 19:00.

London erupts in accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the Cold War, said British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson.
But Britain will defend its values, he said during a speech at the ruling Conservative Party congress in Birmingham.
Threats are growing, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, enemies are operating in gray areas with the help of cyberattacks and false news, the minister added.
But the biggest of them is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Moscow has repeatedly denied such statements of Western politicians, TASS reports.
At the same time, the head of the British Foreign Office Jeremy Hunt said that Russia will have to pay a high price if it does not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.

The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on EU and NATO membership, subject to a change in the country's name.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighboring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister zoran zayev, an ardent supporter of the renaming of the republic to Northern Macedonia.
Preparations for the referendum and today's vote are being monitored by international organizations.
Jan Petersen, head of the observation mission of the Bureau of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, told Euronews how the observer's work was organized:
Approximately 100 teams travelled across the country to observe the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to their closure, then the counting of votes and the preparation of protocols.
During the month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, which monitored the preparations for the voting, the work of the media, the implementation of the law on campaign financing and the organization of the referendum.
Fai Dulgheri: "About 500 foreign observers are closely monitoring the voting process.
Observer teams record the details of what is happening and communicate with the members of the electoral commissions to then present them in the final report."
Translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding.
This was announced on the International Day of The Translator, September 30, by professional interpreter-synchronist Barbel Sachse.
She has been translating from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"Germans like to calmly plan events, and russians, as they say in the proverb, "long harness, but quickly go."
But I think it does not play a significant role for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter," the expert said in a commentary to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries can not do without each other, "it is enough to know the history."
And in the future, Sachs said, there is no point in Germany ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny," she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country was trying to "tie up relations" with Russia and maintain them.
According to her, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is being built from the Coast of Russia to Germany along the Baltic Sea, is particularly important for Berlin.

"It's ugly nepotism"
Viewers are outraged by Agutin's choice on the show "The Voice"
Viewers of the show "Voice 60" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen fraud".
When in blind auditions he learned the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and would not turn to the performer.
But the son's feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative in his team.
At that time, many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor bias in the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the star's father absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, resented the nepotism of the ugly and frank dragging of their close relatives on the final ladder.
I even doubted that Agutin would have the strength and conscience not to drag her father to the first place to the end," Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina reasoned in the program "The Man from TV."
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father Leonid Agutin "dropped" the beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still wants to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not the case, the audience wants an objective evaluation and see in the final really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the members of the "Voice" from Agutin's team - they were doomed."
"Last time Agutin showed how much he loves his dad, and today he had to show himself as a professional."
"The contest has lost its meaning."
"Remove from the project two talented people and leave in the project his dad who does not sing and whispers, how can you then name a mentor?",
"I like the way Dad sings, organize a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert."
It's The Voice, not the Cool Relatives show.
"It was unprofessional on Agutin's part."
"Then you have to offer to perform on your own show dad, not on the show, which is done for the money of Channel 1."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre merged, and Agutin's father was brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on stage and on screens the same faces for decades!
Because you can't break through nepotism!"
"What have you been waiting for?
It's Russia!
There's a lot of nepotism all around.
And the money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theatre of the absurd continues!"
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" at blind auditions came the son of Gradsky.
Then it didn't occur to me to take my son to his own team.
Moreover, he said, "Come on, get out of here, everything is clear."
Agutin couldn't act like a professional.

According to him, now the scientific community is developing directions for such works.
"There is no consolidated opinion yet," the scientist stressed.
He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study space sources of radio radiation," Petrukovich added.
He also believes that the Moon could be used for robotics tests, use local resources for construction.
In addition, cosmonauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on the Earth's satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help determine how life appears on planets.
Earlier, the head of Roscosmos Corporation said that in an optimistic version of the Russian Federation can carry out a manned flight to the moon by 2030.
Offended customer dumped a basket of faeces in the store 7-Eleven
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old from St. Petersburg, Florida, said he "had a tooth" on the manager of the 7-Eleven chain's 24-hour store, who was kicked out of the store in May for inappropriate behavior.
And decided to take revenge on his enemy in an original way.
At half past two in the morning he went into the store and threw the contents of the basket on the shelves and on some of the goods on the shelves.
In the basket were faeces and urine, which Simms "borrowed" from a nearby mobile biotoilet.
The police officers who arrived at the scene arrested the "vindictive".
He was remanded in custody and released pending trial on $300 bail.
He was charged with trespassing and criminal offence, and banned from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although Simms' crime looks more ridiculous than serious, the sentence may be quite severe, as he has repeatedly broken the law: he is listed for large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of a weapon, drunk driving and animal cruelty.

- It's hard for the guys to score goals.
We met two teams, which had two defeats before this meeting.
We came out "on the teeth."
The special brigade played well, throwing two pucks.
You can see that the guys have a very large psychological burden.
They are in a hurry when the attacks are completed, so it does not work.
After such time it is necessary to pass and move on.
- Herman Mihajlovic, how do you like the game of Yerofeyev?
- You know, I really liked the game.
Emotional, nothing superfluous, as we asked.
He climbed on the goal and created chances, as in the episode with Vitaly Kravtsov, when he did not score in an empty goal.
For the first game very impressed.
I think we will involve him in the games further.

I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful
Sergey Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything and it was very painful
Russian Williams driver Sergey Sirotkin commented on the result of the Russian Grand Prix race.
"Honestly, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner I was between two cars, which immediately squeezed me.
I lost all those positions that I played at the start, the moment, immediately.
I found myself in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the others came to the pit stop, we will get into the "clean air" and return the pace, but the rubber was gone.
Plus I struggled with my partner, he also had contact.
I understand he made a little mistake.
We found ourselves in this situation on the most unnecessarily track of the season, I couldn't do anything and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," Sirotkin was quoted as saying by RIA Novosti.
Recall that Sirotkin in the race at the Russian Grand Prix finished 18th, the winner was the British driver of Mercedes Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev called the suspension of Glushakov and Yetenko from the basis of "Spartak" absurd
President of the Russian Tennis Federation (FTR) Shamil Tarpishchev commented on the suspension of Spartak Moscow players Denis Glushakov and Andrey Yetenko from training with the main squad after a liking for criticism of the team's head coach Massimo Carrera, Reports Sport Weekend.
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
It's stupid to pay attention to such things.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the discord in the team.
First, these are poems, you can read and perceive them as you like.
I wouldn't react to that if Carrera were.
Everyone has an opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to bury.
Just because Glushakov and Venko are like, it doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to understand the situation.
And it doesn't serve the normal climate in the team.
Today Spartak do not have a game, so this situation was not necessary to inflate at all.
Maybe we should have laughed at it together.
"Spartak" has a lot of disrepair in different lines, there is a lack of chemistry after the introduction of young people.
The relations within the team do not seem to add optimism before this match," Tarpishchev said.
The game between the two teams will take place on September 30 and will start at 19.00 Moscow time.
John Terry, who previously refused to join Spartak, took charge of Chelsea's youth team.
"Sirius" students discussed natural technologies with scientists
Pupils of the "Sirius" educational center in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatov Institute."
The researchers' speech took place within the framework of the program of the Global International Forum of Converged and Nature-like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary "Kody Kurchatov" during which Mikhail Kovalchuk, the president of the Kurchatov Institute and a member-correspondent of the Russian Academy of Sciences, spoke about global challenges as the driving force of the development of civilization.
The scientist's lecture is published on the Sirius website.
Schoolchildren have learned that modern technologies need a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to develop such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will help nature-like technologies, which are working today on young scientists.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, as well as talked about the risks that inevitably arise in the creation of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal benefit.
It's the explosive growth of medical technology, it's improving the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is a second side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is a downside - purposeful intervention in human life.
There are always risks.
There was a car - people began to die under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I am creating a medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction," REN TV quoted the scientist as saying.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
Speakers were The Ph.D. in Physics and Mathematics, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-nature-like technologies of the Kurchatov Institute, Yulia Diakova, and vyacheslav Demin, head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS technologies.
The Sirius Educational Center in Sochi was established by the Talent and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure on the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational center is to identify, develop and further professional support for gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online Olympiad on Information Security "Cyber calling" will be sent to study at Sirius.

Macedonia: referendum did not take place due to low turnout
The referendum was intended to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country "Northern Macedonia".
Greece objected to the Macedonians' use of the name of their historic province.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav Republic the opening of the route to NATO and later to the EU.
But, as EFE agency reports, only 34% of the turnout at Sunday's plebiscite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only advisory, it was possible that the authorities in Skopje would decide not to give up the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the polls closed, Macedonian Prime Minister zoran zaev, a supporter of the change of name, said that if there was more "yes" among the votes cast, Macedonia would change the name, despite the unattainable quorum.

Kemerovchan outraged herd of sheep in the cemetery
On September 30, a report from an eyewitness appeared on the well-known Kemerovo social network page that horned animals were roaming freely in one of the local cemeteries.
Animals a considerable herd walked between the fences and plucked grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some of the locals noted that in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery there is no harm, and their appetite can even help in clearing the area of weeds and grass, but some of the city's residents did not like the behavior of animals:
"It's a grave, not a pasture.
There's nothing for sheep to do there.
You can't say about sheep, of course, that they are blaspheming, but it's not the case." (the style is preserved), - said in her message indignant Kemerovchanka.
Anyway, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and soon the necessary measures will be taken.
To push and dominate - how is it right?
There is no word to press.
That's right - to dominate.
The word "push" in the meaning of "to gravitate, to influence, to influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound of "a" instead of "o" in the word "to dominate."
We use this word to believe that it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "to dominate" etymologically are not only not close, but even in some sense are opposite.
See for yourself.
To dominate (turk.-book, outdated) means "pretty, full, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy."
To be satisfied, pleasure - kindred words.
Previously, it still had the meaning "not to depend on anything, to have a self-satisfied value" - "to dominate yourself."
The Old Slavic "doy" is related to the words "to tell" and "will."
To press, to suppress - completely different.
These words have truly intimidating "relatives": daos - "wolf" (crushing sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaid - "to oppress."
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "to dominate" as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter forced them to enter into contaminants.
Thus, we have this very "d'a" that is used on the letter through "a" that is, in a good way, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of origining and developing these words.
So, that's right - to dominate.
But this word is outdated, in its correct meaning is no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative influence on you from above, use the word "pressure."
You can also use a "pressure" design, but remember that it is an office.

Russia has shielded itself from terrorists with the help of the operation in Syria
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 terrorists were destroyed by the Russian Air and Space Forces.
This was announced on the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former head of the VKS, the head of the Committee of the Federation Council on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of means of defeat from the air: Air and space forces have carried out and continue to carry out all strikes precisely against terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist targets have been destroyed in Syria in three years - for example, ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the jihadists' defenses were hacked - this was a decisive contribution to the advance of Syrian government forces, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including Islamic State (IS, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, about four thousand fighters from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the side of IS, TASS reports.
And we are talking only about the recorded persons, not counting those who have not been identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter our country freely.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant frontiers - otherwise this evil "would have poured into us."

Syria accuses U.S. of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem accused the US and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support for terrorism.
The coalition has completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas it targeted, and has massacred civilians, including children and women.
These killings under international law are war crimes," he said.
Muallem said the U.S. and its partners provided "direct support to terrorists" as the targets of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided with "sowing chaos, death and destruction along the way."
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost complete, and the country has become more safe and stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria of an illegal foreign presence, and priority in rebuilding the country will be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for Reconciliation of Warring Parties in the Republic, Lt. Gen. Vladimir Savchenko, said that two U.S. F-15s struck the Syrian province of Deir Ezzor with banned phosphorous munitions.
The U.S. has denied all the allegations.
President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko believes that respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to Kharkiv region, commenting on Hungary's issuance of its passports in the Carpathian Region.
Defending Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine," Poroshenko said.
According to Poroshenko, he as president will protect Ukrainian citizens, wherever they are - in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Foreign Ministry in the passport scandal with Hungary, which is the intention to expel the consul of this country from Beregovo.
"I fully share every letter that is said by the Foreign Ministry," the President said.
As "FACTY" reported, on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment of extradition to Ukrainian citizens in the Hungarian consulate in Beregovo Hungarian passports.
At the same time, they took an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavel Klimkin noted that the Hungarian consul, who appears on the video with the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, should leave the territory of Ukraine either by the decision of Budapest itself, or will be expelled by Kiev.
It has also become known that the prosecutor's office of the region has opened a criminal case on the fact of issuing Hungarian passports.
The incident is qualified under the article "Treason."

Khakassian media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Khakasia and appoint a new head of the republic, as well as decide on the fate of zimin.
Putin had already visited Khakasia in January this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president's favorite places to stay.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the start of the armed conflict in Syria for seven years.
Some five million people have fled to other countries, most notably neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, the hostilities are nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
This was stated by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem, speaking at the UN: "The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The Government is continuing reconstruction work in the areas destroyed by terrorists, returning them to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have made life difficult for people and deprived them of their livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and to allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the U.S. and EU countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, saying that a political solution to the conflict must be found first.
Volkswagen pleaded guilty to dieselgate in January 2017.
Last December, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the company's U.S. division, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The group's losses are estimated at at least 25 billion euros.
This amount includes not only fines and compensation.

In February, the company's management said that the obligations have already been fulfilled for 83% of cars, so that the program will be completed ahead of schedule.
Volkswagen is trying to compensate for the losses and regain the trust of customers.
Thus, recently the management of the concern has changed again, as well as announced a large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: the authorities got this right in February this year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UOC with the actions of fascists
Metropolitan Hilarion, head of the synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against Jews.
"It's like in Nazi Germany to put a yellow pointed star on a Jew, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created," the Metropolitan said on the air of Rossiya-24 TV channel (quoted by Interfax).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences at a time when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and "put it outside the law," the cleric believes.
"This is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Supreme Council are happy to work on the implementation of bills No.4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No.4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No.5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves the renaming of the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The governor of Pochaevskaya Laurel called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
Metropolitan Vladimir, the governor of st. Assumption of Pochaev's laurel, made a call to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the website of the monastery.
At different times in the history of our predecessors and relatives in faith and spirit Christians had to practice their faith and defend their shrines.
Taking into account the situation, both the information we have and the death threats that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to go through something," the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
The governor of the laurel also stressed that it is likely that you will "need your physical presence."
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threaten to kill, and therefore protect their shrine."
Who cares about the fate of Pochaev's laurel - an Orthodox Ukrainian and a world-wide shrine, one should be ready to protect it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to go on about those who mislead believers.
UOC has the canonical status defined by Tomos of October 29, 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to make it dependent on the news patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has," the governor of the laurel said.
He recalled that the UOC has been canonically independent and completely independent in its management since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Tomos has our church already.
What other Tomos do we need?" said Metropolitan Vladimir Pochayevsky, urging believers and all citizens to wonder whether other denominations of Tomos are independent from the Vatican.
Believers to some extent have sorted out and decided which temple to go to them.
However, someone wants to sow hostility and discord again.
Some people are envious of the domes on the temples they want to destroy," the priest said.
Pochaev laurel is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurel is located on the top of the Pochaev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopol.
The first historical information about it date back to the beginning of the 13th century.

According to the spokesman, the current referendum decides on the renaming of the country and nothing more, while the strategic goal of the party is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov refused to take part in the referendum on September 30.
He explained that he chose the name for the country 27 years ago in the referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader considers the renaming of the country a negative factor.
"A new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being created," Ivanov said.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic - the Republic of Northern Macedonia - was signed by the foreign ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 this year during a solemn ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, which runs the border between the two countries.
This treaty should resolve the long-standing dispute over the name of the country, as well as Skopje's path to NATO and the EU, TASS reminds.
Fire breaks out at Istanbul 'meme chef' restaurant
In Istanbul restaurant Nusret, whose chef Nusret Gekce became famous for the manner of salting steaks and became a hero of the meme, there was a fire during a fire show with dishes, reports Sputnik.
According to preliminary data, the waiter mixed up additives for meat steaks, preparing on fire.
As a result, the flames flared even more and spread to the guests sitting behind the bar.
Five people- two waiters and three tourists from the Czech Republic - were reportedly seriously injured.
At the same time, the Czech Foreign Ministry said that only two Czech tourists were injured.
According to the diplomatic service, the injured woman suffered burns to 35% of her body and 15% to the man, RIA Novosti reports.
In this case, we are talking about second-degree burns, and in a woman - with deep penetration into the structure of the skin.
Turkish chef Nusret Gekce is known on the Internet for his exquisite way of sprinkled steaks with salt and spices.
It was reported that he had ordered a large-scale PR campaign in different countries, in which Leonardo DiCaprio visited the Restaurant Of Nusrat in Dubai.
On April 1, a fire broke out in the "Old Barn" restaurant in Kazan.
The fire engulfed the roof of a two-story building on an area of 450 square meters.

The EU has allocated 1.5 million to help the victims in Indonesia
The European Union (EU) has allocated Indonesia 1.5 million to deal with the consequences of the earthquake and tsunami.
This was announced on September 30 by the press service of the European Commission.
In order to monitor the provision of assistance, the European Commission has sent its experts to the region.
As noted, the funds will be used to disinfect, as well as provide the victims with food, water, temporary shelters and medicines.
The Commission also granted the Indonesian authorities access to satellite maps of the European Emergency Service Copernicus (Copernicus) to assess the damage.
The United States has also expressed its readiness to assist in the aftermath of the disaster, said Heather Nauert, the head of the U.S. State Department's press office, in a statement.
It is also reported that the U.S. diplomatic mission in Indonesia has not received reports of injured American citizens.

U.S. boosts opiate production in Afghanistan
The sharp aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 was much talked about in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in Afghan territory, the militants have unleashed a real terrorist war against the state authorities and civilians of the country.
This year was a record for the number of bloody terrorist attacks that killed thousands of ordinary Afghans," Patrushev said.
Afghanistan's woes did not begin yesterday.
After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group "Al-Kaida" (prohibited in The Russian Federation), which was sitting in Afghanistan.
Less than a month later, America and NATO allies launched the military operation "Enduring Freedom" there.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of American contingent and now on Afghan soil.
And peaceful life is even more elusive than it was then.
U.S. troops have been driven over the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they buy off the militants for money - as long as they do not touch them.
The Afghan government controls a smaller part of the country - 40 percent, according to Patrushev.
50% - the Taliban (prohibited in Russia).
Another 10% are for ISIS terrorists (prohibited in Russia).
But they grow fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly the same as they did not in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be comfortable with that.
It is also satisfied that in the 17 years of the American presence the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
Colossal growth of areas sown with opium poppies and multibillion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in the referendum on EU and NATO membership, subject to the change of the name of the country.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as the result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbour as the right to be called Macedonia, seeing such a name as an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkowski, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will enshrine the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises that cannot make absolutely everyone happy."
The country is being renamed by the ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Sorian Zaev.
Against - conservative opposition and president of the country Gheorghe Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement, believe that the current socialist government led by zaev imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
It is obvious that there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Fai Dulgheri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice made by the citizens of Macedonia will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole."
