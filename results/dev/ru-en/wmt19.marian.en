The number of recruits from Ukraine preparing to send to Donbass was named
Official representative of the People's Police of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) Andriy Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send at least 3 thousand recruits to Donbass.
According to him, thus Kiev plans to "though somehow to equip the units."
"The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, mass layoffs have led to low staffing of units," - said Marochko, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real figures of Ukrainians drafted into the army can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the operation of the united forces (OOS).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to strengthening the role of Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
In late August 2018, the situation in Donbass escalated due to the murder of DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities qualified the incident as a terrorist attack.
Several people involved in the explosion were detained during the investigation of the criminal case.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian special services.

The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave.

In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue remains open on the Irish border.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has previously sued Tesla CEO Ilon Mask due to his tweeting of the company's possible repurchase.
Last month, Mask announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.

Nitso urged to displace "Moscow language Ukrainian product"
The Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of their native language Larissa Nitsoy called to displace from Ukraine "Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow language."
To do this she offers a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural onss."
Nitsoy shared her views on the "expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian publication "Explicator."
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now preparing - it is even already there and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians "heal" from this "Moscow language," she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, earlier Russian speech was widely used on television and radio, but in the public space it is practically gone.
At the same time, according to Nitsoy, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "expanding the borders for the Ukrainian speech at the legislative level."
Earlier, Nitso shared her experience in maintaining the "Ukrainian-speaking regime" in the children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the Watsons bookstore network, one of which was communicating with her in Russian.
Not having achieved her, Nitsy threw the surrender into the girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians she calls "language sulphire," calling on Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in writing surnames.
Recently, Nitso said that the name "Rus" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The anger of the writer could not escape even the security service of Ukraine: when she came there and heard the conversations of employees in Russian, she made a scandal and left, slamming the door.

Kosachev: Russia's negative topic was practically absent at the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly
Konstantin Kosachev, head of the Federation Council's Foreign Affairs Committee, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not rule out that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global global problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric, to which we have almost been used in recent years with regard to Russia, has now been magnitude more muted," the Senator said in an interview published on Sunday by the Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper.
He explained that in previous years Russia was sometimes "signed as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with the fever of Ebola, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, at least in the statement of a group of Western countries, which expressed quite unanimously on this account."
At the 73rd session, Kosachev emphasized, "Russia's theme was practically absent in a negative way."
"If we carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the German Foreign Minister, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at least, the choir was not exactly accurate," the politician noted, noting that Russia "has not been a kind of wall, which is trained by the strikes of tennis ball."
The head of the Sovfed Committee does not rule out that this testifies to a certain trend, which, in his opinion, "will allocate the current session [the UN General Assembly], although to the full extent this trend may manifest in two, three years later."
Kosachev admitted, explaining that "the current session cannot be a turning session in a way," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "too many examples of Russia's involvement in international affairs."
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," the parliamentarian added.
This is due to the fact that there is "adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just possible - an integral participant in solving global problems of modern times."
"I don't want to make a mistake, but I have the feeling that we're going through somewhere a point beyond which the movement will no longer be a backward movement, it will be a move forward," he added.
In this context, Kosachev described another "interesting and important feeling" as "a Russian-prosequire for the Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I saw with great pleasure that if another year or twenty years ago, the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested, now the situation is different," said the chairman of the committee of the Council of Federation.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, there are no answers to questions about how to solve the world problems due to the obvious deficit of ideas in the global space, the deficit of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problem of migration."
Kosachev expressed his confidence: "And here the request for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that in this regard, "the current session is successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

To fight this is at the level of educational institutions and families, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Govorit Moscow":
As part of the general sexual education of children, this should be done, explaining the detriment, because there is a risk of a child defined for sexual health, both a boy and a girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the ripening of children comes early enough, and then there are large scissors between their puberty and the opportunity to officially enter into contact intersex.
According to Onishchenko, the solution to the problem is hampered by "dealing," concealing the "sex problem" and the lack of a culture of adequate education of children.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers face onnism.
The MP believes that to practice lessons on the harm of onanism is primarily in schools of "hyperurbanized" regions.

AdG became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" hits another record of popularity, and the ratings of Angela Merkel fall.
Apparently, the Germans began to become seriously tired of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, thanks to which the country became a co-indedicated target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The latest polls speak most of all about this, according to which the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming more popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Seehofer weaken.
This week, AdG broke another record, rising to the second place in the ranking of popular sympathies.
The right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass the social democrats, who have about 16% of the popularity.
The gap in one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but it should be noted that the established in 2013 AdG from a small group of economists-Eurological confescules has become a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings continues to hold the ruling bloc CSU/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - in April, the support of Angela Merkel was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also lowered.
Today, 48% of Germans are in support of Angela Merkel, which is 7% lower than last year.
We would like to add that the social democrats are "green" (15%), left (11%) and liberals (10%).
The Evolution of "Alternatives"
The "Alternative for Germany" Party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the "Alternative Choice 2013" group, which included migrants from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially joined the opposition to the government course, but at first it was engaged only in economic issues, including the problems of the euro and cooperation within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed the "sponsoring" of the weak EU economies by Germany, did not rule out the possibility of returning to the German brand and the complete exit of the country from the European Union.
Against the background of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the AdG political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group became a full-fledged party, which occupied a niche of Eurosceptics and began harshly criticizing the government for the failure of immigration policy.
At the last parliamentary elections in 2017, AdG managed to get into the Bundestag for the first time, having received 94 deputy seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the "Alternatives for Germany" get a seat in the European Parliament.
A video with a journalist who called the citizens of Ukraine "a nation of fools" has been published
Leading political talk show on Ukrainian TV, author of two books by Ostap Drozdov in a live broadcast admitted that he considers his compatriots "a nation of fools."

"We have not been instilled in the culture of reading and text-the-chasing culture since childhood," the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting Nezalezhnaya began to fight literature, which has the slightest hints at criticism of the Kiev authorities, prohibiting the import of as much as 201 editions.

Named the death term of the Universe
The universe exists about 140 billion years, which is ten times the age of the observed world equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists is laid out in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is aimed at publishing in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts came to such conclusions, observing with the help of the camera HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) telescope Subaru for about ten million galaxies.
After tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, scientists, working within the framework of the standard cosmological model of the CDM (S. Cold Dark Matter), assessed the pace of the expansion of the Universe, which was slightly slower than previously believed.
In the press release of the Observatory Subaru noted that the observations allowed to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of distribution of matter in the universe, and the data of the European space telescope Planck specified the limitations imposed on the parameters of the ECDM.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the Universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments in favor of the fact that the observed world will cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Greater Break.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
Opportunity to learn the opinion of the people about the pension reform is postponed indefinitely
On Saturday, a meeting of the federal referendum group against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups who registered different formulations of questions (in total, the CEC registered five formulations).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a request to register a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "You are for the age established by the legislation on pension as of July 1, 2018, after which citizens of Russia receive the right to appoint old-age pension, do not increase?"
This wording was registered by a Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and legally as a mercenary.
The majority of participants in the meeting were supporters of Just Russia member Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the CPRF (four sub-groups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier Sviridov said to "Vedomosti," that the invitations were sent to all initiators, and the consent to come was expressed by representatives of about 40 subgroups.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (its wording was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive invitations and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend, and who is the enemy."

In the match "Loko" - "Ahmat" Turbin's mistakes fell like from the horns of abundance
Former judge of the All-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the referee Eugene Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the championship of Russia "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat" and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the refereeing Eugene Turbin in the match "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat"?
- I believe that this referee confirmed his unsuitable for judging the matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressures in the meeting of the fifth round of "Spartak" - "Dynamo," neither Turbin himself, nor the leaders of the DSI made serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow to affect the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private passes of rough techniques fell like a horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute of the railway Eder falls with the help of hands in his penal area defender "Ahmata" Rodolfo.
From the gate eight meters, but Turbin does not put a penalty.
- How do you assess the episode with Idov, who was in the 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball hit him in the hand?
- I believe that there was a deliberate game with the defender's hand in his penalty area.
Turbin was near the moment, sees this episode well and his first assistant on the right.
This moment was also supposed to be seen by the reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three slept, and the penalty was not assigned.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice was poprana.
This was the case when the refereeing by concept displaced and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute Turbin did not dare to remove the defender of the guests Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight against Kryhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think about this episode?
Was it necessary to show the second "gorchichnik"?
"At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite in the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of judging that some teams put a penalty for violations such as in the episode with Idov, and some not.
What do you assess the words of the football player?
- Looking at what to understand under double standards.
There was a penalty.
He was not given.
So the referee does not give a second penalty in the opposite gate.
Here is the principle that is used.
And the second moment of double standards, that the judge looks, who plays.
Here he played on Saturday "Lokomotiv" and "Ahmata" has serious claims to the work of Turbin, because the team was infringed.
Matt Damon plays the accused of rape by the judge of Cavano at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the US Supreme Court Brett Cavano, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new Saturday Night Live program on NBC TV channel.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kawon at the hearings in the Senate on charges of rape.
The candidate to the US Supreme Court previously drew attention to his emotionality and details of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Thus, Kavano repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but said that he never drank to remembrance.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavano said that in those years he was a virgin.
These moments also beat Damon.
I only did that I drank a lot and did not think about sex at all.
I was the most proud, the most drunken virgin, whom anyone has ever seen.
Everyone knows it," said Matt Damon's judge.
Earlier, Kavano was elected the Supreme Judge of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behave completely differently than the original pet.
"They are not similar.
In fact, [clones] look like it, but it is impossible to clone the soul," - said the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog of the coton de-toleaire named Samantha, which had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the dog of the chihuahua breed called Mircle Milly, called the smallest dog in the world, cloned for the 49th time.
Specialists are engaged in cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The U.S. thought about Russia's sea blockade due to oil and gas supplies
In the U.S., Russia can start a sea blockade to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The U.S. authorities are so zealous in the struggle for success in the world market of hydrocarbons that they are ready to resort to the sea blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main suppliers of energy.
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke told about the possibility of a sea blockade the day before.
Contrary to world practice, the U.S. Ministry of Internal Affairs does not perform police, but civil functions, including implementing policies in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinka's statement was quite within the competence of the department headed by him, although it was not deprived of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinka said that thanks to the US naval forces, they control seaways in the Middle East and can block them if necessary.
According to Zinka, the need could be connected with Washington's desire to prevent Russian supply to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute the supply of energy resources in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow's activation in the region, Zinke believes.
The minister made it clear that the U.S. still expects to ensure leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to displace Russia and Iran, and the sea blockade of trade routes - an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke believes.

Translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
Thementality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding.
This was on the International Translator Day, September 30, told the professional interpreter-synchronist Barbel Sakse.
She has been engaged in translations from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"The Germans love to plan events quietly, and the Russians, as the proverb says, "they harness for a long time, but they go quickly."
But it seems to me that for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of the interpreter, it does not play a significant role," - said the specialist in the comment "RIA Novosti."
According to the interpreter, in order to understand that two countries can not do without each other, "it is enough to know the history."
And in the future, Sakse noted, Germany does not make sense to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, it makes no sense to try to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny," she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country is trying to "tie relations" with Russia and support them.
According to her, the project of the "Nord Stream - 2" gas pipeline is especially important for Berlin, which is being built from the Russian coast to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

"It's ugly hump"
Viewers outraged by Agutin's choice at Voice show
The audience of the Voice 60+ show accuses Leonid Agutin's mentor of "unlike humpness and arrogantness."
When, in the blind auditions, he recognized from the first notes the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin many hoped that he would remain neutral and would not turn to the performer.
But the son's feelings took over, and he chose a relative to his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor biased in the first stage.
But the "joke" erupt, and the father of the star absolutely unjustifiedly took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin of such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, were outraged by the idimbursy of the ugly and frank dragging of our close relatives to the final staircase.
I even doubted that Agutina would have enough strength and conscience not to drag to the end of her dad to the first place," said Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "Man from TV."
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin "merced" the beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining this by the fact that the audience wants to see him in the show.
But as it turned out, this is not the case, the audience wants an objective assessment and see in the final really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants of "Voice" from the team of Agutin - they were doomed."
"The last time Agutin showed how he loves Dad, and today he had to show himself a professional."
"The contest has lost its meaning."
"Did two talented people out of the project and leave in the project your dad who does not whisper, how can you then call a mentor?,"
"I like Dad to like to have a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert."
This is the show "Voice," not the show "Cruit Relatives."
"It was unprofessional from Agutin's side."
"Thening it is necessary to offer Papa to perform on his own show, not on the show, which is being done for the money of Channel 1."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should cause me to understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre bessed, and Papa Agutin brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on stage and from the screens the same faces for decades!
Yes, because you don't get through the humors!"
"What have you expected?
This is Russia!
Around a gown and a hum-beate.
And the money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The absurd theatre continues!"
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" on blind auditions came the son of Gradsky.
Then the meter did not come to take his son to his own team.
What's more, he said, "Come on, go from here, everything is clear."
Agutin did not act as a professional.

I had a good start, and in the second turn I was between two cars that immediately squeezed me.
I lost all the positions that played at the start, the moment, immediately.
It turned into a very bad position.
I's stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the others had come to the pit stop, we would get into the "clean air," and the pace would come, but there was no rubber anymore.
Plus he struggled with the partner, there was also contact with him.
As I understand, he made a little mistake.
We were in such a situation on the most non-stake track of the season, I could not do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," says Sirotkin RIA Novosti.

Carrer's actions were absolutely absurd.
Such things are not the unsusubly stupidity to pay attention to such things.
I absolutely disagree with what Carrer does.
This only deepens the dispersing in the team.
First, these are verses, reading and perceive them as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted to it in the place of Carrer.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to sly.
If Glushakov and Even put likes, it does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks flexibility in the perception of the situation.
And this does not serve as a normal climate in the team.
Today, "Spartak" has no game, so this situation was not required to inflate.
Maybe it was worth laughing at it together.
"Spartak" has much not in order in different lines, there is inadetriation after the introduction of young people.
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match, "- said Tarpishchev.

"The use of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a tremendous good.
This is an explosive growth of medical technologies, it is an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is also a second side.
The development of natural-like technologies actually has a technological reproduction of living nature systems.
There is a reverse side - targeted interference in human life.
Risks are always there.
The car appeared - people began to die under the wheels.
But cars still use.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I create a new medical technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction," - quotes the scientist REN TV.

Kemerovo residents outraged the herd of rams in the cemetery
On September 30, on the famous Kemerovo page, a report appeared from an eyewitness that one of the local cemeteries is freely walking horned animals.
The animals walked between the fences and the animals slept.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some of the local residents noted that in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery there is no harm, and their appetite can even help in clearing the territory of weeds and grass thickets, but some of the inhabitants of the city did not have to like the behavior of animals:
"They are graves, not pastures.
There is nothing for the rams to do there.
About the rams, of course, you can not say that they blaspheme, but still it is not the case." (the style is preserved) - said in a communication indignant Kemerovochanka.
One way or another, some of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and in the near future the necessary measures will be taken.
To press and to do - how is it right?
There is no word to be pressed.
It is correct to do it.
The word "squeeze" in the meaning of "grave, to exert influence, influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound instead of [o] in the word "add."
We use this word, believing that it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "add" etymologically not only are not close, but even in some sense the opposite.
Make sure of it yourself.
To get (church.--book, obsolete) means "rather, full, enough to be sufficient for anyone or anything, to satisfy."
Satisfied, pleasure - kinship words.
Previously, he still had the meaning of "do not depend on anything, to have a self-suspending meaning" - "to do it."
Staroslavian "dollti" is related to the words "lod" and "will."
To suppress, to suppress - completely different.
These words have truly frightening "parents": daos - "wolf" (pressing sheep), deyja - "dying" and dvaid - "press."
A similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "add," as well as the imminent obsoleteness of the latter, forced them to join the contamination.
Thus we have this very "d [a] toleak," which is used in the letter through "a," which is, in a good way, is wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
So, it's right to do it.
But this word is outdated, in its right meaning is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word "dain."
You can also use the structure "pressure," but remember that it is a stationery.

through the operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
In three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 terrorists were destroyed by the Air-Space Forces of the Russian Federation.
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former commander of the Armed Forces, the head of the Federation Council for Defense and Security Victor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of weapons from the air: the Aerospace forces have applied and continue to strike all the targets exactly on the objects of terrorists.
According to Bondarev, in three years in Syria tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed - for example, it is about warehouses of ammunition, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian air strikes, the defense of jihadists was hacked - it was a decisive contribution to the promotion of the Syrian government forces, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of which had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic were under the control of terrorist groups, including "Islamic State" (IS, banned in Russia) and "Jebhat-en-Nusru" (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the side of ISIS.
And we are talking only about the fixed persons, not counting those who were not identified, Bondarev emphasized.
Most of them were trained and ready at any time to take arms in their hands, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria Russia is fighting international terrorism at distant borders - otherwise this evil would "snant to us."

Metropolitan Hilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UOC with the actions of fascists
The head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate into the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It's like the Jew to encome a yellow pointed star in Germany, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and it was for this purpose that this bill was created," said the Metropolitan on the air of Rossiya-24 TV channel (Interfax quote).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control of the UOC and "put it outlaw," the priest believes.
"This is the Ukrainian church, and believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier it became known that deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (about the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).

The deputy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
Metropolitan Vladimir, the Vice-Ministry of the Pochaev Lavra, called on the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines to protect the Orthodox faith.
The text of his appeal to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) is published on Saturday on the site of the monastery.
At different times of history, Christians had to profess their faith and their sacred objects to their predecessors and to protect their shrines.
Given the situation that has developed and according to the information we have, and the threats of reprising, which spread, it is clear that we will have to survive something," the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
Also, the Lavra's governor stressed that, probably, "it will be necessary your physical presence."
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren are in spirit threatened with revenge, and therefore we will protect our shrine."
Who is not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - the Orthodox Ukrainian and the world shrine, it is necessary to be ready to protect it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged those who mislead the believers not to be concerned.
The UOC has a canonical status defined by Tomos from October 29, 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to put into dependence on the newstriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has," - said the Lavra's deputy.
He reminded that since October 1990, the UOC has been canonically independent and completely independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What more Tomos we need?" said Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaevsky, calling on believers and all citizens to wonder if other denominations Tomos have other denominations, are they independent of the Vatican?
Believers to some extent figured out and decided in what temple they to walk.
However, someone wants to sow hostility and dissife again.
Some people are envious that the domes shine on the temples, which they want to destroy," - said the priest.
Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurels are located on the top of the Pochaev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.

The main Macedonian oppositionist refused to vote at the referendum
On Sunday, September 30, in Macedonia, a referendum is held on the intergovernmental treaty with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are invited to answer one question: "Do you support membership in the EU and NATO by accepting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"
Nevertheless, Christian Mitskoski, leader of the leading opposition party "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity" (VMRO-PAMNE), said that there will be no vote in the referendum.
As the party spokesman Naum Stoilkovsky explained, Mickkoy decided to refrain from voting in order to express his disagreement with the agreement, which considers "detrimental."
According to the spokesman, the current referendum decides on the renaming of the country and no more than that of the party's strategic goal - to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, President of Macedonia Gheorghe Ivanov refused to participate in the referendum on September 30.
He explained that the name for the country he chose 27 years ago in the referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader considers the renaming of the country as a negative factor.
"A new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being created," Ivanov said.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic - the Republic of North Macedonia - was signed by the Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 this year during a solemn ceremony on the shore of the Lake Prespa, on which the border between the two countries passes.
This treaty should resolve a long-term dispute about the name of the country, as well as Skopje's way to NATO and the EU, reminds TASS.

The U.S. arranges growth of opiates production in Afghanistan
On the sharp aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26, Tehran spoke a lot.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on the Afghan territory, the militants launched a real terrorist war against the state authorities and civilians of the country.
The current year has become a record number of bloody terrorist attacks, as a result of which thousands of ordinary Afghans died," Patrushev said.
The troubles of Afghanistan began not yesterday.
After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, the main enemy of the United States was the al-Qaeda terrorist group (prohibited in Russia), which was planted in Afghanistan.
In less than a month, America and NATO allies started there a military operation "Indestructible Freedom."
17 years have passed.
The many thousand American contingent is now on the Afghan land.
And peaceful life is even more illusive than in then.
The U.S. troops are enraged for the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they are bought from the militants for money - if they were not touched.
The Afghan government controls a smaller part of the country's territory - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - the Taliban movement (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (prohibited in Russia).
But they grow there quickly.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly the one that they did not work in Iraq and Syria.
To all appearances, America is satisfied with this.
It is also like that during 17 years of the American presence the production of drugs (opiats) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
Colossal growth of areas sowed opium poppy and multi-billion profits.
The Macedonians are preparing to vote at a referendum on the accession to the EU and NATO, provided that the name of the country is changed.
The agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on June 17 as the result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize the right to be called Macedonia for its northern neighbor, looking in such a name for an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political analyst: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social changes.
And Greece will consolidate the right to its past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises cannot make absolutely everyone happy."
The ruling social democrats headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev are in favor of renaming the country.
Against the conservative opposition and the president of the country Gheorghe Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is enough to have partnerships with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement, believe that the current socialist government headed by Zaev is imposed from outside to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
It is obvious that there are countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Fay Dulgheri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at the crossroads.
The choice that the Macedonian citizens will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but also for Europe as a whole."
