FANO Russia to hold final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FAS of Russia) together with the Russian Academy of Sciences will hold the third Expert Session "Assessment of the effectiveness of scientific organizations."
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, according to a press-release received by the editorial office of "Lenty.ru."
At the third meeting it is planned to sum up the results of the Expert Session for the year and to form a final list of indicators for assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Separately, the participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of the work of scientific groups, and criteria for the assessments.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events on the formation of a unified approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we succeeded, and the final version of the regulatory documents is in agreement.
Following the results of the nearest session, we should complete the formation of processes of scientometric and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment," - said the head of the expert and analytical department of the Russian Academy of Sciences Elena Aksenova.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than a hundred scientific institutes of Russia.
According to its results, the adoption of the resolution is expected.
The meeting will begin at 10 am Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: the city of Moscow, Solyanka street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to discover related stars
Astrophysics from the University of California at Santa Cruz studied turbulent agitation and its impact on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the opening of specialists will allow to look among the stars related, that is, emerged from the same cluster.
The results of their research were published in Nature magazine, and briefly they can be found on the university website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of the nearby stars is turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas, preceding the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, according to its chemical composition, it is possible to determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of native stars.
Scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from those of relatives in the cluster.
The results of modeling conducted by astrophysics show that such differences should not appear.
In their research specialists with the help of supercomputer modeled two streams of interstellar gas, which together formed a cloud.
This object for several million years under the action of its own gravity is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added paint-marks to the initial gas flows and established that due to the rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud, a high degree of chemical homogeneity is achieved.
According to astrophysics, their research proves that it is possible to look for native star by chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions of education of such objects.

Lavrov: Russia will not "slam the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not "slam the door" in connection with new sanctions.
This was stated today by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
As for our response measures in case of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even argue, fantasize, because everything should be specifically calculated, - he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will be like this time, then we will make decisions on how to respond to it.
This will not be connected with the slamming of the doors, some kind of offenses, falsely understood, - said the minister.
First of all, we will focus on our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and make conclusions from the actions of our partners for their adequacy, agreement and reliability.
According to the steps taken in the field of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what partners seek, - the Russian Foreign Minister continued.
If the whole voice says that "they will be painful for us too, but we are forced to do so to punish Russia," it is probably not very adequate."
As for the WTO, there is no withdrawal from the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions.
On the contrary, we want to actively master the tools of the WTO, including when it comes to trade disputes, - said Lavrov.
We have already used this toolkit to overcome, as we believe, the discriminatory policy of the EU regarding anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of dumping and at the same time used anti-dumping measures against the branches of the Russian economy.
"We are ready to use the WTO mechanisms in order to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the norms of the third EU energy package retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How to use lira in garden design?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since lilac after blooming loses its main attractiveness, it is desirable to plant it together with other shrubs.
It perfectly combines with many cultures.
And next to the lilac can and should be planted as plants, decorative in other terms, and blooming at the same time with it.
Another plus lilac is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a strained tree of different heights, an improved bush, a bush with a wide base and even a kind of garden bonsai - a tree with a bizarrely curved trunk.
Just choose the shape that fits more the design of your garden.

The sentence has also not entered into legal force yet.
The 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish" was celebrated in Arkhangelsk
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was devoted to the first Arctic convoy.
"Dervish" delivered military assistance to the USSR from the United States and Great Britain.
In Arkhangelsk, the meeting of memory was held at the laying stone to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the embankment named after Sedov in Solombal.
The event was attended by representatives of veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the cadet class.
For the first time we gathered twenty-three years ago, when the laying stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who did not return the sea," - said the chairman of the Council of Veterans of Northern Shipping Boris Karpov.
Then the city brass band performed at the event, and pupils of cadet classes presented flowers to veterans and marched with the flags of Russia and the banner of Victory.
The rally ended with laying flowers to the mortgage stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of molded shoes, tin, wool and many other equipment).
In addition, there were also military equipment and weapons on board - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen Harrikin fighters, in disassembled condition.
At the same time, the escort was 16 ships of the British Navy, including two aircraft carriers.
The ship's caravan was not discovered by the enemy and successfully reached its destination - Arkhangelsk.

Remembering the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keit Allison and John Lewis proposed a bill according to which the organization of trade unions is protected as civil law.
"Where the trade unions are, there are middle-class jobs," says Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota, who is the co-chairman of the Congress of the Progressive Faction.
That is why I am proud to present the Act on Enlargement of Workers' Rights along with the symbol of the Civil Rights Movement John Lewis.
This innovative bill will give employees the same legal opportunities in discriminating the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of opponents of the trade unions
Amendment of the Law on Regulation of Labour Relations in such a way as to allow workers facing discrimination for participation in the organization of trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and penalties - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill offer is to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that the trade unions have been subjected to in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - the Americans once supported the countries around the world to adopt, extend and respect labor rights.
There was a time that still remembers millions of Americans when this country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press and the right to organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas McArtur and his assistants helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the paramilitary Hideki Todz so was replaced by democracy.
Being fully aware that the workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that directly admitted that "the right of workers to the organization, to negotiations, and to the collective action is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhauser and his assistants helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that employees will need to be organized and heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations in order to protect and improve labor and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe on this right will not have legal force; measures aimed at these purposes will be recognized as illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission for Human Rights, which compiled the World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948 will be adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the compilers included the guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect his interests."
By the generation of Americans took as a proper basis provision that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and that this trade union participates as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions - should be protected.
Now that these rights are attacked in America, it is wise to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to hear their voices in a free and open society.
As the Venerable Martin Luther King said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the forces of the nation, but increased them.
Raising the living level of millions, trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised a whole nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how it should be.
The official recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the expansion of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - has long been overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis revive the ideals that historically expanded America and made a promise of democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the U.S., the federal judge temporarily blocked the introduction of the law of Louisiana, which his supporters say that he is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by the governor Louisiana Bobby Ginadl in June and was to come into force on September 1, doctors who make abortions would be obliged to have the authority to receive patients in the hospital within a radius of 30 miles from their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that at the moment doctors can continue to make legal abortions, continuing to seek such powers.
"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing their actions to obtain authority," Judge John deGrawells wrote in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled for a month at which the judge will make a more permanent decision according to this law.
The defenders of the right to abortion gladly met this decision, the last in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it will give doctors more time to receive hospital powers.
"Today's decision guarantees that Louisiana women will be protected from an insidious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northap, President and head of the Reproductive Rights Center, who filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the five state clinics.
It was not immediately obvious whether the decision to doctors from two clinics, who did not act as plaintiffs in this case, and also filed an application for the procedure of admission.
Louisiana is part of 11 states that have adopted such laws, and the courts have recently recognized such measures as unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
The key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by the federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion together with the American College of Midwives and Gynecologs and the American Medical Association say that the laws on the authority of admission impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary in terms of medicine.
Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some also noted their positive effect in the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who makes abortions in Louisiana has the authority to receive in the hospital, said the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing this procedure, this doctor, afraid for his safety, would stop performing this procedure, the group said.
Criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said that they will not punish doctors making abortions while their applications for the authority of acceptance are waiting for the decision.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
According to Oleg Nilov, deputy of the State Duma of the Just Russia faction, at least half of the products in each type of goods in the assortment of trade networks should be produced in the assortment of trade networks.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, the newspaper "Izvestia."
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. The retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers according to the rest of the products produced in Russia," Nilov told the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article "On the basics of state regulation of trade activity in the Russian Federation," the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% in the sale of products produced in Russia.
The idea to introduce a 50%-percent quota in trade networks is included in the package of incentive measures for Russian producers.
On the counters will appear several times more domestic goods.
However, the initiative can have both a positive and negative effect, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company "Tax," a member of the independent expert center "Public Duma" Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
The advantage will be agricultural producers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means that the profit will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate to retailers their conditions and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their sales and sales, which will lead to higher taxes than before.
This will increase the budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some more quickly learn, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, however, not immediately," the expert notes.
Earlier, Russian enterprises often could not break through on the shelves of local stores due to high competition from foreign analogues.
Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche is freed and can be breathed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, now there is a "moment of calm," when the previous players have already left, and the new ones have not yet come.
After almost a month, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the growth of prices for finished products," - said AiF.ru the first Vice-President of the All-Russian public organization "Russian Club of Financial Directors," Ph.D. Tamara Kasyanova.
Definitely, the idea to sell at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will allow to consolidate the sector for local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, and not with the goods that, due to subsidies of another country, are cheaper.
In other words, the fight for the buyer will develop between companies operating under the common laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanov notes, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of the internal needs of compatriots under all articles.
And in this situation, trade networks will have to "grow" the share of Russian goods to half of the range.
In this regard, there are increasing fears that low-quality products will be received on the counters.
Perhaps under the guise of produced in Russia will be supplied foreign products with broken labels," the expert adds.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will feel large trading networks, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that in such a situation will suffer and foreign suppliers themselves, as the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods can affect consumers.
The fact is that some products of Russian production may yield to the quality of imported analogues, while stores will be able to inject prices for the second, as a deficit of goods.
The idea of import substitution forgotten in the early 2000s was again discussed by economists in February this year due to the continued devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the background of difficult relations with the West, the issue of abandonment of imported products becomes even more relevant.
The law is designed to oblige retailers in the formation of orders to suppliers to take into account domestic manufacturers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently along the way of import substitution, and the system of planning production for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time," - said the deputy Oleg Nilov.
Particularly effective mechanism of quotas will be for those agricultural sectors, where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really able to completely cover the shelves of Russian stores.
In addition, a powerful impulse can get and meat production.
As is known, the largest share of imports is maintained by beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% still account for Russian products," says Kasyanov.
Experts believe that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will contribute to import substitution and can speed up this process.
However, in itself, this initiative will not lead to import substitution, because this requires a set of measures, I am sure Litvinenko.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be brought from abroad, and therefore, there will be no full import substitution, but significant steps in this direction will be done.
In addition, it is not enough to set quotas, it is necessary to establish production of domestic products in the country in order to fulfill these quotas.
These quotas will provide just such guarantees," the expert states.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of their late mother, who died of ovary cancer in 2007.
Women who are in the countryside of Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers analyzed the maps of the disease of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with "the ovarian cancer" in 2005, discovering that only 35 percent lived five years after the diagnosis was put.
Leading researcher Susan Jordan from the Institute for Medical Research QIMR Berghofer said that the probability of death during the study is 20 percent higher for those who live in the regions and remote areas of the state than those living in urban areas.
NOWIS OF THE RESPOSE: New Medications can slow down lung cancer and ovarian cancer
The researchers traced the medical path of women in seven years.
Doctor Jordan said that the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socioeconomic status also influenced the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer in a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state, the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside cities are more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly in big cities," she said.
Despite the improvement in the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of the distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of services on the road, which will allow specialists to treat women closer to home, and support programs for people undergoing treatment far from their home, can help.
Doctor Jordan said that regardless of geographical position, the study revealed that the long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, emphasizing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer can be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Bank of Elish Niv said that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, the new FAP will open the doors in Kuzhenersky district
The construction of a medical institution in the village of Toktaybelyk was started in April this year and was carried out according to a typical project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Head of Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the medical and preventive institution is almost 230 square meters.
It will provide medical assistance to residents of eight settlements: the villages of Toktabelyak and villages of Dementyevo, Puncheryumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraibelak, Shinur and Chaskaal.
The new medical and obstetrics station will replace the existing FAP, the building of which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet the sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new institution will be opened in the near future.
Killing a four-month-old son in a drunk state, a new-hearted box will appear before the court
A resident of Chuvashia will be on the bench of defendants for killing her own child.
In Cheboksary, the investigation of a criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, charged with inflicting death on negligence, has been completed.
The investigation found that on July 26 this year, the accused, together with a four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birthday of her kuma in Cheboksary.
After a long meal, the Novocheboksar decided to stay in a guest and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up at night and wept, a drunk woman put him next to her bed to feed her breast, but soon slept.
During her sleep, the woman fell on her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, the press service of the SRC in Chuvashia, is sent to court.
Inflation left the holiday.
Will the Russians feel a sharp rise in prices
As a result of cross-sanctions of Russia and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not fit into the forecasts of the authorities, VTB Capital analysts are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed consequences of unsanctions will lead to inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, RBC Daily writes.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year and even less - 6.5%.
However, according to Kommersant, this week the Ministry of Economic Development should make "small but fundamental" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency may lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will eliminate the expected resetting of population income growth.
The forecast assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation are valid for a year - until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be assumed in such a situation?
The current situation assumes a one-time shock, but the downward inflation trend will not change," the source of the newspaper said in the Finance Ministry.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government's financial and economic block on inflation and predict a rise in prices in 2014 at 8%.
The main effect of food bans will come along with the possible introduction in the regions of the Russian Federation of sales tax (NSP) in 2015, experts believe.
Inflation peak of 9% will have to be in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will decline, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflation results after Russia introduced "accurate sanctions."
AIF.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of Analytical Department of FC AForex:
Price growth is already observed in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially significant products began to cherish, the government was forced to launch measures of systemic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unreasonable price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulatory authorities, so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason initiates a rise in prices.
The key factors of the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the enormous rate of capital outflow, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, internal conversion due to the population's flight into foreign currency, as well as the embargo on the import of food products from countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressure remained under control, the cost of the minimum set of products basket would not jump by 12% in just a quarter.
The ban on the import of food products provoked a shock to the supply in the domestic market and led to a completely logical increase in the final value.
Since at the current stage we are unable to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market due to domestic production, the retaliatory sanctions will continue to bear the risks of inflationary component growth.
If we add fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the deteriorated prospects of economic growth, by the end of this year inflation may well exceed 8%.
Alexander Razuvaev, Director of Analytical Department of Alpari
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, in zero it was also above the current level, another thing is that then it was compensated by rapid economic growth.
I think that at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Plato Maguta, asset manager of Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is successfully restrained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, first of all, the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally manifested in the purchases of cash in order to protect their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But the rise in prices begins traditionally after the summer lull and, perhaps, this fall will become more tangible.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia is 7.5%, most likely, as Russia has still financial savings.
Gardening centers are saddened by the decrease in the number of homeowners
Such a decline, due to an exceptional decrease in the number of homeowners less than 35 years, may lead to the fact that gardening centers will lose tens of millions of pounds a year, when today's young consumers have reached the "main age of horticulture," according to a study by HTA, which was reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people renting housing spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that the owners of their own houses spend on horticulture.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting yards in front of the house for parking and reducing the size of the garden as other factors that are threatening the industry, the annual sales of which is estimated to be about 5 billion.
In Bolshoi London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61% to 43 percent in six years, the lowest level of spending on household goods in the UK.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society reported that housing rentals and lack of space for the garden do not mean that people can not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief horticulture adviser at the RHS, said: "The cultivation of plants in containers, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can transport plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of retail trade in horticulture as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year thanks to better weather after unfavorable conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria carried out mass cleaning in the fund "Agriculture"
Three out of four heads of the "Agriculture" foundation were replaced on Friday.
In total, three out of four heads of the "Agrier" fund were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria reported only the dismissal of executive director Atanas Dobrev.
His place was taken by Lozan Vasileva.
It turned out that on Friday, two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were changed quietly.
Deputy Executive Director Tatyana Angelova was released, who until now was responsible for the state assistance and the program of SAPARD, reports BGBNS with reference to the newspaper "Trud."
I did not attend the Board of Management of the Foundation because by law we are not members of the management, but later I was informed that I was released.
I can't say why my dismissal is not reported on the fund's website.
I am on vacation.
I hope I will learn more on Monday," Angelova said.
It will be occupied by Ivanka Bagdatova, who has so far been the head of "Investment lending" in the central fund in the "Agriculture" in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for the fields paid by the EU.
In his place will be appointed Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the Fund "Agreldelie" in the city of Veliko-Tyrnovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the Foundation Atija Aliyeva-Veli retained her post.
She is currently in charge of the Rural Development Program.
The official reasons for all the changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey calls an American diplomat in connection with the report on espionage
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey called the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on the American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that the American attorney in affairs and Turkish officials discussed the message on Monday.
German magazine "Der Spiegel" and Internet magazine "The Intercept" reported that the documents provided by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence facility for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has reduced the importance of this message, saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
Earlier reported that the main German intelligence agency also made Ankara a target of intelligence, caused a more angry response from the Turkish government.
The largest Chinese companies are united against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including the largest commercial real estate developer in China Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networks, messengers, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), create a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
However, it will be difficult to catch up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which left behind even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com.
The Union of the Largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($ 814 million), 70% of it will own Wanda and 15% - each of the Internet companies, the Wanda Group said.
It is planned to register the company in Hong Kong.
The JV will combine Baidu's search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, the number of users of which is about 438 million people), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, the Wanda Group manages at least 49 commercial properties across China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $ 8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and theme park in Qindao (a city in eastern China on the shores of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate profits of $ 960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American network of cinemas AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its own shopping centers, hotels and entertainment places with e-commerce services, the development of which will be just created by the competitor Alibaba.
According to Dong Ce, who will lead the new company, thanks to the merger Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its services e-commerce from the current 40 million to 100 million by the next year.
The new site should become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, notes Dun Ce.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers on the Internet so that they come to ordinary offline stores or buy other traditional services.
The classic example of O2O are coupons sales services such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest "pierre" in online commerce," said Wang Jianlin, head of Wanda (Bloomberg quote).
"Now there is no real platform O2O in China, and in this situation, the chances are approximately equal," he said.
The Chinese Internet trading market is the largest in the world, and, according to McKinsey &amp; Co., its volume will increase more than three times by 2015 compared to 2011 to $ 395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, Bloomberg reports official statistics: it is more than the population of any country in the world, except for India.
And according to forecasts, by 2015 this number may grow to 850 million people.
The richest union
The head of Tencent Ma Huathen until recently was the richest man in China, however, according to the millionaires index of the agency Bloomberg, the founder of Alibaba Jack Ma has already surpassed it by $ 5.5 billion.
The state of Jack Ma is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $ 11 billion is his share in Alibaba.
The head of Baidu Robin Lee now ranks third among the richest people in China, while Wang Jianlin from Wanda - the fourth line of the ranking.
"It is very interesting to observe this battle: the three richest people join forces to challenge an even richer," said Bloomberg Director of the Chinese Ecommerce Research Center in Hangzhou Cao Lai.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba immediately after the creation: "Rome can not be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not so easy to compete not only for new companies, but also to the honored leaders of the world Internet trading, is evidenced by the yesterday's report on the financial performance of Alibaba for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as something between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profit for the period almost twice exceeds the same total figure of competitors - it grew almost three times year-on-year and amounted to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has a huge potential for generating money, largely due to its mobile applications," - commented Bloomberg analyst from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba prospectus on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July amounted to 188 million, which is significantly higher than the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter accounted for mobile devices.
Alibaba has to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company may be estimated at $187bn after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may take place on September 16.
The road-show of the company, preceding this event, starts on September 3.
It is expected that Alibaba's release at the IPO will be a record in the history of NYSE and will allow the company to attract about $ 20 billion.
So far, the record for the amount of funds attracted on the US exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 held the initial placement of its shares, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of food products in trade networks should be Russian-made, according to Duma deputies.
They have developed a draft law on the given issue.
We are talking about making changes to the art. 8 Federal Law "On the basics of state regulation of trade activity in the Russian Federation" and in the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, not less than 50 percent of domestic products in stores should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in the winter, so they will be made a "discount" to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% in the sale of all food products, the country of origin of which is Russia, the newspaper "Izvestia."
On August 27, a draft law on amendments to the Federal Law "On Retail Markets" was introduced to the lower house of the parliament, which proposes to revive in Russia farmer markets, in which small producers will be able to sell their products.
Police Chief Magalouf accused of corruption
The claimants presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the State Prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The head of the Kalvia police on the resort island of Mallorca was arrested as a result of accusations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the scandalous center of unbridled drunkenness Magalufe.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was put in custody as a result of accusations of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, the streets on which the majority of bars and nightclubs of Magalouf.
According to the daily online publication Mallorca Diario, the claimants presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Kalvia to the office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca against corruption on Friday.
Two more local policemen were arrested by the Guards of the Spanish National Guard in connection with the accusations of corruption and will be interrogated by the judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish daily edition of ABC reported that dissatisfied owners of nightclubs say that protectionism by the authorities seriously affects the state of their business.
"We are no longer talking about making money, we are talking about how to survive," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Our sources of existence cannot be jeopardized.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf got into the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular video on YouTube, which was shown 18-year-old British vacationer, who made a blowjob to 24 men during the race on bars.
The authorities of the island since then are trying to stop hooliganism in a drunken state among the rest of Magalouf, minimizing the number of scandalously known alcohol races on bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the incident with the blowjob occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage bars together were fined €55000 ($73000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular among young British holidaymakers, was also a place of numerous accidents in a state of alcoholic intoxication associated with crazy fun, known as "balconying," when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked with wet and windy conditions that influenced flights to Adelaide Airport
The SNS has prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that influenced flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm rain fell on the city in the evening at 9 pm, followed by 6.6 mm, which fell out during the night of Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a pair of short showers with gusty winds, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 pm and poured out almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter issued an early spring portion last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8C in the city.
The squallous conditions are supposed to be one of the reasons for delay in landing Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane had to land on schedule immediately after 7:30 pm, but hit the wind shift zone - a sudden change in speed or wind direction at a short distance - and was forced to gain height.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
These flights showed that the plane had to gain height during the second landing, and the plane, in the end, landed about 8:40 pm.
The delay in this flight caused a delay in several other flights, including Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is predicted in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two showers.
Calculation of estimates of construction facilities in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
The Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems of connection to the grid.
Under the Federal Antimonopoly Service, an expert council for the development of competition in the construction sector was established.
At his meeting, the head of the control of housing and communal services, construction and natural resources of the Federal Antimonopoly Service Vadim Soloviev said that "today's calculation of the estimate of construction facilities is absolutely incomprehensible."
The regulatory base makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unreasonable price of construction, according to the FAS.
And offer the cost of construction of objects of state property at the stage of designing to determine on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of the current estimate norms and single prices for technological operations.
These proposals are included in the "road map" and are now under consideration in the Ministry of Construction.
"The replacement of the traditional estimate documentation in the construction for calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry, - explained "RGB" Vadim Soloviev.
After all, now the estimates calculate every bolt and nut, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation unscrupulous construction companies can dig "whole tractors."
In the Minstroe agree with the FAS.
"The first work on the transition to the cost calculation on structural elements is already there: methods for calculating prices for constructive solutions, drawing up estimates on these indicators, - said "RGB" head of the Department of Urban Planning and Architecture of the Ministry of Construction Elena Zhukova.
The road construction sector has been chosen as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demianko said, the estimate standards have long been outdated, but another mechanism has not been proposed to the business.
"As for the proposed calculations on structural elements, in practice, it is difficult to implement, as in the construction of buildings are often used completely different technologies," he said.
It is no secret that the construction market develops largely due to the state order.
According to Ekaterina Lezina, Chairman of the Board of NP "Expert Community of State Order Professionals," today the state is the most solvent customer.
Deputy Director for Engineering of the Sectoral Center for Capital Construction Rosatom Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that today the market is conventionally divided into companies that have access to the portfolio of contracts, and to companies that own monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors to this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts will be maximally protected from someone's management impact.
The expert council proposed to form a system of state order in such a way that the same performer is not entitled to receive more than one contract in the amount of more than 1 billion rubles. or several contracts worth more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry of Defense believes that this approach should be assessed in terms of influence on business, as well as the efficiency of construction management.
As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case it will be necessary to give the customer the functions of the general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the staffing number of the customer and budget expenditures for its maintenance.
At the same time, the specialists of the customer will have to have knowledge to assess the quality of the works performed by contractors, as well as their safety.
Often with such a breakdown it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of the object as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly qualified participants in public procurement due to the lack of interest in obtaining a state order for incomplete work and a small amount of the contract.
Alexander Evstashenkov, deputy head of the Expert Consulting Center of the Procurement Institute, believes that now the procedure of the state order has become a business game for the attention of the contractor.
And he cited the following example: "the participant when filling in the application must indicate "specific indicators" without the indication of the words: "or equivalent," "should be," "from," "better," "less," "neagrogue," "similar," "similar to," "not lower," "be higher," "may," "may," "may," "be," "be," "previously," "not earlier," "not above."
Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of the application submitted by contractors.
Another problem of the 44-FZ, according to Yevstashenkov, was the need to assess at the stage of filing the quality of work through the "paper" proposal of the participant.
Considering the application of the participant, you can really assess only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, which have not even started, - the expert believes.
The quality of the work can be evaluated only when they receive.
The expert council also proposed to transfer marginal income from the upper to the lower echelon to the lower echelon to the intermediate contractors.
Chairman of the Expert Council, State Secretary, deputy head of the Federal Antimonopoly Service Andrei Tsarikovsky believes that this should not be done, as the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it will turn out, as in the well-known reprise of Arkady Raikin "Atele": "There are claims to buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after war in Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after they spent the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mines rain fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed during the territory being restored after the hostilities.
The beginning of school classes brought a feeling of joy and excitement to the settlements of southern Israel, but the traces of hostilities remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which hit a rocket, removed the traces of splinters from the walls and children's slides before the students came.
"We're a little afraid, but we're happy to look into the future," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibuca Saad, and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shany Bart, said that suddenly she was going to school "a little bit strange."
"There was a difficult time, and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz, which is located near the border with Gaza to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement stopped the war last week, thousands of people in border settlements, such as Saad, did not go out to the street or left their homes, leaving for safer areas further from the Gaza Strip to escape from the missile and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nakhal Oz, settlements near the border with Gaza, where a fragment of the Palestinian mine was killed by a 4-year-old boy, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza, which strongly committed from the Palestinian fire.
He advised children to learn diligently and said, "We will do our best to give you knowledge and ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to a perpetual truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to the hostilities, but the key issues remained unresolved, for example, Hamas's demand to remove the Egyp-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and sea ports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down his arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
It is expected that the new stage of indirect negotiations will begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, including three-quarters of civilians, and at least 494 children, according to the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, he did not provide substantial evidence confirming this statement.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the hostilities, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4591 units of missiles and mines across Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of houses in the Gaza Strip were damaged and destroyed, and 250,000 people found refuge in more than 100 schools, which were transformed into shelters.
Due to the fact that tens of thousands of people were still in shelters, and the fights continued, the officials responsible for education, last week the beginning of the school year was postponed.
"I hope that the school will soon open so that we can complete our education, as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of the schools of Gaza.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices showed the greatest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index for housing prices in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, reported RP data on Monday.
This increase led to a cumulative increase in June, July and August by 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual rise in prices amounted to 10.9 percent, more than twice the growth in 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless said that Sydney and Melbourne are leading a two-level market.
The figures of RP Data show that housing prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent over the last year, while in Melbourne - by 11.7 percent.
The next in power were Adelaide, Brisbein and Darwin, where prices on average rose from five to six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, on which government spending cuts, where prices rose by just 1.4 percent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that now, when spring began, there will be an increase in the number of real estate exhibited for sale, over the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Taking into account the current high level of auction sales speed, the total high sales speed and current conditions with a low interest rate, it is likely that the cost of housing will grow in the next three months," he said.
How people live in Ufa's oldest home
In the former house of gold producers and mining companies Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (former Bolshaya Kazanskaya) 18 apartments.
The house of the XVIII century since the construction has not changed, except for the decrepitness.
Foreign people go here as on a tour, and tenants suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufa house, the walls of which remember the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of the building of the house is inaccurate, historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737 years.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is no small 300 years.
The old courtyard, always open door, creaking staircase.
The doors of the apartments are located close to each other, the walls cracked, and in some places the street is visible to the gap from the bleached plaster.
Everything seems to be kept on an honest word.
And the locals say: "You don't think it's true."
It is very difficult to live in a wooden house of the XVIII century, - says Tatiana Lukyanova, a resident of the apartment No 3.
The object is on state protection, but the money for its maintenance is not allocated for tens of years, and we feel like museum exhibits, which the authorities just forgot.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls still hold badly, but the foundation is rotten.
Many tenants still go to the toilet on the street, and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be satisfied in such conditions?!
The road passes directly under the windows, even there is no pedestrian zone.
Tatiana pushes the curtain away.
Now you can see what was only heard before: under the windows is a stream of cars.
You see, the glass is slumbered constantly, we can not open the windows, and the noise is used to.
Man gets used to everything, to good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thank you to her husband, his hands are gold.
Moreover, we have two rooms, we live three with my son.
And other families have conditions much worse, on the second floor in general, the ceiling is just over one and a half meters high.
For contrast Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Starostinaya.
A nice hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile tells:
We have a studio apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live: my husband and daughter with a granddaughter.
I have never been here since I was born, and there was never another living space." Lyudmila walks around the room: mezzanine, two sofas with the letter "g"; one of them was a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical."
But from the ceiling regularly flows: the water supply system is not suitable anywhere.
Lyudmila speaks of her apartment everyday and surprisingly at the same time, as an Italian, whose house stands on the Roman ruins.
That is, it leads into one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water supply was carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
At the same time they made us a small kitchen in a cut and a toilet of the former closet.
We live just where Demidov and his family lived, on the second floor lived servants.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
In the Real Estate Center Ufa they say that privatization does not matter.
All the same, we will get only a one-room apartment, we can not claim more.
Already four months ago they promised to settle us, but no further promises went.
I am not used to complaining and I will not.
In this apartment (room!) A whole dynasty lived: my grandmother and grandfather, mom and dad, I and my daughter and my daughter with my granddaughter.
Everybody has been in this time.
For example, healthy rats ran around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the lid, they are a meter thickness!
They say the solution was mixed on the eggs, so it lasts for so long.
The house is built thoroughly, thank you Demidov!
Probably only that is why no one has yet killed the collapsed ceiling or piles.
Only the building still slowly dies in front of us: the boards and logs of the house rot, the floors have repeatedly collapsed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes to the ground, like a well.
They say, so there is - under our room secret climb and the move to the river Belaya, which specially made once lived here Old Belovers, so that you can hide from danger, in case of what.
They were persecuted.
Lyudmila Starostin tells us how some historian came to them, begged to let him start in the apartment of excavation.
And then he persuaded them to give them a living space in exchange for his single on the Avenue of October.
Ludmila refused the historian:
Where are we four in a single?
And here, at least tiny hope, that will give housing more spacious.
Agree to the exchange, nothing would be won.
However, the old-fashioned family did not win anything.
Lyudmila's biggest dream to settle them, and her daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families allocated a two-room apartment instead of not the most majestic ruins, in which two generations live now.
Cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakov from apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There are two tight rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, her big family lives.
We are seven men, two children.
You yourself see what conditions.
The plaster falls off in pieces, as well as window frames, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms through holes.
The water in the tap all year round is only cold.
Going through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can make sure that the most fortunate spouses Lavrentiev from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.
You're right, spaces a lot!
The room is 75 squares, three people are registered.
We live just in those rooms where according to legend Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentiev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One is bad - everything around the seams cracks, falls apart, collapses.
The neighbors, probably, have already told!
Most of the torment we have with the floors: wooden boards were rotten, the land literally left underneath.
I put up-ups, wedges; there's nothing else in the hall, and in another room we swing, we swing so much, so shaking.
About the house of merchant Evdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrievich can tell better than any guide.
The gold industry treats as a native, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the person was extraordinary: the owner of Kaginsky and Uzyansky factories built houses, cast off guns and bells, kept Ural mines.
The heirs of merchant real estate are proud of the ancestor, but they no longer want to live under one roof with history.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the XX century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden rooms for carriages, stables and guardhouses, subsequently demolished.
In 1968, we wanted to remove our house, but something prevented...
The story repeated in 2014: again lured new housing.
As a team, we collected all the documents, ran the necessary authorities, and suddenly learned that moving to the apartments is transferred to 2015 or 2016.
Something we don't believe in all this...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
Officials of the tenant did not accept.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, they issued a piece of paper without signature and a seal: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the settlement of tenants."
I even have such a feeling that our house has long been gone in terms of the city, because first it was numbered 57, then became 57 A, and now 57/1.
As if it had already been demolished in the 70s.
The "Russian Planet" appealed to the head of the sector of information and analytical work of the management of land resources of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of settlement of dilapidated housing.
I can not be responsible for the actions of officials of the 70s, only I know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the ancient houses on the street of the October Revolution, which are architectural value - is successfully carried out.
Residents are planned to settle in new apartments in the near future.
According to Barabash, the restoration of the Demidov House will be Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Now in Italy is an architectural biennale, and the project "Old Ufa" is represented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 all the former Staraya Kazanskaya Street will be restored, - the official says.
Houses will acquire the proper form, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to become a museum open to all comers.
In addition, at the government level it was decided to make the street on weekends pedestrian.
On weekdays, unfortunately, it will not work too much traffic in the city.
Vladimir Barabash promises to settle people from the future museum in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the present ones.
Only from another epoch.
In Primorye, a forest fire began due to a thunderstorm
Dry thunderstorm was the cause of a forest fire in the territory of Hunting district forestry in Pozharsky district of Primorsky Krai.
At the site of the fire, a group of forces and means is being increased.
According to the management of the KSBU "Seaside Air Base," the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Chief of the Air Base:
The fire, which arose in a hard-to-reach area, found an observer pilot from the board of an An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
Wood remains are lit on the old highland.
Strong cluttering of the territory and steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the absence of suitable landing paratroopers-fire sites create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
The Mi-8 helicopter is needed.
The delivery of forces at the disposal of the Mi-2 air base and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was found at the place of extinguishing, 4 firefighters were quickly planted.
The main task of specialists is fire extinguishing and preparing a site for the delivery of additional forces and fire extinguishing means.
In the area of lunch in the area of the village Hunting helicopter additionally delivered 3 paratroopers-firefighters.
As soon as the site for landing the helicopter in the area of the fire will be ready, experts will be moved to the place of extinguishing, the website of the Administration of the Primorsky Krai reports.
Lenny Henry: My father never embraced me.
Never said, "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children born in a family of immigrants from Jamaica to Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in the factory, and their relations were limited.
Henry rehearsing the comedy, "Rare Records of Rudi," which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew from a series of programs on Radio 4.
Soundtrack - a mixture of raggi and rap, and melodies - cheerful.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother's death, there was a "many" treatment, besides, Henry often reflects on the relationship with his father.
It was very inaccessible.
You have never seen his face, you only heard his voice: "Stop making noise.
Leave the sister.
Was gone!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults, when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a screaming blow.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an unsmiling guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Recently Henry opened the foundry workshop in Dudley, and although the conditions became better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at what his life must have been.
Now there is a little better, but these are dark, smoky, the depths of the labyrinths of the hell with flashes of fire and smoke and a heap of soot.
My father crawled into the bath and just lay there, and you heard him slowly singing to himself, because he wanted to wash off the foundry workshop.
When I came there, I realized that he did these years and years to make us a food and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry left childhood deprived of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when my mother became ill at the very end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love he lacked in his childhood.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don Frank.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom
They are still excellent friends with Frank, on which he was married 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She is a great mother.
Henry's mother himself had diabetes.
He was one of what killed her.
So, when I got very much, I got very well and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
Then I started serious phytens, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
The change of Henry's career trajectory is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-cut beard.
Since he received the recognition of critics for his Othello, he has completely plunged into the theater.
The "Comedy of Errors" followed, and then the "Fences" of Ogast Wilson.
This work differs from sitcoms and comedies, which were an incomprehensible attribute of his rich professional life.
He began his career when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed how he parodies on stage, and wrote about him in the "New Faces."
His career on television began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time I was the only black parody/comic on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective machine for the delivery of jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in the "New Faces" in 1975
Since his manager had the right to "Black and White Shows of Hands," an easy entertainment program in which people "injored their faces," Henry found that he has been playing in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I like, I don't want it to be with me, but I don't regretting it was doing.
Although it was a strange, worthy condemnation position, I worked on large sites and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "the award-winning easy entertainment classics on British television years and years" was "a stunted parody on black people."
Representing the characters who mocked the culture of blacks in the UK, and sang it, Henry worked in an alternative comedy project in the eighties.
The first season of Lenny Henry's Show was broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, by the chef Gairet Blacklock from the comedy series "Shef!."
Advertising videos, documentaries, TV series and roles in cinema took the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series in 2008 "LennyHenry.tv," he thought: "What you're going to do next, Lena, because it seems a little that you're pulling time or slowly turning aside."
Next was a series of documentary programs on Radio 4 called "What's Good in...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
I can't say that I was really taught at school, and I thought it was, in many ways, a prerogative of middle-class white people with tights and cabbage at the bottom of the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
All we have interviewed for the program, Peter Hall, Trevor Nan, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said: "You have to try.
Don't scold it until you know what you're talking about.
Arrify some of these words aloud and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from the last monologue of Othello for documentary transmission, and it caught.
I had a feeling that I could do it.
As if my head was straightened.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn your text, and have a little research.
So, the process of rehearsals was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it.
And she was a success.
They seemed to have been waiting for a catastrophe, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started the "Failures Comedy."
Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his business was to entertain the public.
"A quiet voice inside me said, "You will have to work for 10 minutes while they are repairing the computer."
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the performance would resume as soon as the problem was solved.
I left the scene and said something in me, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my duty.
I can let someone else understand it.
"You play in the play, stay in the role."
Henry in the "Fences" at the theater Daces
It was difficult to learn the text for the "Fences."
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens muscles.
She also accepted well, so it was like a sign from above, showing, "This is what you need to do."
He says this, of course, in a voice.
So I'm holding on to that.
I really love it.
I love to be in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the thinking of a comic - all the way our conversation interrupts the outbreaks of his humor, when he begins, then finishes parody.
I just decided not to work in the stand, because this thing with obtaining instant reward from the full room of strangers, I think, is quite dangerous.
If you all the time aspire to it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work in "Direct Ether in Apollo" when I want, but basically I do not get such pleasure as before.
I ask if he will give a tour of the standup someday.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps to give shape to the beginning, middle and end of the path - I do not think that I will ever want to give up.
So is it his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's a pleasant fun.
You always tell some story, and here is a great place for it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify "invisibility workers"
Kenya began biometric registration of all civil servants in an attempt to remove "invisibility workers" from the government's payment statement.
Employees who are not registered in the next two weeks will no longer pay, the government statement reads.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after they left the state service.
President Ukhura Keniat promised to reduce corruption in state structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (about 700000) per month is lost due to payments to "invisibility workers" and other financial violations.
The government suspects that salaries continue to come to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the state service, BBC reporter Vanyama Cebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants must come to the identification centers within the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, the government statement reads.
Anyone who does not do this without a good reason, will be erased from the bill of payment, it is reported.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the public service, defining the actual number of civil servants, and will also be used to clear the bill of payment at both levels of the government - hence, put an end to the problem of "invisibility workers," said Ann Vaigur, secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Planning and structuring of power.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested in connection with a "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," local news agencies reported.
Police representatives did not immediately comment on the given information.
Among the detainees were 14 senior officers, according to Hurriet Daley News.
Some of them participated last December in measures to identify corruption, which was aimed at checking the employees of the government, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish policemen were arrested on suspicion of creating an organized criminal group and listening to the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who at that time was Prime Minister) identified their actions as part of the measures taken against him and other, standing in power, Islamic clergenic Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine again opened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told the journalists who were expecting that not all schools were re-opened, but that he would do everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
The ceremony took place on September 1 not at every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful sky.
All Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian popular front, must fight for the peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, director of the school in Slavyansk, where Yatsenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future life.
The first day of study is traditionally noted by the fact that children wear embroidered shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, perhaps she found such an impressive leader she needed
It is followed by a train of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal circles of Tori party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began in the consulting firm on the global management of Bain and Co, and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and in the world of media in Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning, when a high position in the head company Pearson's took a fellow-man, who held a lower position.
It is said that her earnings are approaching about 1 million.
Its political rating is also prone.
She was recommended by David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP when he tried to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became adviser to the Cabinet.
Her husband was former adviser to Tory.
Earlier in May, I called the work of the chairman of the poisoned cup.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life, but in its structure there is an internal paradox.
The Board has two directions: inside as the top level of the BBC's management hierarchy itself, but also out of the way as a voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopo, which requires a complete radical reform.
However, what new president will risk to come, tramping and destroying the institution as difficult as the Chinese dynasty, if he deprives himself of work in this process.
This is a difficult solution.
It would not be so difficult, many people will be happy to see how the BBC will be reduced in size - after the revision of its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, the inevitable negotiations on the cost of the license pose a special danger to the BBC.
For a modest amount of 145.50 per year, the British acquire a share of, certainly, the greatest media enterprise in the world.
BBC tells a good story: she says that the results of her work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them only 40p per day.
Moreover, it is obvious that the popularity of Beeb is growing: 53 percent support it today against 31 percent 10 years ago.
Models of BBC viewing and use have changed: now I get news headlines on the mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive president - I hope it has found him.
Perry from Texas says that the humiliating tweet was written by someone outsider
On Sunday evening, the Twitter account of the governor of Texas, Rick Perry, contained an insulting image of the district prosecutor from the Democrats, who is at the center of criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was deleted later, followed by another one from Perry's account, in which the record was disenacted.
I just had a tweet published from my account, which was written by someone outsiders.
"I don't approve of this tweet and I've removed it," reports a later post.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to the messages asking to comment.
Although the records were uploaded from the confirmed account of Perry, it was unclear who actually was publishing in this tape.
The earlier tweet contained an unrelenting caricature for the prosecutor of Travis County Rosemary Lemberg, who found guilty of driving in a state of intoxication in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on the funding of her agency when she refused to resign, which led to the trial of a large jury in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate for the 2016 elections.
The signature in the tv says: "I do not always drive the car in a state of intoxication, 3 times higher than the allowable level of alcohol in the blood.. But when I do this, I accuse Governor Perry of saying that he tells me about it."
I am the most drunken democrat in Texas.
Lemberg did not investigate the participation of a large jury against Perry.
They were dealt with by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry did not plead guilty and described the accusations as a political trick.
His powerful legal team asked the judge, who was conducting this case, to reject the indictment, stating that the law, which is used to persecute the governor, who performs his duties for the longest history of Texas, will be vague, which is contrary to the constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from the state's funds to the State Public Control Department, which is based in Travis County and is engaged in harassment of corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
The Veto raised an official complaint by a group of public controls, which has left-wing views.
The tape of the confirmed account of Perry is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
When Perry came fifth at the party's congress in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012, Perry responded to rumors that he could get out of the game by publishing a tweet with a photo running near the lake, and the words: "Here are we, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to the "normal state"
One of the most famous developers of London warned that the real estate market in South-Eastern England "returned" to the normal level of activity.
Houses in the capital were the subject of lively demand and rapidly growing prices, while the fears that the credit bubble would push Bank of England to establish restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidley, founder and chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of this fiscal year, the market has returned to a normal level of transactions from the peak of 2013, adding that it provided a "stable working environment."
The London real estate market succeeded during the decline, as foreign buyers came to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped by 18.5 percent in just last year, according to the Land Cadastre, significantly overtaking the average of 6.7 percent in England and Wales in general.
The average market prices for private, affordable and student schemes Berkeley rose by about one-fifth last year, reaching about 423000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive for foreign buyers, some of which also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around the potential "tax on mansions" before the general elections next May.
Last week, the London real estate agency Foxtons warned that the April reform of the mortgage market, which introduced more stringent conditions for the provision of loans, will also result in a decrease in the market growth of both real estate purchase and sale transactions and prices in the second half of the year.
On Monday, the latest data from Bank of England showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced its forecast of London real estate prices for 2015 to 3% on the basis of the fact that the mood of real estate prices has already begun to weaken.
In the meantime, the volume of transactions fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfur and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, the demand for houses in the capital was very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales worth more than 2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgeley added: "Ask for the desired product with good design and the best location remained the same and, reflecting this, sales for the period remained preserved."
In June, the company announced that it sold 3,742 new houses this year until the end of April - almost a third more than in the 2007 pre-crisis peak.
The annual profit before taxes rose by 40 percent compared to the previous year to about 380 million, income - by 18 percent to about 1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pijli said that Berkeley's estimated revenues for this year will meet the current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, it is expected to profit for the whole year before the payment of taxes of about 450 million.
The value of Berkeley shares was kept at about 23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Photos of nude Jennifer Lawrence published online by hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th ceremony of awarding the annual American Film Academy Prize.
Photos of naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar award, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who assures that he has a "catalogue" of photos of another 100 ascending stars.
The representative of the star of the "Hunger Games" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence are real, and condemned the hacker for "a blatant invasion of private space."
An appeal has been filed with law enforcement agencies and they will be persecuted by anyone who will publish stolen photos by Jennifer Lawrence.
Photos that were originally posted on the 4chan photo sharing site were allegedly obtained due to the lack of Apple's online protection system Apple iCloud, and the alleged "catalogue" of the victims of hacking includes the names of a dozen women celebrity, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is not clear how many of these photos are genuine, although the star "Scotta Pilgrim vs. All" Winstead on Twitter also condemned the breach.
"Those who look at the photos we've done with my husband a few years ago, being alone at home - I hope you are proud of yourself," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis from the series Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victoria-winner" denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These so-called photos of the naked me FALSHIVKI, the people.
Let me stop it in the germ. *kalambur intentional*.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of the pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos, on which, presumably, she is genuine.
Exclusive excerpt from the new novel by Howard Jacobson about love and letter "J," which caused the praise of critics
They were dissolved, it was best to say that, they gradually collapsed like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
It was only occasionally that a woman told him that he was too serious, heavy in communication, tense, closed, and perhaps a little irritable.
And then she squeezed his hand.
He saw irritability in himself.
He was thorny like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this thorny was a small novel, from which he expected more than usual, getting rid of lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eylinn Solomonz was a tremblingly fragile beauty with slashed hair and a trembling heart from the northern island village, even more distant and harsh than Port Royben.
She came south with her companion older than herself, whom Kevern considered her aunt, while the latter inherited the house in a damp but like a paradise valley under the joyful name "Paint Valley."
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes flowed, spiders sat motionless in the baths, the slugs left their traces on all the windows, confident that the house belongs to them; the garden is overgrown with weeds, like giant cabbage kittens.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, at the same time frightening and fascinating, with full secrets of the garden.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in the long list of the Booker Prize in 2014.
Shortlist to be announced next week
Kevern and Eylinn sat, holding hands, in broken deckchunds in the midst of the high grass, enjoying unexpectedly warm spring day; they both dispersedly joined the cheap console, which provided the country with a prumping music and calming news, when, looking at her crossed brown legs, he remembered the old song of the black-and-old forged, his father loved the black house.
You have too big legs.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, the songs of this type in the console no longer lost.
They were not banned - nothing was banned - they simply did not lose.
They were helped to become archaic as the word "archaic."
The public taste did something that would never have been achieved by orders and regulations, and just as among the books people chose memoirs of rich people who grew up in poverty, culinary books and love novels, from all music they chose ballads.
Worried that day, Keverne began to play on an imaginary piano and a rough comic voice to sing Eylinn's big legs.
Eilenn didn't understand.
"It was a popular song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he told her, automatically pins of two fingers.
That's how his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she floats from his lips.
It started with the game they played when it was small.
His father played in her with his father, as he told him.
Start the word with "J," forget to put two fingers in your mouth - and it will cost you a penny.
It was not a very fun game then, and it wasn't a lot of fun now.
He knew he was expecting that from him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eylinn had never heard him.
Jazz was not played either, although it was not openly banned.
Improvisation came out of fashion.
There is only one "if" in life.
When the melody began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
With wit the same way.
His unpredictability acted on the nerves of people.
And jazz was a wit, expressed with the help of music.
Although he reached the age of 10 years, never hearing about Sammy Davis Junior, Keverne knew about jazz from the paternal semi-secret CDs.
But at least he didn't have to say Eilin that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
The society was obedient, and this meant that each of its segments agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those who were protected by fate - with the principle of group predisposition.
People of African-Caribbean origin in temperament and physical characteristics were well suited for the field of entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
Immigrants from the Indostana, as if from nature talented in everything related to electronics, took up that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What remained of the Polish diaspora was engaged in plumbing; what remained of the Greek, was hit by plates.
Coming from the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country when TO, WHAT PROCESSOR, THE UPDING PROCTION OF PROCISCHIL occurred, in fear that they would be accused of incitement to flames, in fear, in fact, that the flame would swallow them next, opened restaurants with lab and hookahs, were not brought out.
Everyone is in capacity.
Since she had only heard ballads before, Eylinn was hard to understand how insulting words that Keverne had just sang to her, could have been put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They are not really insulting," said Keverne.
Is that, perhaps, for people who have big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he adored the song.
He said too much, but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of security.
No word could penetrate through the soundproofing of giant leaves, similar to cabbage.
Eilenn still did not understand.
How could your father love this?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to press two fingers to her lips again.
She had already considered him strange.
"It seemed ridiculous to him," he said instead.
She shook her head incredibly, closing the Kevernah's review.
In the whole world there was nothing but a dug of her and her black hair.
Nothing he would like to look at.
"Well, if you say so," she said, staying in her opinion.
But that doesn't explain why you're eating it to me.
It seemed to be really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
I can't say, no.
Loans, maybe a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"You like me just because you have thick ankles," he tried to say instead.
I have such perversion.
It sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be ridiculous.
Attempts to joke often led him to embarrassing situations, because, like his father, he lacked the calming clarity that could soften the cruelty that had been crouching in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Keverne, wanted.
Despite the good eyes.
Eylinn Solomonz blushed and got up from the sunset, overthrowing the console and the strait of the wine they drank.
Wine from elderberry, so that intoxication could not justify him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you just because you have a dull head," she said...
Although you do not like it.
He was sorry for her because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she gave him a rebuff.
Did she think he would hit her?
She did not talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that in the main features she was like the local.
The same huge icy ocean struck both of them.
The same confused men, even more sensitive and capricious after the THAT, WHAT PROCIL, THE UPDING PROCISLE OF PROCISLE than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered in fury from the pub into a pub, ready to raise their hand to any woman who dared to deny them or to tease them.
A dull head?
They would have shown her a dull fist if she hadn't been careful!
First, they would kiss - the kiss now became the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote from fresh ballads, which gave the console - first kiss her, and then hit her.
The too much clarification, in Kevern's opinion, because the kiss itself was already a hooliganism.
Eylinn Solomons showed that he had to leave.
He got up from the deckchair like an old man.
She felt the lead heaviness herself, but his weight surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him go, and from the top window she watched him go, her companion - a man who himself had taken the burdens.
Adam, who leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a pampering with him and men at all, though some of them raised their hand on her.
The man who turned away from her, with a bent back, shamed, fought, all the ability to fight left him - why did she think that she knew it so well if she could not remember a single case, until today, when she would see such a thing?
Again Eilenn Solomonz looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or about that Esme Nusbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked in the "Ofnau," the informal public mood control service, prepared a small report on the preservation of low and medium-sized levels of violence in those parts of the country where it was expected to be reduced, if not completely, given the means and forces that were allocated for its rapidity.
"Many things have been done, and much is being done," she wrote, "to soften the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these tangled branches and narrow secessions of the area, where, despite the growing over the hedges, the gentle breath of human kindness was rarely felt in history.
However, some qualities are ineradicable.
The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions that it generates.
The population sheds tears over the sentimental ballads, swallows stories of overcoming obstacles and announces its ardent faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness preserves its strong grip both in rural communities and urban settlements, but there is also data that a new and malicious raid on the roads and on the roads, even on the roads and on the ground.
"You have an annoying habit of writing too much," said its supervisor, reading the report entirely.
I think you should read less novels.
The Dussbaum's Esme lowered her head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I'm going to be responsible," said Esme Nusbaum.
Are you lesbian?
The Esme again insisted on her right to private life and silence.
Feminist?
Again silence.
"I ask," Luther Rabinovitz finally said, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
Here we have no prejudices.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and commendable by themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as those that you have shown me.
Obviously you are prejudiced against the church, and what you call "violent" and "rough," others would interpret as an expression of natural love of life and energy.
To continue to nudecase about THAT, WHAT PROCISLE, THE THIRD PROCESS, as if it had happened, if it happened at all, yesterday, it means depriving the country of vitality.
Esme Nusbaum looked around while Rabinovitz was talking.
Behind his head pink, like flamingos, LED letters repeated the tips that "Ofnau" gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.
Smiling to your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
The conversation is better than silence, the word of the song is better than the word written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you want to say," said Esme Nusbaum quietly, when she made sure that her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything except that we have not cured as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we repeat the mistakes that initially led to TOMU, WHAT PROCESS, YOUR PROCESSION.
Only this time we will throw our anger and distrust not on others.
Luther Rabinovitz connected the fingertips into a pyramid.
This gesture had to mean infinite patience.
"You go too far," he said, "taking "incorrects" actions that have committed or did not do our grandfathers.
You go too far and when you say that they threw away their "wrath" and "distrust" on "others."
In your place, a person should not need a reminder that, understanding the past, that is, defending the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them."
There were no "us" and there were no "others."
It was a time of disorder - that's all we know.
"For which, if to be honest with yourself," dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I do not accuse anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what was done, it was done.
Then it was then.
There's nothing to say anymore - here we agree.
And how you should not blame anyone, do not need to justify, if it were appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why is the past, if not to learn -
The past is essential to make sure we forget it.
If I can add one word to it -
Luther Rabinovic's pyramidka collapsed.
"I'll consider your report," he said, releasing it.
The next day, on the way to work, she was knocked down by a motorcyclist who drove to the pavement, as described passers-by, "in malicious fury."
Matches happen.
Lesotho's army says that the coup was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Representatives of the army Lesotho denied the fact of preparing a coup to overthrow the government, saying that they acted against the police, who were suspected of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, saying that the country's army surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital of Maser.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, stating that he had a threat of assassination.
Major Ntlele Novoi, a representative of the army, said that there was no really coup, but that the army responded to the threat of "political fanatics" whom the police tried to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces has taken action, having received several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that really plan to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to chaos," he said.
A representative of the South African government, Clayson Monela, said that the army's actions looked like a coup.
"Although no one has complained about the seizure of power by force, according to all the information, the actions of the armed forces of Lesotho have at the moment the main signs of a coup," he said.
Representatives of the army Lesotho reported that the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mottejaa Metsing manages the government in the absence of Tabana.
Tabane said he believes that he is being attacked in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho is very tense since June, when Tabana suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his joint government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, despite the accusations of the opposite.
Midfielder "Chelsea" Marco van Ginkel will hold the upcoming season on lease in "Milan," according to Milan Channel.
21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for medical examination.
Last season, he went to the field as part of the London club only three times.
Earlier, "Milan" rented from "Liverpool" forward Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at the lowest rate in 13 months
Eurozone production growth slowed down to the lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The last value of the Eurozone manufacturing sector (PMI) on Markit fell to 55.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed, and enterprises suffered among the growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The values were received before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets will expect the bank to meet a clear plan to stop the recovery of the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation in inflation, which is only 0.3%.
There is a supposition that ECB leader Mario Draghi may later give additional signals this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone, similar to those used by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers becomes more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist Markit.
The production sector of Germany, Russia's largest trade partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level of 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be concerned, just like the weakening of Italy from stable growth to stagnation.
Signs that the impetus of growth has faded mainly industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also does not add confidence," said Mr. Dobson.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to still pour oil into the fire to analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the August study of the Eurozone's business activity index, it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "The Eurozone manufacturers obviously find life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - especially connected with Russia/Ukraine - adds uncertainty to still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit the business - and especially consumer confidence, and probably leads to the fact that some orders are delayed or even canceled, especially large orders.
He said that "everything is more like that the ECB, of course, will have to carry out some kind of quantitative easing, "although we suspect it will be limited."
Residents of Mariupol will put a living chain against the militia
In Mariupol until last week was all quiet - no one rushed to organize Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the people are horrified to see the arrival of the "military forces."
According to political analysts, separatists break through to Mariupol to get to the Azov Sea - recently the city of Novoazovsk was taken, which previously also was not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
Mariupol people decided that the Ukrainian army, although it will defend them, but its forces are a little against the armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and gathered to help the military.
They dig trenches, build checkpoints and fortifications.
In the evening on Saturday, several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a live chain, singing anthem of Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in case of offensive.
Volunteers collect and carry equipment and food, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closed, banks and ATMs stop working.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the terrible takeover of the school, as the children who found themselves in it, still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, in the south of Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom are children, were killed during this three-day trial, which shocked the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who deceived death during the atrocities at school
Exactly ten years after the terrible seizure of the Beslan school, during which 334 people were killed, including 186 children, who heroically survived the disaster warned last night about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed like an extreme degree of possible evil.
The tragedy united the east and the West in disgust, which miraculously then grew into action and hope for the future in conditions of severe grief.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who deceived death during the atrocities at school.
We have found amazing young people who resisted trouble, although the memories of the terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war, which is now tormenting Ukraine, in which the same children as they die, will now cease.
A girl who is trying to get back into the firing gym in the photo
It is recorded in the picture of famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when in one underwear tried to get back to the shelled sports hall after the explosion of the mine.
In the confusion of Aida desperately sought her mother, Larisa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them died, but in fact they survived.
"The woman told me to run hard, but I couldn't," said Aida then.
My feet were covered with blood.
I got up and climbed back inside to find my mother.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of operations, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday said, "Three months ago the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more operations.
A few splinters remained in my knee.
Its purpose now is to become a dentist, to help people just as doctors helped her.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it certainly has not broken it," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me and this fact cannot be changed.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember all who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzer Gapoev was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and dreamed that we would go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and I will start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says that the capture remains with her, although the memories are a little dull every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people from the UK and from everywhere.
When I see a photo on the Internet, where I climb into the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and do so that it does not happen anymore.
The boy who ran through the hail of bullets, believing that his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (Russians start studying at school at 7 years) and survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mama told me to lie down if there is an explosion, and hold her by the hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
And she said to him, Run.
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw the baby on the way, grabbed the child's arm and ran through the hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son from outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I could not save her."
In fact, Tamara was freed and was in the hospital with injuries on her feet, in turn thinking that her son died.
After their reunion, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and embraced me.
Damir was later brought to London (now the non-existent newspaper News of the World), where he was awarded as the defender of children from the Barnardo's Foundation, Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I would like me to stop remembering him," he said yesterday.
Still, I can say that in my memory he is dull.
I remember me as soon as I threw away all my toy weapons.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and it's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think of myself.
I remember the children I played in the yard, which never got out.
We never say they are killed or dead.
We say that they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store, where I was allowed to choose everything I want, and a trip in an open-top car.
But now he is afraid for places such as Ukraine, where wars lead to such grief, which he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I would like me to stop remembering it
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who last week was engaged in volunteer work in the women's monastery.
I want to help that way.
I want to serve in the police someday and hope that I will be enrolled in the educational academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48 years old, said: "37 children were killed in our quarter, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence right after the capture, there were simply no children who would scream and run around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She remembers her trip with Damir to London brightly.
The people in London wept when I told our story.
I understood when people at the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to "Shiry Blair and her Foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I would like to call Sheri and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Domir and me.
I remember how, when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir fired at them from his water pistol, and they ran away and played with him.
And only a month passed after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so ready to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I all think that this world has not become better in these 10 years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They are just the same children as ours.
I think war is a news reportage for many people when they are bored or when they are busy with something else.
I just know that these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not aggressive and not evil.
He is not looking for revenge, for example, he is not stuck in this past nightmare.
I know that he does not like to remember him, but they are very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember how he was lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He did not sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember throwing all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, he is above me, cute, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he died and that I will never see him anymore.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got to my feet, I looked around, I saw hell around me when the parts of the bodies lay everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember screaming to him, "Damir, run away," but again I was so sure that he did not hear me.
But he heard and fled.
Thus life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgy Ilyin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photograph after the capture became decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Rest: Survivor of Beslan Georgy Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and on the right Georgy today
On his bloody face was the imprint of fear when he escaped death, when the Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54 years old, the head doctor, took him to school on the first day of study before taking Vladimir's eldest son to the university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy stayed alone for three days nightmare," she recalled.
Not quite one, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George survived.
The closer this date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
It doesn't seem to us that it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time before my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Westers in the soul: Georgy's photo (left) was one of the most shocking shots of the attack and was immortalized in the sculpture (right)
I remember that George so wanted to go to school on the day that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I only found out that he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture crying George in San Marino.
George does not like to look at this photo, and she is hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this photo people from all over the world feel our pain.
Georgy says now: "It is important that it never happen again.
"I doubt we will ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never recognize the truth.
Now they are investigating this crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it was called up?
This world goes to something very bad.
"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, no one wants war, as it happens?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need to have tens of years to forget it a little.
She has influenced my health and I still feel her.
About three or four years I dreamed of nightmares because of the capture, but now it is better.
I returned to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I continue to go to this gym before each September 1.
I want to pay tribute to my old friends of childhood.
It's hard for me to enter the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I will not forget it, but I do not feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and entered the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I will learn to become a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but my health didn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it will not happen.
Georgy Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived despite being at the feet of the murderer terrorist
Incredibly: Georgy Farniev was at the feet of the murderer terrorist during the capture, but still he managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in the gym sitting next to the bomb at the feet of the killer terrorist.
Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We think it was yesterday," says Georgy, who wanted to study for a intelligence officer at the FSB, but could not because of the damage that was caused by his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I've left behind.
I'm older now and they say that children easily cope with bad events - I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - the next year - was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show where I was sitting on this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgy Farniev today with a photo opened on the laptop in the hospital after the capture
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for the physical condition, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm going normally.
But still health did not allow me to go to study at the Academy of the FSB in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical conclusions, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second hobby was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said, "I know that I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not what children should know about, and of course not what they have to experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse, when the anniversary is approaching.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to mark it.
I know that George will not go.
For him she must be even stronger because he was there, and I am not.
I waited for him at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he has returned to me. Here in Beslan the imprint is on everyone.
He stays with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It is difficult to accept when something so terribly unjust, happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He had several operations, he can walk, but can not do sports.
I would say that he overcame this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and this only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me and this is the best gift God could make me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know the families where new children were born, but I know widows who have never married again.
It is hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest at the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world - wars in different regions.
Why do these people fight for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and will be killed a lot.
If it were possible to seize all the rebels and throw it away, as far as possible.
Alena Tskaeva, 10 years old
The baby, who was traveling to a safe place fighter of special forces
Rescued: Alena Tskaev carries to a safe place Russian special force fighter (left).
Now she is ten (right), and she does not remember the monstrous crime at all
The world stopped breathing in 2004, when a little Alena took a Russian policeman out of the captured school in Beslan.
Terrorists released her, but with cruelty left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Kristina and brother Mahar in the gym of the school.
Mahar, who was three years old, escaped, but Alyonina's mother and sister died in a deadly slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since married again, and they have a little daughter with his new wife Svetlana, whom he called Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alain, who is now ten, remembers nothing about the capture and bloomed in a smart and cheerful girl, neighbors say.
"They are a great happy family now, and Alena and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a magnificent father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
One can understand why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Borussia Dortmund, said he was looking forward to being able to re-enter the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyful event in the career.
Of course, I am very glad that I will play again for "Borussia," - quotes Bild words Kagava.
I feel very good.
I am full of positive emotions and look forward to being able to come out again in the form of "Borussia."
Recall that Kagawa moved to "MJ" from "Borussia" in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to consolidate in the English club, spending in two seasons only 38 matches in the championship of England, scoring 6 goals and giving 8 assists.
The man accused of raiding a girl on the pedestrian crossing of the Ashelican in Faif
A 78-year-old man will appear before the court on charges of raiding a three-year-old girl on the pedestrian crossing of Ashelikan in Faife.
Gordon Stewart supposedly knocked down the girl at the transition to Pittenwin in East New.
Prosecutors said that Mr. Stewart led his Audi Q3 without proper caution and attention and knocked down the girl, as a result of which she was injured.
Stuart, 78 years old, from Anstruter, denied his guilt in the Sheriff Court of Dundee.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the royal lawyer, appointed the date of the court for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not be avoid in Vladivostok
The Duty Duty Free shop at Vladivostok Airport posted a sign prohibiting purchases in this store by a number of world political leaders.
Do not get rid of them with spirits, vodka and cognac.
The store administration decided that U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other well-known comrades will not be able to get away with vodka, cognac and spirits in their store.
And hung the corresponding sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama received a ban on the appearance in an even less accessible service to him by the kind of institution - Dietical canteens of Moscow State University, as reported by the website of catering establishments.
It is not known whether the American president had ever eaten in the dietary canteen in Russia, but the authors of the bans clearly seem terribly witty to themselves.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to agrarians
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that in the conditions of the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies in order to establish the production of cheese varieties in demand from buyers.
The Board was given during a visit to the company "Yugpitseprom" company "Agrocomplex."
The head of the government also gave the restauraters advice to reorient themselves to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the proper level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been introduced in Russia since August 7.
The head coach of the Russian national team Valentin Maslakov is satisfied with the results of the tournament DecaNation.
According to the specialist, the third place - a good result taking into account the lack of targeted preparation for the competition.
Our athletes performed at their level, - leads "All sport" words Maslakov.
Third place - confirmation of our fairly high team level.
It is nice that the advantage of the French and even Americans over us is minimal.
It should be borne in mind that we were not preparing for these competitions.
The season is over and we did not oblige our leaders to participate in the match DecaNation.
In recent years, we have become the second in this tournament, but this season we have updated the national team.
The French, on the contrary, put a combat-ready team, including 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which was repeatedly publicly announced.
But even such a composition of the owners of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians acted in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were much lower than on the same Diamond League.
The season is over.
Of course, athletes are not so important the result, especially in the competition team level.
The main thing here was - a place.
And according to the results, I agree, it came to the absurd, when 1500 m men were so fond of tactical tricks running, which showed the result below the average level... women's races.
4 hints how to achieve better quality underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or shoot videos under the water, you have a number of equipment options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof "soap," for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or action camera, for example, GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these pictures at the family holiday with the help of several cameras, all at a price of about $ 350.
No matter what equipment you use, several rules need to follow in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery of the camera and other compartments are tightly closed.
In addition, set your camera for the type of photos or videos you will shoot.
Some photo and video cameras have shooting modes or type of object that optimize the exposure for obscured underwater conditions.
And before jumping into the water, sort out how deeply your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are designed only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our buyer's guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Shoot a few shots - because many of them will not be.
The "soap" has an LCD, which will help you to compose pictures, while the action cameras usually do not have them.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the layout of the frame will be a random process.
So do several shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial shooting mode, which shoots several frames with a few different installations, use it.
Stay near the surface.
The amount of light is significantly reduced than deeper you dive under the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you shoot in the pool, river or ocean.
It will also allow you to convey more colors in the photos; the deeper you go away, the less colors you will see.
Float closer to the objects of shooting.
This is a great advice for shooting on land, but it is even more important under water due to darkened light conditions.
Especially important if you shoot on the action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you will have to approach the shooting objects if you want to fill the frame.
Bronze medalist of the Olympic Games in 2012 freestyle wrestling Bilal Mahov can go to the Greco-Roman struggle.
This was announced by the head coach of the national team of Dagestan in freestyle wrestling Sazhid Sazhidov.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of the athlete at the World Championships in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently Bilal Mahov is at the team of "classics," - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Sazhid Sazhidov.
In general, according to juniors Bilal performed in both styles.
At the World Youth Championship in 2005, he won the tournament and the third prize in the Greco-Romans competition and decided to focus on freestyle wrestling.
It has long been said that the new stage of our career will hold our heavyweight in the Greco-Russian struggle.
I will say more: Mahov can perform already at the World Championships in Tashkent - if he wins a discount.
But the decisive word is always for the coaching staff headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was such a man whose strength of personality could shake everything around, even in a gigantic organization such as the National Health Service.
Consulting an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to rid the patients of both suffering and pain treatment.
Among those who addressed him, his wife recalls, was an officer MI-6, who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lowson realized that while the doctors were passionate about diagnoses and diseases, those who are undergoing treatment mainly bothers something completely different - pain.
One day, in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like I used to be," he wrote in May last year.
It was difficult for me to find strength in myself.
Fighting the symptoms like the flu, he found that he was irritably rebuking his wife, Juliet.
"I want everything to happen faster, not later," he said.
When Juliet left for a week, Lawson found out that he was unusual and incomprehensible why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked his colleague to make an X-ray chest.
Just two weeks earlier he skied in the French Alps.
The X-ray results came.
It was mesothelioma, incurable cancer that affects the pleuver, or the shell of the lungs.
For most crayfish it is difficult to find out the exact reason.
Although some smokers are ill with lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancers smoked.
But with mesothelime in a different way.
In almost all cases, the reason is contact with asbestos, fibrous building material, which was once called "miracle," but which is now known is deadly.
For most of us mesothelioma - a disease that you can not pay attention to.
Asbestos, after all, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommendation industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked in close contact with him: pipe-insulators, builders, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it is hardly a reason for concern today.
But such calm is erroneous.
The UK, it turns out, is at the peak of the epidemic of mesothelioma.
Here more people die from mesothelime than in any other country on the planet.
With annual mortality of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from this disease than as a result of car accidents.
The annual number of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and the predictable number of deaths in the UK
The reason why we feel its deadly consequences now is that although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos have been ultimately banned by law in 1999), the development of mesoteles usually takes tens of years.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction specialties.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, laid in the houses where we live, offices where we work, schools where we study, and shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to the class, level of wealth, profession or age.
The bastions of election, from the fashionable London department stores to private schools, as it turned out, is not a salvation.
The building of the Parliament is permeated with asbestos.
Even hospitals that are designed to treat us were reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a pipe-insulator.
In fact, he had to think where he could get in touch with the asbestos.
Then he realized.
"It seems that there could be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels in the hospital of Gaia, where I spent six years on an internship," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and loaders - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get sick with the same disease?
It was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who have been trained in the hospital of Gaia and who later developed mesothelioma over the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I have survived."
How many of us will this disease become ill?
Andrew Lowson was diagnosed with "mesothelioma" when he was 48 years old.
When he died, on February 17 this year, he was 55.
It is unusual to live for so long.
Fifty percent of patients with mesotelyom die 8 months after diagnosis.
It is always deadly.
So now we can only repeat the question of Lawson: "How many of us are sick with the same disease?"
According to the leading mesothelioma expert in the UK, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK should survive, about 90,000 people die.
Most people don't know what they'll die in this way.

Quick review of reports from the courtrooms, where the victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesotes have spread.
This June, for example, Marks &amp; Spencer admitted that Janis Ellen was subjected to contact with asbestos by neighing.
She worked in the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, heading the departments of clothing at two objects, one of which was the main shop at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children over 20 years old.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesotelime, I barely knew about asbestos.
I could not have thought that it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They got their name from the word "asbestiforms," which means a fibrous structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrisotil, widely known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler seams, even in brake pads of cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization "a serious source of health damage," which can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (amositis) and blue asbestos (cribidorit).
The UK was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts assume that "there are good, though indirect grounds to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mezzalom [in the UK]."
The employee Marks &amp; Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the company's main store on Oxford Street, London Alamy
Janis Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is not unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that "the essential percentage of mesotheliers, when there is no known impact at work or at home, were likely caused by the impact of asbestos from the environment."
Most of this impact, he says, is due to the "ordinary use and impact of the weather" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which was considered by the Palace of Westminster, demonstrates how people, even in the very center of the government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind the premises of the parliamentary committees were infected with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be driven by something as harmless as "strong air flows."
Members of Parliament are often accused of persecuting their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.
Although the Department of Technical Affairs of the Parliament insisted that the Palace of Westminster received a "clean sanitary certificate," now she admitted that it is necessary to carry out works on the reconstruction of the parliament, improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that after the general elections of 2015, members of the parliament may sit in the conference center QE2 nearby, and not on the green benches of West.
The Goddard report noted that "the situation with asbestos was not managed in accordance with different rules."
It is impossible to know if this error of control will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who have failed to find out his contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50 years old, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital that has been successfully sued related to asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places where he worked, and dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009, when he was defeated by something that was similar to the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I began to fever.
It started very quickly.
I felt awful.
I thought I could not drive all the way to the house.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the plevra, the shell around the lungs.
However, like Janis Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mezzalomer.
In the end, he could not go to work for a month.
Puzzled doctors made X-rays of the chest and put pleural catheters to pull the liquid out of the lungs and send it for tests.
And yet his condition remained without diagnosis.
Gradually his health improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time the same symptoms were returned, often after he was engaged in sports and breathing heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to him in the reception room with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with "mesothelioma."
However, even then Abbott did not associate it with his own case.
After all, his patient was tens of years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and the counselling doctor showed his results CT and X-rays to a group of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, the sensor equipped with the camera was introduced into the cavity between the shell of his chest and the shell of his lung.
I am an optimist.
I usually just go on," he says.
I didn't worry too much about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Mesothelioma Diagnosed
Suddenly Abbott plunged into a meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of which offered him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where quite often there was an asbestos thermal insulation on the pipes," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill with this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people of atypical professions.
The most dangerous insulated asbestos in hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients suffer.
But many employees who walked through the pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or ate in the basement canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) almost certainly were actually exposed to toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, theoretically, saved life for the applicants, but a place that posed a threat to life for doctors who treated them.
He is still being removed today.
Pupils installed their Burning Burns on Asbestos stands
And this is not only hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and mayor's offices due to its amazing insulating and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools too.
In fact, many, most likely, were the first to be exposed to asbestos in the class.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry lessons, students installed their burners Bunzen on asbestos stands.
Web sites have appeared to pay attention to the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roofs of sheds, as a rule, contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison, laid in a huge number of our buildings," says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against the Gaia Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could remember was the demolition of the garden barn in the 1970s.
So be careful by carrying garden sheds.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, huge.
"It takes quite a lot of time to realize that," says Graham Abbott.
I returned to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I could not focus on what I was doing.
I stayed in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm no longer a Christmas meeting
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor's position to the patient's position.
As countless patients before him, he remembers how he was confused with the amount of information that had to be taken.
"It was difficult to realize everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor "How much time do I have?"
I was given about 12 months.
I remember how I thought, "Well, I'm not a Christmas meeting anymore.
That's all."
Mesothelioma is especially dangerous, since it is the mechanics of how we support life - the very act of breathing - causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos is destroyed and the fibers inhaled, they can get stuck in the plater, the shell of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleulev and can cause cell mutation.
"The problem arises due to the inhalation of needle-filled asbestos fibers," Professor Tom Treger, cardio-toric surgeon who came to the hospital of Gaia in 2001.
It was the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, leading the center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
The treger knew Lousson and treated some others who were probably exposed to being involved in the hospital.
When the needles of asbestos enter the lung tissue, says Treger, "breathing them to the periphery where the shell is located.
This is, in fact, an invasive process from the beginning.
Ordinary treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, causes hot controversy.
Some think it's worth trying.
The twitter does not agree.
"It's impossible to cut a Pleeper," he says.
It is impossible to approach her with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer "is not very good for chemotherapy," which "acts," but does not cure.
"Time from time to time there are patients who live for a long time," says Treger.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he was ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis, turned solely into a support and consultation bureau for the same patients.
"Allo, Rakovaya Central," he said cheerfully when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed 4 years ago, and he is still very energetic.
First, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and prolong his life for only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to surrender.
Lowson, however, "has managed to give everything a little more positive color."
Having met with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loick Lanzh-Lazdunski, professor of thoracic surgery in the hospital of Gaia.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a direction, I just called them and they took me," Graham confesses.
The average patient would have to receive direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best of the available treatments.
However, when such treatment is finally ineffective, many patients face another financial cause for concern - about the future of the families they will leave.
And then they appeal to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very small amounts could risk health.
It was then that they began to talk about the unfairness of companies.
Andrew Lawson and the hospital of Gaia eventually settled the case, but it was not "a full-fledged regulation," according to Morgan, as Lowson could not unequivocally prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with the asbestos in the hospital of Gaia.
After the investigation of his death, the representative of the Gaia Hospital confirmed, however, that "asbestos in the basement, which were discussed, was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, to tie deadly contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually tens of years after that - turned out to be a big problem for patients with mezzalome, requiring compensation.
Many of their former employers replaced the owner or closed.
Insurance archives could have been lost.
And those who are protected from claims know that on their side the time, which the claimants, of course, do not.
In response this year, serious new legislative acts came out, which facilitate the patients with mesothelioma process of compensation, even if their former employers cannot be tracked.
According to this law, a 350-million-dollar fund of funds financed by the insurance industry was created for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact, but who can not sue.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could award in the usual case of compensation - about about 120000.
About 300 successful claims according to this scheme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, as many who work with patients with mezzalomony, believes that about 350 million are "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a transaction written by insurers for insurers," he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what the insurers would have to pay if the time interval and patients with mezzaoloma could track the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, the Minister of Labor and Pensions, admitted that the law was "unfinished."
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that, despite the fact that seven people die every day, a quick action was necessary.
"People suffer so much, and they need help today," said Penning during Bill's second reading about mesotelim in December last year.
By that time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Professor Loika Lange-Lazdongski for 19 months.
After the initial consultations, Lanzh-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - tritherapy, in which Lanzh-Lazdunski boasts as much as 40 percent of survivors in five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see this in patients all the time.
There is some force that supports you.
When you surrender, the condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott went on operation in March 2012.
By the end of August he finished the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scanning did not show any trace of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots in my chest.
I had to be 50.
This is not a threat to life.
This is the end of life.
And again Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there is no trace of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally heavy.
You can think about practical things - about finance, when I die, for example, or what should be shown to my wife, how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you become joyless.
One must look forward.
As Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Tamzin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It is hard to understand what to say and how to say a lot.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I would not live to my old age.
They reacted very differently.
Temzin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends, and many people called us very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that has to be encountered by all cancer patients.
But for patients with mesotelyoma such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimpse of the opportunity to survive.
This disease carries with itself (even as, ultimately, for Stephen Jay Gould) a dark certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mezzaloma is not a threat to life.

Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for the harm to health caused by contact with asbestos in the UK.
Asbestos global production grows to more than 4213000 tons per year.
Great Britain imports 139000 tons.
The Executive Committee for Health and Industrial Safety in the UK requires that all asbestos contractors receive a license.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters will swear to revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands of the democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to start long-promised protests in the business quarter of Hong Kong, as activists began planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after this statement.
The decision of the All-Chinese People's Representatives Meeting, in fact, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"This has not deceived our expectations, but still leads to rage," said the legislator Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And it is obvious that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending the decision of China, Lee Fei, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the All-Chinese People's Representatives, said that allowing the national nomination for the election of the head of Hong Kong would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when the UK passed control over Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents of the region to choose by voting the head of government, starting in 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gives the Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a commission to nominate candidates tightly controlled from Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision was made after the summer, when there were some of the largest and widely publicized protests in Hong Kong for many years.
Behind the big part of the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, the organizers of which threatened to block the financial district of Hong Kong, if Beijing does not guarantee a real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the headquarters of the government of Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement is moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they will rise in the waves of protest in the next weeks.
However, they did not provide details, obviously trying to avoid problems with state authorities.
In the online statement, the organizers said that the movement "considered the possibility of seizing the central district only as an exclusive measure, an action that can only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are very sorry to inform that today all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the central district will undoubtedly take place.
The state authorities in Hong Kong were preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and on Sunday security measures were strengthened at the government headquarters with police and barricades.
At the heart of the riots lies the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their own city.
The influx of residents from the mainland strengthens competition in the field of goods and services.
The fear is also growing that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, begin to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations put business at risk - a source of life power in Hong Kong.
"The protest they are talking about can lead to great economic damage depending on how many people will participate and how long," said the legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This is an idea that is harmful to investment.
The Chinese state media have also reported in recent days, in which the Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement were shown by saboteurs sent by the Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780000 participants - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong voters.
And in July tens of thousands came to one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
American culture of graduation balls comes to university life: freshmen offered to arrive on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to such a demand by launching the UK's first travel service category "luxury" for current students.
To leave a vivid impression of arriving at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as personal aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said that the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously congested car.
In conjunction with our new options for VIF, we look forward to how we will help this year's students get to the university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury.
The representative of the company said that, since this service has just been launched, the orders have not yet been received, but added that "students will order this service in the next few weeks."
The company also said that despite the fact that students need to pay for training about 9000 per year, she still hopes to find a market for this service.
Today's students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and VIF - exactly what is needed for this.
However, the National Union of Students criticized this service as torn off from reality.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Higher Education of the NSS, said: "This project seems to be incredibly cut off from the life of most students.
Many students who this month will start studying at the university, face a crisis of cost of living, when affordable financial support in the form of credits and grants does not have time for the rapidly growing costs of basic needs, before they can start thinking at all about how to take out thousands of pounds on something like a simple arrival in the hostel.
Feminists raise the issue of race and behavior of the police after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Pérez noted a shift in the Internet conversation among white feminists.
According to her experience, the white feminists who left comments put the gender above the race, when it came to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as the tension in the Middle West grew and attracted national attention, Perez saw the answers of white women who concentrated 100 percent on racial affiliation.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9 assassination, personal essays with such headlines as "thoughts of Ferguson on behalf of a white woman" and "Feminism - it's not only about the oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
But for Perez they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin color and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what had happened.
This is very symbolic for the crisis we have encountered, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so attached to race, they felt that it had to be pointed out.
For a professor of English at Ohio University, Corita Mitchell Ferguson has exposed the problems black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's happening to me and my partner, and I'll get 150 likes from everywhere," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how colored people are attacked in their own country, silence stuns.
"Why should women talk publicly about relations, but not about the safety in the public sphere?" she asks.
For black women, as Mitchell, who studied the issues of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between issues related to racial affiliation and gender.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly share these problems; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine the issues of race and gender in feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men lyricsed, and the basis of this almost always served as rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
Needed a white woman confirming the story to justify the lynching.
From the point of view of Hattery, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffrageists, for example, Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the fight for electoral law would be effective only for one of the groups: women or blacks.
"They decided to fold all the eggs in the right to vote basket for women, and the right to vote for blacks was to appear later," Hattery said.
A look back at such things gives us a clear idea of why colored women do not trust white women.
We have done nothing good.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women obtained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to make white women unite against the lynching of the South Women's Association for the prevention of lynching.
This group appeared almost 40 years after the black women first asked for help, said Mitchell.
From the point of view of Mitchell, the rise of the reactions of white feminists to the problems raised in Ferguson - the behavior of the police, racial discrimination - reflects the time when the white feminists had to "catch" the problems black women coped with in several generations.
"True, it would be great if activists who have such [traditional feminist] ideology would have taken the right to raise a child, as they treat the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
The second wave feminists who have made careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what it means.
Famous white activist of the feminist movement Gloria Steinem two weeks after Michael Brown's assassination took advantage of Facebook and published a sharp article by Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that the white Americans take more part in protests on racism.
"I hope that women who have another, but a similar reason to understand the danger in the body - and the views on racial problems, which are significantly different in the polls of the public - will be at the head of the changes," Stinem wrote.
Although Steinem is responsible for the more intersecting feminism, which includes the problems of race, and gender, its comments about race in America still surprise some.
Researcher at the American Business Institute Christina Sommers, author of "Who stole feminism?" said She The People, that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Stein's remarks about Fergusone are contrary to the criticism she had previously expressed.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, the "Lord of My Brother" to help the vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking youngsters, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
The relations of the police with the black community are not the only problem that promotes the leading line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Guard Service arrested about 63,000 minors unaccompaniment on the south-western border of the country this year, the immigration reform came to the surface again - this time like the problem of women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present this problem as important for women, she only needed to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercade.
When the vast majority of working visas are issued to [male immigrants], women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are responsive to women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich house "with pig" is for sale
The photo of the house, exhibited for sale in Suffolk, was removed by real estate agents, when it turned out that it depicts a large pig resting in the living room.
Put on sale for about 10000, a separate house with one bedroom stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was distinguished by a photograph of the living room of the house - which depicted a pig with a head resting on the sofa.
The real estate agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo is a home favorite of the owner of the house.
"However, the photo was posted by mistake and already removed," the representative of the company said.
In the detailed description of the house, Connells described the former house of meetings as a "unique separate house with one bedroom."
Despite the fact that the agency removed the photo from its website, it is still preserved in advertising materials.
Sale of the house aroused interest in social networks, where some asked if the pig is sold together with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the match of the fourth round of the US Open conceded Caroline Wozniacki, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to adequately complete the year and try to reach a new level, reports from New York Vasily OSIPOV.
How do you generally assess your results at the Grand Slam tournaments this year?
Of course, I am glad that I managed to win the "Rolan Garros."
As for the three other tournaments, I did not have stability, especially in the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I am upset.
After all, I could not even reach the quarterfinals.

Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicles market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will bring to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov at the round table, which was held by "Vedomosti" at the Moscow Motor Show - 2014.
The plan was drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted in late September - early October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures relate to electric vehicles and hybrids - the plan for the development of vehicles on gas fuel in Russia is already there.
The plan (copy has "Vedomosti") is designed for 2014-2017.
It is necessary to develop criteria for assessing electro- and hybrid transport and decide how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
The report to the government, which will describe the tax and customs measures to support electric vehicles, will be prepared by December 2014; the scheme of preferential lending and preferential leasing will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of machines, stimulation of localization and creation of service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015. It is planned to make changes to the regulations to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, petrol stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to during 2015. to formulate proposals for regional authorities to encourage the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of providing it with benefits in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016. - and proposals to expand the state procurement of such transport.
Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development has already by October 2014. will include in the list of indicators of assessment of the activities of regional authorities criteria reflecting the effectiveness of supporting the production of environmentally friendly transport, development of charging infrastructure.
The market of electric vehicles in Russia is only being formed - in 2013. around 100 electric vehicles have been sold throughout the country.
In the beginning of 2014 The import duty on electric vehicles has been reset, so the sales will amount to about 500 pieces, says Andrei Pankov, Chief Executive Officer of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia.
But the five-fold growth does not make electric vehicles any noticeable: in 2013. According to the Association of European Businesses, 2.78 million cars and light commercial vehicles have been sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports into Russia.
Renault is being prepared to start imports - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says Nicolas Remize, Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships in Russia.
Most other manufacturers of electric transport have taken a waiting position in relation to Russia.
The development of electric vehicles also has Russian manufacturers - "," GAZ, ," but the issue is miserable.
For example, in January - July 2014, according to "ASM-holding," "AvtoVAZ" released 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low due to the high cost of electric vehicles, says the director of "AvtoVAZ" for engineering Sergei Amanov, without the state support of a breakthrough in this segment....
The development of the Russian market of electric vehicles in addition to the high cost of cars (the electric vehicles that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as expensive as analogues with internal combustion engines) restrains the lack of charging infrastructure (refueling stations - units), General Director of Autostat Sergei Tselikov sighs.
Due to the high cost and low rates of electric vehicles in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, says Mikhail Podorozhansky, editor-in-chief of "Avtorev," Tselikov agrees with him.
On the contrary, manufacturers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional.
The Russian market of electric vehicles has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "electromobil" is real; in particular, the emergence of new charging stations will contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, stresses the president of the BMW group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by the state company "Russian Grids": several stations have been built in Moscow, about 80 more will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of a network of gas stations are also underway with other regions.
According to the director of the department of "Russian Grids" Vladimir Sofyin, the company believes in the market of electric vehicles and is ready to build gas stations throughout the country, but there are problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of various brands.
In addition, "Russian Grids" as a grid company have no right to sell electricity, the opportunity to do this in relation to charging electric vehicles is being developed.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the electric vehicles market in Russia to reset the customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension, expansion of the preferential list is being worked out.
The replacement of the environmental transport tax (the idea is discussed and concerns all machines) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, says Pankov.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where the reduction of the tax has led to a sharp increase in sales of electric vehicles - now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, we need incentive measures for car owners, for example, free parking in the city center (as already done in Moscow), Pankov is sure, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles on dedicated lanes, which is not yet in Russia.
A private jet crashed in Colorado
The single-motor Piper PA-46 crashed in the American state of Colorado.
Three out of five people in it died, ITAR-TASS reports.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the runway of the airport of Denver.
Now the causes of the tragedy are determined.
In the Donetsk region deal with captured militants of the battalion "Donbass."
The guards were surrounded by Ilovai.
They were devoted to their own commanders, and dozens of siloviki died under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation in the south-east of Ukraine would not really be like to fight.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
The gunners from the Donbass battalion remained alive after the "meat-cut" they had fallen under Ilovai.
In the encirclement of the army of the Donetsk People's Republic, the militants spent several days actually abandoned by their commanders and authorities of Ukraine.
When the staff reported that the "rings" can be reached through the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But just a couple of minutes from all sides were shells and bullets.
"According to the information given to me we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave," the acting newspaper says. Deputy commander of the battalion, having a call sign "Lermontov."
And when we went down to the lowland between the Multiplie and Chervonoselsky, a cross-fire began with anti-tank guided missiles, from "inches," grenade launchers of 30-milimeter, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
In front of me were four cars and three behind, as a result, only two of the cars remained.
An officer with the call sign "Lermontov" tells: almost immediately killed at least 60 people, dozens were injured, many died later.
The surviving militants are now provided with medical assistance to those whom they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give food, medicines.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and condemned them to their return.
We were betrayed simply," they say.
The column, the whole battalion, to destroy it.
In the battalion "Donbass," like many of his comrades, Alexey acted as a volunteer, because in the Ukrainian news told about the atrocities that allegedly repaired in the south-east "separatists."
Already here Alexey saw a completely different picture.
His mother in Lugansk was killed - not someone, but Ukrainian military.
My friend called me, said that there is a mortar shelling, that most likely it is Ukrainian armed forces, - says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
After that I wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not released from Ilovaisk, they said we were in the ring.
I have already agreed with the commander, the report has already written about leaving.
We were immediately taken to Ilova from the fees from Zurakhova.
According to the prisoners, in the "boiler" near Ilovai stuck people 300-350.
Now some of the survivors confess that if they could turn the time back, they would not have entered the punitive battalion for anything.
All prisoners were handed over to the DPR security forces.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.
Headquarters for food prices have been set up in the region
The Krasnoyarsk region has a headquarters, which, if necessary, will limit the growth of prices for products in the region market.
The decree on the creation of this structure has already been signed.
The staff included members of the government of the region, representatives of executive authorities and supervisory agencies.
Together, they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the region.
News Economy - Will Kiev reimburse Rosneft $140 million losses?
The head of Rosneft Igor Sechin said that the company estimates the damage from shelling of the Lisichansk refinery in Ukraine at $140 million.

Lisican refinery is the main refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of the enterprise was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichansk Refinery is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is able to produce fuel of the Euro-4 standard, as well as a lot of diesel fuel standard "Euro-5."
In March 2012 Oil deliveries to the Lisican refinery were suspended due to its unprofitableness.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichansky Refinery together with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-BP.

There aren't so many options for introducing new sanctions to Russia.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to weaken sharply against the bi-currency basket.
Geopolitical background remains a determining factor.

Twitter has tried to become more interesting for new users
Twitter's microblogging service has changed the process of registration of users to engage new participants in active interaction with the platform faster.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have thrown their microblogs.
Now the new Twitter users will view during registration a large number of recommended accounts service to immediately match their reading circle.
The recommendations are based on the interests specified during the registration.
In this case, Twitter automatically checks the subscription for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to take off his own checks, so as not to read those who are not interested in him.
If earlier users of the microblogging service saw only avatars of recommended users, then Twitter now displays a sample of one of the popular blogger tweets to help make an impression about a person.
This is the biggest change in Twitter's registration page over the past three years.
Recently Twitter is actively working on upgrading the service.
This activity is primarily related to the continuing attempts of the service to achieve break-evenness.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in user base growth and a drop in the activity of readers.
The company is desperately in need of more loyal consumers, who, after going once, would remain for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.

The program will touch all cars over six years.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand for a passenger car to 350 thousand rubles for cargo.
Earlier in Russia, such a program of disposal of cars has already acted.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is assumed not only to dispose of machines to obtain a subsequent discount, but also the possibility, if the car has reached the age of more than six years, to buy a new one at a discount when handing over the old in the "trade-in" dealer, Interfax reports.
More than 16 billion rubles were spent on the previous federal recycling program, which was in force from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.

Coming Out Simulator will launch a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Keis, known for Coming Out Simulator decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.

The army controls the new government of Thailand
General Prayut (right) appointed to the post of Defense Minister Prait Wongsuvan (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of the new cabinet of ministers of the country, in which more than a third of the positions are occupied by generals or generals in resignation.
Representatives of the army received key positions: ministers of defense, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Prayut Chan-Ocha was officially approved as prime minister after the king of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government for this post.
The 60-year-old military man, who seized power in the country as a result of a bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for the post of prime minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at the Parliament sitting.
Earlier, the army appointed MPs.
According to Prajuta Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by six months of demonstrations, during which the protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinavat.
Officially Praut Chan-Ocha will be a temporary prime minister, as the military plan to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that the military are trying to strengthen their power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22
against the background of complete paralysis of civil authorities.
Leaders of the main political parties were subjected to temporary arrest.
Immediately after the military came to power, they subjected the temporary arrest of leading politicians of the country, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chinavat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis is rooted in 2006, when the army dismissed brother Yinglyk Chinavat Taksin from the post of Prime Minister.
Both of them are popular among rural populations, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has repeatedly ensured their success in elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the capital's elite entered the anti-government movement, which since November 2013 almost paralyzed the country.
No one said that the mussels salad would be better, I didn't promise you, weaves the waitress from the new Palm Brasser.
It is necessary to formally admit that it is true, but the mind and the stomach remain adamant.
After all, everyone has long known: we say "Belgium" - we mean mussels, we say "midia" - we mean "Belgium."
Restaurateurs like to express deeply that the success of the institution depends on three factors: it is location, location and once again location.
There are places located not to be good, but even excellent, but some unlucky.
In short, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe "City" (in honor of that TV program), then "Odessa-Mama," as well as the restaurant "Bozhole" and the beer "Friendship."
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Only the tip of the iceberg was placed above the ground: a bar counter and a couple of tables, all the rest of the space is even a hint of sunshine.
But here it has fun, as in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows - TVs, where mermaid girls swim.
Belgian institutions in St. Petersburg have long been no longer a novelty, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 liters) and countless bottle (170-1550 rubles).
The companeous-positive waitress presents the menu cheerfully, telling that "midies are hearty big seeds," and it should be noted: it is the service, despite some deficiencies, - the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Well, for example, it is given to predict that the meat roll with a Vallon prune (280 rubles) - in fact, carpaccio, chopped to the same, so thin that parchment paper in comparison with it will seem ugly thick matter.
You can feel at least some taste, only if you go down once haltar.
With salads, it's even worse.
The classic Liege (260) would be the best to recognize as a crime against the Belgian people: some kind of sluggish iceberg, boiled once a long ago potato, swirling Kenyan beans, wooden bacon chips plus for some reason marinated onion.
With such a light salad you do not want to meet anyone!
The composition of the ingredients of Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If the unmatured quarters of cherry tomatoes or fried mushrooms could still be closed eyes, then why the mussels looked as if in their lives several times they managed to defrost and boil!
After all, I already know: there are quite normal Belomorian mussels!
They are served in pots "in your choice sauce" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
The sauces are half a dozen, the one that is made of white wine, celery and carrots, frankly did not ask.
There are food, and there is no aroma, and whether there was wine, and so remained a mystery.
But good relying on the mussels of freets with home mayonnaise.
Chicken water sore here - not a stew, thick to such an extent that depending on the mood you can decide, the first or second dish in front of you, but just a pleasant creamy soup.
It was stated that the rabbit local cook cooks in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
In fact, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: rosemary stifled everything.
It seemed that this rabbit during his life was fed exclusively with rosemarines, which made meat so unusual flavor.
But at the same time, the rabbit was accompanied by a wonderful - no, just a great pear in a caramelized crust.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also hearty - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
Maple sauce turned out to be superfluously watery, and waffles dry.
But the manager who came to the table very informally asked about the dining impressions.
So it's worth coming again.
The dollar rate rose at the MICEX above 37 rubles on the news about the West's new sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar by calculations "tomorrow" by 10:29 MSK grew by 27.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the euro rate rose by 30 kopecks - up to 48.73 rubles, according to the Moscow Exchange data.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached the maximum on February 19, 2009 - then it cost 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are discussing the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is of a long-term nature, and paired with the euro, and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark, - says the senior analyst of Alpari Anna Bodrova.
Everything connected with Ukraine, one way or another will be reflected in the course.
As long as it continues, investors will respond.
Today, rumors about the invasion of troops are not confirmed on any side, but the market turned out to be very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news yesterday was crossed out.
The week, according to the expert's forecasts, will close about these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period ended, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine - all these are links of the same chain.
The inflation is also forecasted to accelerate: the current autumn prices will be increased from 5 to 10%.
Soon, in addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will end, and there will be a vacuum while the networks reorient themselves to other suppliers.
"Vollar approached the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and returned back, there is no powerful hysteria," says Konstantin Bushuyev, head of the market analysis department "Opening Broker."
They will still see whether the promised sanctions will be introduced on Saturday, as NATO will sit.
The ruble, he said, sharply weakened after the end of the tax season, then went the news on Ukraine, moreover, the Central Bank last week said that by the end of the year it completely moves to the floating rate and refuses any currency interventions.
If you look at the day fluctuation, it was no different from the previous one during this month, it scared everyone with the mark of 37 rubles, - continues the analyst.
And so, in terms of turnover nothing powerful has happened.
The alarming times for the foreign exchange market were, I would like to remind you, when at the end of January there was an increased demand for currency, as well as on March 3, when the Central Bank shipped a record number of currencies.
UFS IC also sees a positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, it is the growth of the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as increasing the competitiveness of domestic producers by increasing the cost of imports, says UFS IC analyst Alexei Kozlov.
The negative points include the rise in price of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke the growth of inflationary pressure and, as a result, cause the rise in the cost of borrowing money, which, in turn, hinders the development of the country's economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the devaluation of the ruble somewhat smoothes the decline in stock prices expressed in rubles.
For example, the MICEX index during Thursday trading declined by 1.67%, and the RTS index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative size of the index decline is due to the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is explained by the massive desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, gradually emotions go down, and the quotes of the ruble partially or completely restore the lost positions.
"We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," says Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic disturbance is often misintrocerated
Britanka reported that she spent many years, thinking that she would die after a wrong diagnosis.
Carin Rogers spent most of her teenage years, thinking that she had only a few years left to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had a disease Sharko-Marie-Tuta (SMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that lead to damage to nerves outside the brain and spine.
The CMT UK Charity Organization reported that the wrong diagnosis is a frequent problem among people with ShMT, because so little is known about this state.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK have a SchMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, uncertain gait and pressed toes.
Patients may feel numbness or pain, and the condition is not cured and progresses, which means that the symptoms are intensified over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from the attack of Friedreich (AF) - a condition that was very bad for which the forecast was very bad.
Rogers thought she would be chained to a wheelchair by the time she would be 18 and die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, who is now 51, said: "A child I knew that I can't do what others.
I fell every day, and everything went for me more time.
I could never skate or skateboard with other children, and I was mocked a lot at school because I went and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations, to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked into the medical card when her doctor left the room, and it was written that she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose on where I shouldn't, and that's why I didn't tell anyone, but I returned home, found information about it in the library and wrote to the Association of the AF," she said.
When I got the information in response, I was shocked and experienced the most terrible panic that was possible.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair in 18 and I would die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in this interval.
I went through it alone and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk did not deteriorate as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just got up, hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease, because you would have been in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic examinations she found ShMT.
"When he explained what the ShMT was, I thought I had pulled out a lucky ticket," she said.
The Charity Organization of the ShMT of Great Britain announced a month of information about the ShMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on the entrepreneurs of the Washington zone is growing as the economy recovers
The recovering economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
The state and local tax accounts for companies across the country increased moderately last year, when the economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and the company in the Washington zone is no exception.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia totaled $27.6 billion in the state treasury and at the local level in financial 2013, by 3.8 percent more than $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden on the state and local business increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the years going on, when the accounts were reduced, in 2009 and 2010.
The taxes charged by the state increased faster, 4.3 percent than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by a firm providing professional services, Ernst &amp; Young and the State Taxation Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenues in the district, 56 percent, account for business taxes, while 36% of the tax revenues of Maryland account for the firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the lowest amount of tax revenues, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the growth of tax revenues is caused by a return to the previous level of the value of real estate in companies, the researchers say, which raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three years in a row, when the growth was less than 1 percent.
While a large proportion of these revenues fall on large states such as California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same is happening in the Washington zone.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia have collected $10 billion of state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent compared to the previous year.
However, the observed return of the value of real estate has no similar effect on the growth of tax revenues in the state and at the local level in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of tax accounts of companies.
Companies Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of the tax accounts on the state and at the local level in the form of real estate taxes.
"What's going on in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or a non-profit organization that does not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Taxation Center.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent growth of tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
The revenues of entrepreneurs also seem to be amended, according to these data.
Companies in the region declared corporate income tax at $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion corporate income tax revenues, the most in the region.
Although the trends are directed in one direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same speed in all three areas.
The growth level in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the average in the country, 4.3 percent, while the growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.
Only in Virginia there was an increase in tax revenues below the average, equal to 4.1 percent.
In Virginia there was the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each of which is the same corporate rate), equal to 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the district it is relatively high - 9.975 percent.
A similar study of the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia there are lower taxes for entrepreneurs in the state and at the local level and, in general, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.
The circle was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is experiencing competitive pressure from its neighbor from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a legislative act reducing the corporate rate this year from 6.9% to 6%, as well as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to achieve tax revenues targets next year, this law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs even up to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small business in the Washington zone seems to feel better and thus pays more taxes on the state and at the local level, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners - a transitional structure, which is arranged by most small firms - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate than taxes for entrepreneurs in general.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in revenues from business taxes across the country are likely to remain this year, when the VAT in the state governments and at the local level, which increased by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington zone may be lagging behind, as the reduction of federal expenditures affects the labor market in the region.
Bronze Age of Russian Judo
Home World Judo Championship brought the Russian national team two silver and seven bronze awards.
According to this indicator, the Russians lost only the main favorite of the competition - the national team of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who spoke in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in an equal final fight against Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation decided only one remark received by the Russians.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian team - on Tuesday three medals were won.
In men's competitions in the category up to 66 kg silver went to Mikhail Pulyaev, and bronze - Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian lost to the world champion 2011 and 2013 Japanese Masasi Ebinum.
Khan Magomedov, who lost his compatriot at the quarter-final stage, triumphed in a consolation tournament and won the bronze medal.
In the women's tournament category up to 52 kg also to the third step of the podium reached Natalia Kuziutina.
In the semifinals, she lost to the current world champion Mailind Celogmi from Kosovo, who at this championship played under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In the dispute for the bronze medal Kuziutina won Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament ended, she still admitted that the third place - this is not what she expected.
And again the obstacle on the way to the Russians to gold was Kelmendi, who won Kuziutin earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk bronze in the treasury of the Russian national team put Musa Mushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinals, his offender was a former representative of Moldavia Victor Skovortsov, now playing for the UAE team.
However, then the Russian won two battles and became the winner of the award.
Mighty performed at the home championship with a injury to the ankle, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he will take a pause in the competition.
As for the ex-Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he got to the bronze medal at this tournament.
Interestingly, his other compatriot, who took the UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko with bronze completed his performance in the category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which in the category up to 81 kg won Ivan Nifontov.
In a difficult battle of the small final, he won the opponent by commenting Frenchman Alan Schmitt.
On Friday, the tournament was played at once three sets of awards, but the Russians traditionally limited to one bronze in the men's tournament up to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Questions, and the Russian national team was guaranteed this medal: his rival in the consolation final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight did not take place: the opponent of Question could not go to the mats due to injury.
Men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was put in the treasury of the national team Renat Saidov, who spoke in the category of over 100 kg.
In the consolation final, he won a net victory over Brazilian David Moura.
Thus ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian national teams - both male and female - were among the main contenders for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, the fair sex was not lucky - they did not get to the medal.
But the Russian judoka players won team silver.
In the decisive confrontation, they in a bitter struggle with the score 2-3 lost to the main favorites of the competition - the team of Japan.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after the net victory of Khan Magomedov and volitional - Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals could not cope Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100).
In the same scenario, the bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, lost to the Japanese - 2-3.
The team competition in Chelyabinsk was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the end of the tournament congratulated the men's team with silver.
"The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could become champions," said Putin, whose words are cited by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the ancestors of judo - nothing here is obscure.
But I'm sure you can win with them.
Russian national team at the home world championship was much better than a year ago at competitions of this level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
Then there were only three medals in the Russian team - one silver and two bronze.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isaev.
We are all, of course, big maximalists.
Yes, you want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is among the eight strongest, he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in such a sport as judo," - summed up the tournament Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, whose words are cited by the press service of the championship.
Japan's national team is expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, having won 11 medals of different dignity, five of which were gold.
The next world championship will be held next summer in Astana.

Joanne Rivers family hopes for the best
Joanne Rivers is unconscious from arriving in a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a heart failure in the clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopes, sources report.
Doctors deliberately keep it under anesthesia and under strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "heavy."
The response was broad, including numerous online support from Donald Trump, Monte Williams and Kelly Rip.
All will be able kings
On sale the debut album of the band Royal Blood - a new hope of British rock, which brought rock duoes from clubs straight to the stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo is only a year on stage, but already has an active nomination for the BBC Music Award, a warm-up tour at Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the New York concert from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name a few months before the release received 100 thousand. Preorders, and the contract for its issue lies in the portfolio of Major label Warner Music.
Given the current deplorable situation in the musical market, the situation is out of range, because it is not about the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet voice representative of the "new R'n'B," and about the duo bullish in the form of British, playing with the level of volume and intensity, which was the last time in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the bets on the first album due to all the above mentioned circumstances were particularly high and already quite justified.
It was not for nothing that the duo took a name that could have infringed on except that very desperate hairy metallic metallics, and the blood of which kings flows, it seems to them, in their veins, too, is understandable.
It is, of course, first of all about the heroes of the previous level Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood set their goal to shake the stagnant blood of British rock, bringing him to a new height.
To make forecasts about the success of this enterprise is probably too early, but something can be said.
Ten of the songs that settled in thirty and a little minute - it is not so much a demonstration of phenomenal composer's talent, as a confident and powerful declaration of intentions.
Some of the advantages of individual numbers, of course, can not be denied: say, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not by the melodic line, but by the drum party.
Musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier to pound than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and closing the record composition "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeare quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a party of fans of heavy rock, but when playing in a row they merge into a more or less uniform canvas.
And this is not necessarily bad, even vice versa.
The strength of the Royal Blood is that they do not claim to the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (rather they mark the successor of Mot'rhead), but brought many rock duos out of the ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, was created for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, it is obviously crowded.
The secret is partly in the cunning use of the bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format, invented at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
However, it is not only in instruments, but also in the very approach to composing songs.
The heroes of the retroroca Zero with great difficulty were chosen beyond the post-modern paradigm, with great reluctance to admit themselves not just epigons, but independent creative units.
Royal Blood already sound so powerful and arrogantly that this pressure successfully drakes some secondaryity and firmness of the musical material.
And after all, who said that rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: the online store - and video producer, and a hundred other things - buys Twitch streaming service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news was a surprise not because no one expected that Twitch would be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, selling Twitch video service Google for a good billion looked completely ready, and this combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a general streaming service - the version of YouTube in real time.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; "YouTube for real-time games," according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play," the genre of videos in which omniper give (mainly old) games processing, as in the "Mystery Theater," are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch was met without much interest, a classic example of a rooted technology company that buys a potential competitor.
This is a secret why the deal with YouTube failed, given that, according to available information, it was ready to pay no less than Amazon.
Everything we have at the moment is a statement from Twitch Executive Director Emmet Shira: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals and they want to help us reach them faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobam like me, who claim that it will be better to do sports than watching it, it is difficult to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking a joystick in the hands of yourself.
One thing is to look over a friend's shoulder at 3 am, when she crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another - to watch a stranger gets 20 shots in the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watch their shooting without controlling the angle of view yourself, can be a recipe for headache worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the speed passages in which Rogers Bennisters of our electronic century complete whole games in record time, entertain.
But if it is not a virtuoso game or humor, it is unlikely that his channel Twitch will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics know like me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and this is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly Amazon will work on it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will turn off on Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could just absorb Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that would be happy to get any company: crowds of young men, which are dreamed of by advertisers.
As the head of Twitch Shir, Amazon and Twitch said, "both believe in the future of games," and this channel does not give signs of fading, even - oh - as a spectacular sport.
As a result of the 2004 terrorist attack, more than 330 people were killed, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to surviving hostages - almost all now students, with the parents of the victims, with the caretaker of the cemetery - the city of Angelov - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the committee "Mother Beslan" Susan Dudieva, who took part in the special operation by an employee of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, - says Elizaveta Antonova, correspondent of the department "Society" Elizaveta Antonova, who worked on a special project.
Having already returned to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was an advisor to the president for the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with the FSB officer Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What shocked me especially during the time of working on this topic is that in Beslan as if there were not these ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for all who have any relation to it, people hardly agree to talk about what has happened.
Impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But Beslan cannot be forgotten, and I hope we have coped with our task," Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the studio of the Rambler &amp; Co holding infographics, which has been working in the company since spring of this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's stay in power.
DPRK Launches Short-Range Missiles
North Korea launched a short-range missile in the Sea of Japan, "Renhap" reports.
The launch was carried out around 10.30 a.m. local time by Chagando province, located on the border of North Korea and China.
Presumably, the rocket fell to the Japanese Sea, flying about 220 km, said the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
MPs proposed to speed up the entry into force of the law on personal data
In case of success of the initiative, these Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015
The State Duma introduced a draft law providing for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is located in the basis of legislative activities of the lower chamber.
It was compiled by Duma deputies Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov (United Russia), Vladimir Parakhin (Just Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (CPRF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to more operative and effective provision of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the safety of personal data and compliance with the secret of correspondence in information and telecommunication networks.
The law, the entry into force of which is in a hurry parliamentarians, obliges to store on the territory of the Russian Federation personal data of Russians processed via the Internet.
It also makes obligatory recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, clarification and extraction of personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation, in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as indication of information about the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right on the basis of a court decision to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of offender sites - automated information system "Registers of violators of rights of subjects of personal data."
This law was passed by the State Duma in summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoi and Vadim Dengin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the CPRF.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in the Russian Federation, will have to pay for rent
Commenting on the bill submitted to the State Duma today, the first deputy head of the Duma committee for information policy Leonid Levin said that he sees no problems for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the law on personal data protection.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own personal data stores in the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "Rostelecom," who repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and already provides their servers, Mail Group, Western companies that now already provide their servers."
"In addition, there are several independent data centers ready to cooperate in this field," he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work on the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problems - they will receive technological opportunities for accommodation," Levin summed up.
Controversial bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that if the bill is adopted, Russians will no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about the services of online booking of tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the bill deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation the right to dispose of their own data imperatively determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation."
The statement of the RAEC emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to create a mechanism for informing the user about where the recording is carried out, the systematization of his personal data.
In this case, he will be able to choose which territory will be carried out these actions.
The adoption of such bills on "localization" of personal data in other countries has led to the departure of global services and significant economic losses.
Participant of the test with a bucket of ice water flushed jaw
Isabell Roberts from the UK screamed so much as the icy water was pouring out on her head, which damaged the bone structure of the face.
This test by the bucket of iced water did not go to the pain.
The woman was hospitalized after she was shouting so much during the trial by a bucket of ice water that she had disloded her jaw.
Isabell Roberts shouted so fiercely as the icy water was pouring out on her head that it damaged the structure of the face.
"Water was so cold that I screamed, but when I did it, my jaw began to get stuck," she said to The Mirror.
Water is poured on the 20-year-old.
Isabell Roberts in seconds before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but he didn't close, he got stuck, and then it came to me to understand that something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came the same understanding and they began to laugh, but I had to urgently go to the emergency department.
A 20-year-old woman from the UK was taken to the hospital to direct the jaw after participating in a popular hobby on Tuesday.
The clip became an internet-sensation and was published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militia handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The Novorossiya Army claims that the Ukrainian Su-27 was shot down and accused the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
As of 10:00 a.m. on September 1, the militia handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax by a spokesman for the press service of the Army of Novorossiya.
He added that "the forces of the air defense in the area of the settlement of Merezhka shot down the Su-27 aircraft, which violated the ceasefire agreements."
According to the agency's interlocutor, the Ukrainian side in the artillery shelling of the Lugansk airport used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.
The representative of the press service noted that the militia managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force in one of the field airfields, as well as to destroy two armored personnel carriers and two warehouses with ammunition.
"The losses in the enemy's live force - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, surrendered to 13 people," the representative of the staff summed up.
Interfax does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the "people's republics" of Donbass announced the transfer of 223 prisoners and soldiers of the National Guard to the Ukrainian side within the framework of the ceasefire regime.
At the same time, at night, according to the "Army of Novorossiya," the army of the Donetsk People's Republic "has stopped the attempt of the National Guard in violation of the previously reached agreements to withdraw heavy equipment from the district."
Then the militia reported on the destruction of two tanks and two combat infantry vehicles in the short-term battle, the capture of six tanks and disarmament of 198 servicemen.
According to the staff, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupol) during that night were five tanks, eight combat armored vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded
Last week, a large group of Ukrainian servicemen was surrounded by militiamen in the area of Ilovaisk in the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the "people's republics" to release Ukrainian servicemen from the encirclement.
The DPR agreed to do so on condition that the enemy surrendered weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of servicemen began to leave the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the encirclement of the battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semyon Semenchenko, on Sunday night another 14 people left the "boot."
In his Facebook Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are "in captivity at the 137 regiment of the 32 divisions of the Russian Federation and 9 tank brigades of the Russian Federation," where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian Defense Ministry denied reports of Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
RF MFA: Russia to Take Retaliatory Measures in Case of EU Introduction of New Sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in case of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions.
The statement of the Russian foreign diplomatic department states that the "concludings" of the European Council of August 30 demonstrated the inability of the EU member states to overcome the inertia of unrevealed support of the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on "absolutely unsubstantiated statements about the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of this country," the Ministry said on the website.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is influenced by the countries that are interested in strengthening the confrontation with Russia.
Members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full "dialogue between the opposing parties," stresses the agency.
It is also noted on the website of the Ministry that now there are no lens assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe has been deployed, as well as the number of civilian casualties is growing.
Recall that during the next seven-day period in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, EU representatives closely cooperate with American officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate between each other the injected measures for the period of action and degree of rigidity.
The new sanctions of the European Union may affect the energy and financial sector.
The Australian government also announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the field of defense, finance and oil and gas industry.
Tricky ways to save on university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second year, came up with a cunning way to reduce costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from senior students, offering them nominal compensation to keep their sale.
"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180, I got on the semester for $10 and cookies "Chick-fil-A," says Schroeder, 19 years old, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
The necessary literature for the last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1200 per year on textbooks and educational supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly choose online stores and creative ideas such as the Schroeder system.
Book rentals are becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often costs significantly cheaper than their purchase.
The company "Nibo Incorporid," which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of book rental has doubled since 2011.
Research in the industry shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores during the last spring semester were rented, says Vice President of "Nibo" Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the professional association "National Association of University Shops."
Here is an introductory course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Purchase in the online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you see in the university bookstore.
The ninth edition of the "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs about $290 on the price list, but the new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the website Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of a Used Way
If you are not against someone else's labels or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Casedey, 25 years old, a fourth year student at the University of Brigamm Young, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second copy of the textbook "Strategic solutions in media: Understanding the business side of advertising business."
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Breissi, Director of the College without Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emcherst, invites students to specify from their professors whether it is impossible to use previous publications.
Sometimes updates are insignificant for classes.
In such cases, the old editions can often be found for a very small share of the cost of the last publication.
In addition to the sites Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by "eBay Inc." is a popular alternative for buying used books.
Rental
To rent textbooks, you should think if you will be good enough to treat them, do not forget to return them and do not want to leave them after the course is over.
You can save over 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to rent "Mathematical Analysis" for about $ 20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take books, including any penalties that you can write for notes, underline and damage.
If you rent a book, remember: if you do not return the book, penalties can even exceed the cost of a new copy.
Electronic books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books actually take for rent, buying an electronic license for a certain period from distributors, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc.
Rental "Mathematical Analysis" on the website Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.
Brayce says that students studying literature can often find the most favorable prices, as many classical works can now be downloaded for free, while literature on natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
Despite everything, look at it.
Joe Golt, 29 years old, who is going to start studying at Pipperdin Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the price of the book, as it ensures that you are looking for the text you need.
Before placing an order on the Internet, says Golt, be sure to check whether the book is really in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was postponed for four weeks, and in the end he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin announced the complete inefficiency of the Far East Development Fund
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke at a meeting on state support of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East, that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, reports Interfax.
"15 billion rubles remained on deposits," the president emphasized.
During the meeting, the Head of State instructed to speed up the approval of the list of territories of advancing development in the Far East.
He reminded that the draft law necessary for the creation of the Torov should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the president noted, until July 1, did not approve the list of territories of advancing development in the Far East, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, increasing the transport accessibility of the region, removing infrastructural restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create prerequisites for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form the territories of advancing development, which should become competitive in relation to the key business centers of the Asia-Pacific region, the President said.
Earlier it was reported that the area of advancing development could replace the SEZ.
Why the galaxy's Guardians failed to save the cash desks
The "unstopable 3" by Silvestra Stallone returned less than $30 million out of his $90 million budget in the United States, while the "City of Sin: a woman worth killing" returned only $12 million out of his $70 million budget.
"Home Video" with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million on the first weekend, while children's films such as "How to tame the dragon 2" also disappoint the revenue.
The Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin's article points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be a bad quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the year "worst" year in history in terms of children's films, and called "How to tame the dragon 2" barely "functioning" continuation of fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at an audience of a few older ages, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the same as the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic of each film that was released in the summer in the amount of at least 2,000 copies between the Day of Remembrance in May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both viewers and film critics, suggest that the harvest of films this year is similar in caliber to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that the matter may be in changing audience habits and the growing popularity of streaming Internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favro, who is currently working on the recently released Disney film "The Jungle Book" told Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times are changing."
We must admit it and not try to chase what was before.
Unlike the current fall in the cashier fees in Hollywood, Netflix's revenue from the streaming service reached $1.2 billion, almost twice the figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on the franchise of comics, and predicted the "crack" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators claim that in his gloomy predictions there was a share of truth.
Due to the fact that in the summer of 2015 several potential cash hits are expected to be released, including "Avengers: Era of Altron," "Minonov" and "Jurskiy Park," other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
Producer "Peotle X" Simon Kinberg recently called the fall of cash collections simply "cyclical," saying Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Food sanctions do not frighten the owners of institutions with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine Russian suppliers - this is a terrible dream.
And in general, so far it prefers to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"It is better to eat little salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella," - says the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio about the quality of cheeses that offer him suppliers in exchange for Italian.
Mozzarella and Burrat's cheese ended in the restaurant first, they have a small shelf life.
Parmesan reserves should be enough for a couple more months.
What to do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005 I was on the Dorogomilovsky market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear: shocking memories do not let him go so far.
Meat there lay on carts only 30 centimeters from the floor!
There's a cat!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe everything has changed there now.
But the other day I was brought to the test of fish from the Far East.
So it turned out to be rotten!
I said that I didn't even want to talk to the person who brought us it.
Valerio is surprised that many things are common for Italy for the Russian manufacturer in a strange way.
A few years ago I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, hang meat in a refrigeration chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It must hang off to become soft to the muscles relax.
I did it all with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where have you taken such tender meat?"
I said: it's yours, Russian!
Why don't you have that?
Five minutes" walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" in the kitchen hangs a stop-list, which shows missing products: French oysters, sea hedgehog.
The chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" and the bar "Strelka" Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already replaced oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will be purchased by Swiss.
However, Regis is becoming more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Color cabbage - 200 rubles!
I ask, "Why, on what basis does it cost so much?"
They say to me, "Well, we also need to earn."
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
Far Eastern oysters we buy by weight, but they live for 15-20 years, imagine how much does their shell weigh?
At the price it turns out that it is superdelicates.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of horror stories for foreign chefs.
Standard history: "The first three months was all well, then the quality fell sharply."
The main claims: Russian suppliers can not withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many restaurants of European cuisine do not know what will happen to them when the stocks of cheese are over

Sanction menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are called mainly food sanctions.
It is forbidden to import into the country of beef, pork, meat and poultry by-products, meat delicacies, fish, molluscs, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
The restaurants began with suppliers: prices for products have grown, you need to urgently look for analogues from other countries.
Most of all, it will affect expensive restaurants with monocousine France, Italy, Spain, which supplied products directly from the "Maternal" countries.
The public had to be rebuilt before.
For example, when in early 2014 Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers have established the supply of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of summer 2014 turned out to be much more serious.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which are removed from the ban of fry of Atlantic salmon and trout, light-headed milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onion for sowing.
Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions may still soften.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist in conditions of uncertainty.
According to the company "East-West," one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
"The expensive restaurants will have to change the menu for what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergey Mironov, restaurateur, owner of the agency "Restkonsult."
If the chef is strong, it will not be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such chefs, and the development of a new menu can take two or three months.
The trimel from the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" is ready for this: you will have to give up 10-15% of dishes, another half of the menu - to recycle.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine are already beginning to replace dishes, such as a steak of marble beef - beefstroganov, says Sergey Mironov.
"The cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian cheeses, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, - says Oksana Glibchuk, representative of the East-West company.
The cream and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
The U.S. turpentine can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway - salmon, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The absence of European vegetables and fruits can be compensated by the production of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget network restaurants will be easier to rebuild than the premium segment: there are hardly gourmets capable of distinguishing the Italian mozzarella from the Russian.
Although it is difficult to have Ginza Project institutions, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with its own menu.
It will take a lot of time to replace," says Mironov.
Ginza refused to comment, citing the lack of owners in the country.
Owners of cafes Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from former Soviet republics are more fragrant than European
But a lot of restaurants, which sanctions will almost not affect.
These include institutions with cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine," Khatuna Kolbaia, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and cafe Vai Mae!.
All the cheeses for us are made in Russia, at the heart of many dishes - chicken fillet, exotic greens we do not use."
In the institutions of Kolbai have not yet removed from the menu any dishes.
Timur Lansky, the owner of the restaurants "Chaikhon N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions also do not embarrass: he will have to change only the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia establishes imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, - he says.
From the CIS you can get cheaper to cut, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
At the same time, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About Uzbek tomatoes everyone knows that they are delicious, sweet.
No one talks about Spanish.
After the introduction of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan Olimboy Artykov said that he plans to double the export of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the introduction of sanctions.
Restaurants fast food, who responded to the request "Money," also calmly respond to sanctions.
The press service of McDonald's said that the localization exceeds 85% and the network operates with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, Head of the Department for the Work with Suppliers of Subway Russia, about 80% of products are purchased by the network in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and the growth of prices for meat products that produce from imported raw materials.
In Teremka "sanctions products" generally occupied no more than 4%.
They did not touch the sanctions and noodles "Vokker."
KFC, Burger King and Throw Potatoes did not respond to the Money request, but other market participants claim that the degree of localization of Burger King is significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish restaurateurs are ready to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far East
On his humpback
In the meantime, restaurateurs complain that due to an increase in demand prices even on local products.
"For products for "Grabs" prices rose on average by 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant "Cherry Mio" - twice," - says the restaurateur Roman Rozhnikovskiy.
Even in Georgian restaurants the cost of dishes will grow by 5-10%, Kolbaia admits.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have risen by 10-15% since early August."
"The Brazilian suppliers have raised pork prices almost twice," says Sergei Rak, Deputy General Director of Stardogs.
Chicken rose by 35%.
Waiting for prices from China, maybe they will cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, the "Stardogs" will have a planned increase in prices by 8%.
Now it is so undesirable to raise prices, - says Rak.
According to statistics, the growth of public catering revenue for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8%.
This is the smallest indicator after 2010.
Retail prices will continue to grow, he admits, but it is unclear how fast: while most restaurateurs stocked up products for the next two months in hopes of overcoming the difference in procurement prices.
But no one knows what will happen in two months.
On the square in front of the mayor's office of Moscow there are a dozen tents decorated with greens and wood.
In the center of the stage, the musicians play waltz.
This is a festival of regional products with a fun title "There is time."
"We were going to make a holiday of local food for a long time, and here just sanctions, we hurried, organized a festival," - says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with musicians cooker Anastas prepares a salad of pasta and homemade sweets, the other day was a master class on cooking borscht with caramelized apples.
All of Russian products, assure the organizers.
In the tents - an exhibition of achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkortostan, venison from Salekhard, vegetables from the Moscow region "Lenin farm," cheeses from the Russed Italian Jay Klouz.
"The space for restaurants can be safely replaced with another salmon fish from the Far East," says Philip Galkin, the owner of the fish shop "Your People."
We catch a seal, a ket, a kizhu, a humpback, a tea - "king's salmon."
Yes, they are not as fat as the Norwegian salmon, because it is a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take him in his hands - he doesn't even move.
And our Far Eastern salmon you do not hold in your hands.
Only institutions without much claims agree to replace the Italian mozzarella domestic
In the window of his tent lie shrimp with the tag "Magadan," cod, omul, muksun, mussels from the Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin is sure that it is time to switch to fish from the Far East for a long time.
According to statistics, fish catching in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even in the United States.
Import of fish in 2013 - about 800 thousand. tons.
The shop "Your People" has been working since 2012, sells fish through the online store, before the introduction of sanctions served another one and a half dozen restaurants, such as "Simple things."
Now Galkin received applications from another 15 restaurants.
The same land can be made of our fish, - it is hot.
We froze, tried different recipes.
Now we sell land through the online store for a million rubles per month.
Our fish are cheaper several times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In confirmation of Galkin's tent, I prepare a portion of Philadelphia with a kenta.
Unlike the rolls with the semester, these have to chew longer, but the consciousness that this fish is our domestic, gives strength.
On the site of the shop "Your People" there are even rolls of the paltus and sea perch.
In sushi bars, however, to replace the Norwegian salmon prefer Chilean.
Galkin explains this by the fact that chefs are lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
"Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us," - gives his explanation the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitry Evseev.
Approximately the same situation with other products: Russian manufacturers could take the vacant niche, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project Boris Akimov, now we can talk about the replacement of imports from Europe and America by imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large multinational corporations, which have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace prohibited imports in contrast to our farmers.
That is, the ban will benefit primarily by large manufacturers of other countries," Akimov says.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
Following the results of mass unscheduled inspections of Rospotrebnadzor, three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the essence of the claims to determine the actions necessary for the early opening of restaurants for visitors," said "Money" in the press service of McDonald's.
In fact, no one understands what will happen next.
If everything is limited to grocery sanctions, this is one option that can be experienced, - says on condition of anonymity an employee of the company engaged in restaurant consulting.
If McDonald's starts closing across the country, the scenario will be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of reference traffic police
Payments on the helmet can be received without a certificate of traffic police - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of "Europrotocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft instructions, according to which from September 1 this year to receive payments on the helmet insured motorist will be able to do without a certificate of traffic police.
It is, however, only about the cases when the accident was issued by "Europrotocol" without the participation of road police.
That is, if the accident involved only two cars, there are no physically affected persons, the damage does not exceed the established limit and both drivers have reached agreement in the question of who is the culprit of the accident.
From August 2, the payout limit on the "Europrotocol" is 50 thousand. rubles, and from October 1 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions it will be increased to 400 thousand. rub.
The point is that often even with minor damage, in a situation where an accident can be issued by "Europrotocol," drivers caught in the accident, cause the PCT.
After all, if there is a policy casco to get on it compensation without a certificate of traffic police was impossible.
The parameters prescribed in the draft instructions are just designed to eliminate this obstacle in the way of introduction of the "Europrotocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum cash payment in connection with an accident, issued without traffic police staff, should not be lower than the limit on the "Europrotocol."
But at the same time it can not be above the limit defined in the contract of insurance casco.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically able to unload both employees of the PCT and roads.
But, most likely, neither motorists nor insurers will be delighted from it.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which can lead to the introduction of new rules of payments on the helmet.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what kind of work will have to be done to overcome the native Russian conservatism.
The driver in most cases will wait for hours of the inspector to arrange a small accident, because so reliable.
And it is still unknown what will be easier - to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of the "Europrotocol."
Saving certificate will make personal and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban the bearer's savings certificates, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of the irrevocable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will prohibit the bearer's savings certificates.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that the bearer's savings certificates do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper to the bank, because it is not necessary to make contributions to the Fund of the Deposit Insurance Agency (ASV).
The ingenuity of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and will suffer from it Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to ASV estimates, control 98% of the specialized market.
And the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.
The problem, explained in the ASV, is that the clients of a small bank who bought such a certificate, in the case of revocation of his license trying to get money in ASV.
Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates for bearers, may assume that their investments are insured.
The justified absence of insurance payments on these certificates in case of revocation of the license from the bank may lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency there were cases when the holders of bearers tried to recover insurance compensation through the court," - said in the ASV.
The problem, of course, is imaginary.
After all, no one will pay certificates to buyers anyway, because they have the law no right to reimbursement from the state.
If the case was that the instrument is not insured in the ACV, together with it would be banned and metal accounts, on which the funds of citizens are taken into account in the grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but no one is bitten on their existence.
The point is most likely that the bearer certificates are a very convenient securities, which can actually act as a quasi-money.
At the same time, their movement is practically not subject to control: any client of the bank can buy a certificate, pass to any citizen, and before cashing such a certificate can change many owners.
It is not accidental that the bill stipulates that the savings certificate must be a personal security, which should be stored in the depository.
And in order to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to issue without the right of early repayment.
That is, an analog of irrevocable deposit, which has long dreamed bankers.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Nyuport and Cardiff
At the weekend there were protests of those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff about 150 people gathered at the Town Hall of Cardiff on what was described as an anti-sumption.
Stephen Fairklau followed the developments during the weekend and talked to the protesters who came from everywhere: from Bridzhend to Belgium.
Germany to Send 30 Anti-tank Complexes to Iraq
Germany will supply arms to Iraq to counter the militants from the terrorist group "Islamic State," ITAR-TASS reports on August 31, citing a decision made following the meeting of representatives of the government of Germany headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
It is reported that Germany will send 30 portable anti-tank missile systems "Milan" and 500 charges to them, as well as 8 thousand. assault rifles G3 and G36.
Supplies will be carried out until the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian aid.
On September 1, Mrs. Merkel will speak in the Bundestag with a government statement on this issue.
So far, Germany has not delivered its weapons to "hot spots."
The opinions of German residents about sending weapons to Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that only so it is possible to stop the fighters from the "Islamic state," others fear that this weapon can eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The militia bombed the Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militia bombed Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, according to August 31 ITAR-TASS.
According to available data, this happened in the Taganrog Gulf near Shirokino settlements and Unnamed (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media report on the shelling of two boats of coast guard.
It is specified that the incident took place today about 16:20 MSK.
Teens taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two teenagers-bushas were taken by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
16-year-old girl and 18-year-old young man went on a hike shortly after noon on Sunday in Govetts Lip in Blackhit.
Concerned relatives called the police about 8 pm, when they did not return home.
A search group was sent, which included local police and rescue squad, and a couple found about 11 pm near the waterfall Brydal Vale.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and bruised his head.
The officers stayed with a pair for the night, and they were picked up on the winch on Monday morning.
They were taken by an ambulance in a stable condition in the hospital of Blue Mountains.
Two Unions Meet
The negotiations at the highest level in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the top officials of the future of the Eurasian
Let the situation on alarming (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delays), the EU and the Customs Union leaders discussed for the first time a number of "hot problems."
It is incomprehensible whether such a structure is capable of working effectively; but it is clear who has removed the cream from this summit.
The questions on this matter disappeared in the evening of August 26, when the Belarusians, followed by other Eurasians with Europeans saw in the television news of the new president Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader showed an example of refined courtesy, it was the behavior of a person who has just torn down the jackpot - and plans a worthy old age in the highest society.
How Maidan Lukashenko helped
The arrival of three major European Commissioners (EU ministers) to Minsk, who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf - not just the legitimacy of the president with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior Analyst of the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Melyantsov is sure that from now on Brussels will not be able to talk to Minsk as in a tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met Tete-a-te with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to freeze," he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the preparations for the breakthrough of the Belarusian authorities began long before the November Maidan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
"The results have been achieved with the EU - successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernization, - enumerates the interlocutor "Ogonyok," - and negotiations on international security were held with the United States.
The United States even removed a few sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them only slammed this process.
On the one hand, Minsk managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough, so as not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militiamen in Donbass with all severity, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave either the Customs Union or the CSTO, and in Baranovichi there is a Russian air base.
Brussels and Washington noticed the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it, Belarusian experts believe.
How successful will the Lukashenko movement turn out to be a successful movement to political diversification, it will be seen on how often in the near future Minsk will reach the meeting in the EU +TC format.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to promptly answer questions about what Brussels expects from relations in the new format.
Press secretary of Ashton Maja Kosijancic only said Ogonek that this issue is not a priority against the background of solving the issues of war and peace.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan may become the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of top officials in the new format.
The drop of tar for Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he was personally asked by the representatives of the European Union.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties are not against Minsk to remain the central platform for meetings both in the format of Russia-OSCE--Ukraine, and at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the "last European dictator" acquires the status of a fully shaken European leader, which helps to solve the global problem.
Best friend of the European farmer
Already the composition of the EU delegation, which included European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, pushed to the conclusion: the main underlying of the summit is not the tragic situation in Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the schedule of future negotiations on gas supplies and overcoming the fears of the CU countries on the Association Agreement of Ukraine with the EU looks more large-scale than peaceful declarations without specific dates and figures.
The Trade Commissioner, Carl De Gucht, nevertheless, outlined: EU representatives "come to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis, which has economic consequences, not vice versa."
It seems, however, that the crisis in Ukraine "works" in Belarus in the economy as well.
Its consequences - and primarily mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still experiencing sanctions, the long-awaited field for maneuver.
According to the head of the Mizes Research Center, former candidate for president of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the capabilities of Belarus to supply agricultural products to Russia bypassing sanctions.
At the same time, the supply schemes are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin at the summit was murmuring Minsk.
"The initiators of these schemes, - said Romanchuk "Ogonku," - are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out schemes of goods deliveries, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
Russian business needs to be restored somehow, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is due to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to establishing production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with the orientation to the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $ 4 billion exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trading schemes can now be very popular."
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the platform for negotiations between the EU and the Customs Union is ideal for Lukashenko and in terms of the development of economic ties with Europe.
He reminds that the losses of the EU agrarian sector from Moscow's sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has now offered agrarians only 125 million euros of compensation.
The Belarusian president can offer Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for the eurofarmers.
This could raise Lukashenko's authority in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the format of the Customs+EW is open, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with the Ukrainian colleague stressed that the initiator of the new format at all became Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any nasal to discuss, not to make a decision with the bay-baracht, after the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, to deal with the situation that at that time developed in Ukraine," he addressed in front of the cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, according to rumors, it was initially against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic department diligently emphasizes that Belarus, in the organization of cooperation between the EU and the Customs Union on its land, does not pursue selfish goals, and the ultimate goal of such a format is to create a common economic space in the future from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other areas, in particular in the field of security, put forward and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation," said Ogonek in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where recently scrupulously picking up words.
In Moscow, may appear areas with paid entry
The Moscow government considers the option of introducing zones with paid entry as a method of combating the congestion of central roads by analogy with other major cities in the world, reports M24.ru with reference to the deputy mayor of Moscow on transport Maxim Liksutov.
One of the options that has successfully proven itself is toll-free entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, we will see all the disadvantages and pros.
It is too early to say that some decisions have been made on this issue," Liksutov said.
Zammera stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar to Moscow in structure and load, is very important for the authorities of the capital.
One of the solutions taken from these countries is the already implemented construction of the central ring road, Liksutov added.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to let all the traffic through Moscow.
If there were sufficient detour infrastructure, it was not necessary to have transit traffic in Moscow," the deputy mayor said.
Maxim Liksutov also said that the introduction of paid parking significantly unloaded the streets of the capital.
According to him, the Moscow authorities do not plan to stop there.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital Sergey Sobyanin took part in the ceremony of laying the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CKAD).
Bored sinful
The film by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez "The City of Sins-2: A Woman for the sake of which to kill" did not the revolution that he could expect.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), filmed with minimal, but symbolic, participation of Quentin Tarantino, made a revolution in the relations between cinema, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental for modern thinking chain "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if we understand the thesis of the universe noir under the thesis, and under the antithesis - the space of comics).
From now on it should be read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos."
The "City of Sins-2" is chaotic both on the dramatic and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first "City," although, here, Marve (Mickey Rurk), remember, finished life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, only has time to catch - in the role of such a folk guard - from the air of knives and other axes with rods.
But the old people literally push the elbows of newcomers, as if dragged into the city from some other movie, about the meaning and plot of which the audience are asked not to worry.
So, its own story, shamelessly torn by the authors in the most interesting place, at the super lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Its own - at the lustful-frigid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something avenging her Dwight (Jos Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, for example, in the face of not to distinguish from Johnny - especially since the faces, like other parts of the body, the characters are demolished with inexorable regularity - is not a misfortune or even half a victory.
It's not people, we understand that these are archetypes of noir: fatal bitch, too confident player, who fits in the "honey trap" of sex detective, corrupt flap-senator.
Well, when the archetype waltzs with the archetype and archetype chases, it is no longer a movie, but honor that abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is simply ridiculous.
In addition, even in this fumatous world there is something constant.
The battle gateways from the first "City" still keep a circular defense against the prosing their native slums of the forces of darkness.
And the ghost of the detective Hartigan no, no, and look at the lights, and on Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem of the "City of Sins-2" is another.
Frank Miller was good because as a painter talentedly combined comic and noir, and as a director - turned the idea of how to transfer comics to the screen.
Comics and noir are two aggressively opposed "realities."
The phenomenon of the comic book in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, at the same time, when the novels of Deshil Hammet "Bloody harvest" (1929), "The Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of noir, called then hard-boiled school - "cool school."
Well, or pulp fiction.
Comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the sailor Popaya - the thief of the spinach, giving him a rich power, Superman, Batman and the searcher Dick Tracy to Hulk, Torah, Spiderman and other "aves."
But in any movie based on comics there was something detrimental: the drawn characters persistently did not want to get the screen flesh, remained pretending in the surrounding will-nilly "real" world.
Simply put, they were completely deprived of "existence."
Nooir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After world wars, the traditional novel - with experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - lost all credibility.
What Forsyths, what Tibo and Rugon-Makkars, what are the Bolkonsky and Rostovs in general thinking after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated in the format of soap opera, and criminal - that is, by definition marginal - the novel was raised to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammet on his skin learned what it was like to work as a caregiver on the front.
He was a communist.
By the way, they were at least close to the CPRF and pillars of the genre such as writers Horas McQueen and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassen, Joseph Louzi, Edward Dmitri.
Therefore, noir, the archetype of which they set, firstly, is rude and cynical, and secondly - purely social.
This is almost the American version of social realism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely by the fact that it was unnatural, but organically combined the comic with noir.
For the first time on the screen comic booked, not shy of its graphic nature, and did not pretend to be "real" film.
The darkness of the corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered murder, and the senator covered the monstrous son-sadist, was quite worthy of the pen of Hammet.
And the picturesque details like cut off heads, which sadist decorated his nest, the pen of genius James Ellroy, the author of the "Black Orchid" and the best - that is, declaratively nauseous - a representative of the neonuar.
The "City of Sins-2" is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller--Rodrigues' radical style before the comic tradition.
Probably this was largely due to 3D technologies.
When you look at the second "City of Sins," you feel like a prisoner in a glass ball, inside which the snow falls asleep toy clown.
However, most often it is not snow, but bloody scarves, but by and large what is the difference?
Well, there is nothing to say about sociality.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere we sometimes have, even on the side of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can return a girl who walked along the curved path or, say, to say to unconsolable parents that her destroyer is punished.
But when there is no place in the city of sin except sin, then sin is no longer a sin, but a norm.
Boring, as any norm.
The chaos of the "City of Sin-2" is simply bored.
For the sake of domestic rental gave this fresh sin a small, but pepper.
Titries warn: the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode which a person smashes his fingers, it gives hellish humor.
Hammet would like it.
The Socialists of France should "stop and put France in order," says the key ally of Frasua Hollande
Mr. Valle called on the deep-divided left forces to "demonstrate a warm attitude" towards the attacking socialist president, whose reshuffles did not find approval from the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay with him," he said, causing applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister assured that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the incitement of the conflict proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande begged his Socialist Party's comrades to remain "single" with the government.
However, Christian Tobir, the Minister of Justice, inserted sticks into the wheels, having come to a meeting of dissenting members of the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "lose their faith in the future."
Marin Le Pe, the leader of the extreme right National Front, expressed contempt for constant internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she does not imagine that the new government of Valle will last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is a naked king, but the naked and Prince Manuel Wall, forced to gather a new government when the previous summer did not last.
"And the new too will not last autumn or winter," said Mrs. Le Pen to reporters.
She repeated her party's appeal to dissolution of the parliament, saying that she is confident that the party can easily win in the early elections and is ready to govern.
The ruling party of France survived the defeat in the March municipal elections, and the extreme right-wing National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
The Sunday Journal du Dimanche survey found that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is likely to split into several rival factions until the end of the presidential term of Mr. Hollande in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist from the University of Sianx Po, warned that the French will quickly lose patience if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but the public opinion needs to feel quickly that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may become even worse.
"City without Drugs" was left without a claim
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court left the claim of the administrative directorate of the regional ministry of state property management to the City without Drugs Foundation.
The agency intended to collect more than 7 million rubles from the organization. as a fee for renting a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear twice in court.
Today, the arbitration court of the Sverdlovsk region left without consideration the claim of the executive directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) to the City without Drugs Foundation (one of the founders - Mayor of Yekaterinburg Yekaterinburg Yevgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to recover 7.3 million rubles from the organization. as a rent fee for the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff did not appear in court twice, because of which it was decided to refuse to consider.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the management of MUGISO could not explain, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer the phone calls.
The representatives of the Foundation also failed to get in touch.
We remind that we are talking about a mansion that occupied a fund in the city center on Belinsky Street, 19 on a gratuitous basis since 2011.
This decision was made by ex-governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the administrative directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court to evict the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the agency demanded through the court to recognize the unregulated contract of gratuitous use of the mansion-monument.
According to the Directorate of MUGISO, the agreement did not contain significant conditions for the lease of the object of cultural heritage.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court rejected the claim, then appealed to the 17th arbitration court of Perm, which was satisfied.
Then the foundation filed a cassation complaint to the same court, which remained unsatisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the fund at the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court took the side of the management.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was signed, under which the fund again began to pay rent, the head of the city Yevgeny Roizman told about it.
The rent was assigned 300 thousand. rub. per month.
The previous administration of the region gave us this building for gratuitous use, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration has decided differently," he said.
Tatyana Drogayeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the Mayor of Yekaterinburg was offered to leave voluntarily
On July 24, United Russia's deputy Alexander Kosintsev, Yekaterinburg City Duma, proposed Yevgeny Roizman, the mayor of the city legislature, to resign.
The reason was a criminal case against Oleg Kinev, a deputy of the city legislator, who was considered a colleague of the mayor, who was considered a colleague of the mayor, on suspicion of murder.
How Yevgeny Roizman found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known about the criminal case on the fact of "slander" (Article. 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of Yekaterinburg Mayor Yevgeny Roizman.
This was reported in the State Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Sverdlovsk region, where Anna Filatova, general director of the legal center "Protection" applied with the corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her of his blog posts that she was involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her former spouse.
Yekaterinburg Mayor is convinced that "this is another attempt to revenge for the truth."
iPhone will turn into a wallet
On the eve of September 9, when Apple should present its new developments, the press has new leaks about what can be expected from the presentation.
With reference to American media sources report that the sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of Apple's joint project and Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and specialized Internet resource Re/code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple, among other things, can announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which the new iPhone 6 smartphone will be available the function of a mobile wallet.
The companies themselves refuse any comments on this.
This feature allows you to make a payment at the cashier of the store using a smartphone.
Identification of payment will be carried out by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be built for the first time NFC (near field communication), which allows you to make contactless payment using a smartphone and the corresponding reader at the cashier.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (former Philips Semiconductors).
For the first time the NFC function was introduced back in 2004 as part of cooperation between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies included in the so-called NFC Forum - an association to promote this technology.
The first phone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone on Android with the function of NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, allowing users to tie a bank card to their Google account and pay with a smartphone on Android.
However, American experts emphasize that despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, American retailers still cautiously treat innovation and do not too willingly spend money on the equipment of their stores such systems.
Therefore, now observers hope that Apple's entry into this market will still make retailers accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their outlets.

Activists of the democratic movement of Hong Kong disrupt the speech of the Chinese representative the day after the decision on elections
A group of people loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the All-Chinese People's Assembly on Sunday determined a procedure for only two or three candidates to participate in the elections of the head of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first get the support of the majority of the members of the nomination committee, which will probably be full of Peking loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get into the ballot and forced the activists of the democratic movement to again promise to stop the financial center of Hong Kong with the protests of "Occupy Central."
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders are afraid that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a document describing China's control over Hong Kong in June, in June, the activists of the democratic movement held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the business center of the city and made a sedentary strike.
Reefing Lee is organized by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Bureau of Communications in Hong Kong.
Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-Chinese People's Assembly, Jang Ronghshun, and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Bureau of the State Council, Feng Wei, were also to speak at a series of briefings during the day.
Students-activists said that they will gather at the building of the head of the government of Hong Kong in the afternoon.
The United Kingdom did not mention the democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to join 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to join 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, belonging to the Palestinian autonomy.
According to the BBC, the decision to join the land of South Wifle is due to the desire to repay for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Defense Minister announced the seizure of the territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administrative administration on the western shore.
According to Saib Arikat, representative of the Gaza Strip, the world community should call on Israel to answer for "continuing settlement activity on the west bank and in East Jerusalem."
Putin Demands Kiev to Begin Negotiations on "State" of Eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports about his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stops fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia under the control of separatists, but that its status within Ukraine should be revised in order to give the Russian speaker the opportunity to defend its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call for the Kiev government to start negotiations with pro-Russian rebels as equal corresponded to the obvious strategy, which he follows from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorussia the actual independence to get closer to Russia, not the West.
In an interview with the First Channel of the First Channel of the television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the territory held by separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists recently called the occupied territories of Novorussia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peaceful negotiations will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians start campaigning for the parliamentary elections of October 26 and while government troops attack peaceful settlements in the regions held by separatists - "the sealant of illusions," ITAR-TASS reported.
"We must immediately start meaningful negotiations and not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's words about statehood were meant in the context of a broader autonomy, which was discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman's intervention to correct Putin's words "incorrectly" emphasized the decision of the Russian leadership to behave in relation to the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than an open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 millionth population is ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much heavier battle to join even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russian, and polls before the beginning of the conflict showed broad support for the desire to stay inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the authorities themselves to determine trade agreements and foreign policy, in fact, by handing over to the Kremlin the actual control over the territory that would connect the main territory of Russia with Crimea.
On the Black Sea Peninsula, attached five months ago, is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial naval institutions and historical sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and the Crimea there are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7, that Ukrainian legislators after the new elections to weigh the amendments to the constitution, allowing the separating regions to give the separating regions greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of the autonomy seems to be very different from the Kremlin's view and separatist rebels, whose armament and incitement are accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to agree with the separatist leaders, as equal, followed the new rebel attacks last week after the Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from the former peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of the city of Novoazovsk in the offensive, which the Ukrainian security staff say that they are afraid that it is the beginning of a campaign to seize the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea.
This resulted in large-scale civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Novoazovsky and a narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko addressed the meeting of the leaders of the European Union in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which was independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a more severe sanctions against Russia, which will be adopted in case of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 militaries entered the Donetsk region last week to support the difficulties of separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine reported to reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first out of 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who, according to available information, are kept in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airborne officers captured on the Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
The nude photo scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust for hackers who might have stolen the naked photos of his bride Gabi Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood indignation after a number of frank photos depicted by the naked Jennifer Lawrence, hit the Internet as a result of a large-scale hacker scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker, responsible for this, has about 60 frank photos of the star "Hunger Games" Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Apton and Kara Delevin, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lia Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.

Edelsten, who made a proposal to Greco last month, said Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photos should remain private.
It is horoakable that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greek, which is located in New York, according to available information, told the news website that the hacker attack was "disgraceful" and that those to whom it was directed "feel that they have invaded."

The potential scenario described the resource The Next Web.
On the resource Github was published a script in the language Python, which allowed to select passwords to the service Find My Phone company Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.

In this case, the method is consistently introduced all sorts of combinations of characters, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that in the service Find My Phone the number of introduced password options is unlimited.
With the correct organization of the security system, after several unsuccessful attempts to enter the wrong password account must be blocked and reported to the user about the attempt to hack.
Because of the vulnerability, users have not received any messages about trying to pick up the password to their account.
Hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to the Twitter user Hackapp, the vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and it was written a script program for selecting passwords.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user Hackapp and he noted that the above vulnerability is typical for many services, but noted that there is no evidence that such vulnerability was used to access the account "stars."

Anger turned out to be the most universal and functional emotion of man
The hearty expression of the face is biologically universal for humanity, and each involved in its creation organ and muscle group is not accidental, but an additional means of expression of power and threat, the scientists of Australia and the United States have found out.
They told about their discoveries in the magazine Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be found in the press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The furious expression of the face - shifted and lowered eyebrows, stretched into a thin line of lips, bloated nostrils - are the same in all cultures, and make it even blind children from birth, never seen it, notes the leading author of the study Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project dedicated to the nature of anger, scientists found out that this emotion arose for effective disputes during the conflict.
The more physical damage one person can cause another, the more opportunities he has to dictate his conditions, and he delivers it to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
Researchers have found evidence and other hypothesis: physically strong people are more angry and pass on to the application, consider themselves entitled to impose other unfavorable conditions for them, and also prefer force methods to resolve conflicts peaceful.
Repulsing that anger is primarily a "simple of bargaining," scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles, creating an angry expression of the face, should represent an angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thus make it possible to agree with his conditions to avoid conflict as soon as possible.
To check this hypothesis, researchers modeled the person on the computer, where each of the seven elements of an angry person was present or absent, and showed them to informants.
Although the lowered eyebrows or the chin put forward separately did not make the face evil, then the more powerful physically the participants of the study recognized the person, which was depicted with such traits of the person, unanimously.
The anger of man, as well as in animals, poses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of his own power, forcing to agree and obey.
A person blows up the nostrils and presses his lips with the same purpose as the frog that is inflated, or baboon, who demonstrates his fangs.
"The anger is launched by the refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form, which demonstrates the consequences of this refusal as effectively as possible.
But the most amazing thing is that none of the components of an angry face is arbitrary, they all express the same," said anthropologist John Tubi.
