The social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes envisage the preservation of travel benefits in public passenger transport.
Since September 24, the procedure for organizing preferential travel of citizens using a social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is changing.
According to the press service of the government of Russia in the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of benefits for travel in public passenger transport and lead the scheme of mutual settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No 161 of the Federal Law "On the National Payment System."
At the same time, the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions of its application are changing.
Thus, the limit of replenishment is now set not on trips, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - no more than 400 rubles in the summer, in the summer period - no more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now the holders of a social card on the receipts issued in transport will need to monitor not the number of remaining trips, but the rest of the money.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens will be 1/2 tariff valid from the carrier.
The remaining half of the fare is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule of replenishment of the social card with cash remains the same - in the period from 24 days of the previous month to the 23rd day of the current month.
The new order of travel on the social card will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to keep detailed accounting of spending money on the social card with accuracy to kopecks.
In addition, there is a possibility of returning credited but unexpected funds.
We also add that the scheme of settlements with carriers becomes transparent, as now half the cost of travel is paid by the citizen, and exactly the same amount reimburses the carrier budget.
No commission when entering the card of funds will be charged.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Road Economy and Transport of the Ivanovo region, said that in 2014 in the region there were more than 33 million trips using a social map, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
The regional budget provides for more than 470 million rubles for the provision of preferential travel of citizens using a social card.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During the call in 911 teacher confesses the murder of a friend
During the call in 911 voices almost without trembling, the university teacher Shannon Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that they need the staff who would come to them home.
Lamb stressed that the house has a "pisque" that is alive, but probably upset, and said that the contacts of the family members of the deceased can be found in her phone.
Inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note, carefully written by hand on a white leaflet of the lined paper: "I am very sorry, I would like to get everything back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," the note says, according to representatives of the bodies signed by Lamb.
Nothing pointed out that Lamb, who conducted two online courses at the University of Cleveland in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by that time traveled for 300 miles to the university campus, where, according to the police, he shot all the respected history teacher of the history of Itan Schmidt on the threshold of his office.
The police chief of the University of Delta Lynn Baford said that the university staff learned about shooting at 10:18 am.
He said that Lamb had made that truthful bell at 911 shortly afterwards.
By the end of the day, the victims would be one more: Lamb had killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, the employees of the bodies still tried to put in one picture the motives that led Lamba.
The information shared by investigators in both corners of the state, as well as students and employees who knew him helped to make a portrait of a talented, but perhaps a worried teacher.
The students said that they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gaultier, where Prentiss died, reported that he is not charged with violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book he wrote, in which he expressed his gratitude to the "beautiful people" with whom he intersected in his teaching life.
Both of them taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some preconditions for problems.
One student, who spoke well about Lamp, Brandon Bivers, said that he also seemed alarmed and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said that at the end of the school year 2014-15 told him how he struggled with stress.
Earlier, Lamb asked the University of Delta to give him a sick illness vacation, saying that he has some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Reclinar changes in university rules of employment meant that the degree of the doctor, on which Lamb worked so persistently, would not guarantee him to automatically receive the position of the teacher.
University President William Laforge said that he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "obviously, Mr. Lamb's mind had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
The police attacked the Lamb's trail after his escape from the campus when he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot from a 38-caliber recharged pistol in the backyard of the house, one mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, the coroner of the district, told Washington, Metell Johnson.
His car with a running engine was still on the access road.
It was no wonder why Lamb came to this house, although, according to Johnson, she thought he knew the people who lived in it.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb started working at a university with 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received a doctorate in pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of the long-standing friends of Lamp described him as a clever, charismatic and cheerful man.
Carla Hayston told her she was 15, and Lampba was 20 years old when they met through common friends.
She and her friends studied in high school, and he was a cool older guy who for several years tried to teach her to play guitar.
In those years, he enjoyed success among women.
All the girls melted when he was around," says Hayerston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, the suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently met for some time by the time of the events.
During the call at 911 Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of registration of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gaultier in a brick house, the back of which goes to the canal.
According to the police, the dog is all right.
Former husband of Prentiss, Sean O'Stin, said that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She is completely depressed," O'Stin told her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he hadn't met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigayel that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Ebigail both performed at one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stin said that his daughter writes music and sings.
Preantis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, bartender and part-time coordinator of the entertainment programs in the dimly lit bar The Julep Room in the out of the outings of Gothie, said that the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and lip harmoshka for few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were having fun and joining one another.
In the sense that they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a dead teacher, conducted seminars for freshmen and specialized in the history of native Americans and colonial America, - said Don Allan Mitchell, English teacher in the same educational institution.
He was married and he had three little children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Exoria and was the president of student brotherhood and student self-government.
On Tuesday evening, around 900 people, around 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and community members, participated in a candle lighting ceremony at the Cleveland University campus.
Schmidt Liz's wife and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We try to return our students," said Laforge.
The crisis has passed.
Today is the day of recovery.
Amy and Rohelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was helped by the authors of Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police statement that the call of Lamba entered the service 911 after the assassination of Schmidt, as well as due to the fact that although Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife, when he called in 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire less employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us informs that it will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as last year, while the retailer of toys and goods for children assures that will provide staff and temporary employees the opportunity to work more hours.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases throughout the country, which is less than those 45,000, which were hired for the holiday season in 2014.
Most jobs will be with partial employment.
The company announced that it will start interviewing the applicants this month and will increase the number of personnel from October to December.
Although a few months before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees in order to have enough staff in stores and on sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about "dating" with Princess Diana
The premiere of the film "Back to the Future" was a grand event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema and waiting for the arrival of members of the royal family, I noticed that the place next to me is free, and then I was overshadowed - next to me will sit next to the trailer to the soon released documentary film "Back in Time."
The film begins, and then it comes to my mind that I'm literally at arm's length and in one false yawn from a date with the princess of Wales.
"Back in Time" - a documentary about the film "Back to the Future" - includes interviews with Fox, Lia Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemekis and executive producer Stephen Spielberg.
The premiere of the film "Back to the Future" took place 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spielberg, "it's undoubtedly the greatest movie about traveling in time that has ever been filmed."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
The UN Secretary General says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says in response to Russia's military support for Syria, that there is no "military solution" for the almost five-year conflict, and the growth of armament will only aggravate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN Secretary General once again called on all participants, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France during the Ministerial Session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that the disagreements in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities "has made the situation insoluble."
Ban Ki-moon called on five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in resolving the nuclear program on Iran and the Syrian crisis.
8 results of the survey that show that Donald Trump does not joke
Some tried to put the provocateur label on him.
Others waved away from him, taking it as a joke.
And some demand a scandal.
But no matter how many Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's high position in the results of polls, they failed (y so far).
Ten of the last 11 national polls demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trump in two-digit figures, and some are beginning to seriously ask what it means for the magnate of real estate in terms of chances to get the nomination.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
Nothing of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate the Republican party.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry lost to the gaining popularity to German Kein, none of which won one state in the process of nomination.
And there are many reasons why he would fight at the general elections.
But external groups, such as the "Supercomtee of Political Acts" by Jeb Bush, and the economic conservative group "Growth Club" recognize Trump's unrelenting power and begin to get their dollars to cover him.
Here are some figures of surveys that indicate that the magnate of real estate is not just an intermediate phase:
Trump's sympathies rankings turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidateship in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive attitude towards this magnate in the real estate sector.
By mid-July it was 40%.
In early August, it was 52%.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive attitude towards Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say that they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators win the top in the initial stages.
The Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week revealed that 60% of the Republicans there are positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of those who voted for GOP would have arranged Trump as a candidate.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67 percent of Republicans said that they either treated "with delight," or with "satisfying" if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say that they would be "set up" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would treat "with delight" against 40 percent of those who speak the same about Trump).
Next in terms of delight?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans say that they will be "unsatisfied" or "set up" if the favorite of the establishment of Jeb Bush becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump's temperament a problem.
While Trump is massively criticized for his chism and insults, 52% of voters who are inclined to Republicans across the country think that the magnate has a suitable temperament in order to be president, as ABC News/Washington post showed, conducted on Monday.
The same figure appears at the first closed meeting in the country in the state of Iowa, where the same 52% of Republicans think that he has the same person who can be the main commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44% think he's not the person who can be effective in office, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to this idea.
When they put on their hats of connoisseurs, Republican voters think that Trump is serious.
When asked who is the most likely winner in the nomination of GOP, four out of 10 said that Trump was a favorite, according to a survey by CNN/ORC last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of 10 were put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Complete exposure: GOP voters had no proper magical crying before.
At the same time, in the last cycle cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most probable candidate, while only 28% supported the possible candidate Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider Trump's campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans would unite around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of all the others.
Some connoisseurs indicate that such a spread is likely to play Trump's advantage, and at the same time Trump's not supporting Trump is evenly distributed among supporting more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in the hypothetical competition "one-on-one" between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He is ahead of Carly Fiorin by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Casich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He has a draw with Ted Cruise.
The only candidate who bypasses him?
Ben Carson drove the businessman to a whole 19 points in the hypothetical competition "one-on-one."
A little more than half of Donald Trump's supporters say they have changed their minds.
The new CBS/NYT survey conducted on Tuesday shows that only more than half of Trump's voters say they are confident in their voices.
Obviously, much can happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump's most tense competition at the moment - with a colleague outsider, Neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have changed their minds are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico two months ago "violators" in his speech, opening the campaign, the topic of immigration has become the most relevant in conversations in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's graze will turn away key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican party and prevent rebranding.
But in accordance with the ABC/Post survey conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump in matters of immigration.
So as long as immigration attracts general attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain on the same position.
Disappointment by the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on the support of approximately half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
A sage of 10 Republicans on Monday, the new ABC/Post survey says that they rather want a political outsider than a person with government experience.
And they are also offended by Washington.
Des Moines Register/Bloomberg's survey conducted two weeks ago shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed by the activities of the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent of the "unsatisfied" and 21% "in fury."
The government will decide the fate of pension indexations in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options for the implementation of the law on pension indexation in 2016 to the real level of inflation, the RG reports.
She noted that the decision should be found by October 8, by the time the draft budget was submitted to the government for the next year.
In addition, the Cabinet discusses the option of prolongation of the decision to freeze the funded pension of Russians.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings is 350 billion rubles.
Approximately the same is the indexation of pensions in full for the next year.
According to Deputy Prime Minister, so far there is no final decision on the issue of who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Golodets believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not apply, while, to socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not quite fair that the society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are the irritated and reddished the all-eight?
Answers the ophthalmologist Tatyana Levashova:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
Forgetful of regular cleansing of the eyelids, we often contribute to the development of blepharit.
The output is simple:
do not grab your eyes with dirty hands, wear a special wet cloth for the eyelids;
at least 1-2 times a day clean the edges of the eyelids from the accumulated in them per day of harmful substances.
The cleaning procedures are useful and warm compresses with decoctions of herbs (salpheus, chamomile), dizzying the thick secret of the sebaceous glands, and then a massage of the edges, which should be carried out by circular movements of the finger pads;
bess washing makeup, do not use alcohol-containing means.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to even more thickening of the secret of the sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear scientists have created an atomic warhead.
North Korean authorities reported that the country's main nuclear reactor - the nuclear complex in Yonbene - is working "at full capacity."
This was reported on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready to respond at any time to "aggression and nuclear threat of the United States," as well as that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "in terms of quantity and quality."
The North Korean authorities conducted the last test of nuclear weapons in 2013.
At the same time, plans to resume the full operation of the reactor have not been reported since then.
Pyongyang claims that he managed to create an atomic warhead.
Also, the DPRK has repeatedly tested medium- and short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded that the mention of fraternal peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during a meeting of the State Duma, "the Russian News Service" reports.
Who are these nations now?
The fascists and murderers!
"Very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can not stand," - said Zhirinovsky.
The MP believes that it is necessary to remove all four-way, which contains this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed by the "God, the king's guard," and the Russian tricolor to replace the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is sure that if Europe wants to cope with the problem of refugees, they should stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that it is necessary to eliminate the root causes of this problem.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this problem.
"This is the essence of the issue of refugees," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in the name of reaching a consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible as long as people die, while bloodshed continues and until people feel completely safe.
"Thus, we can reach a consensus, but we cannot implement anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad stressed.
Recall that the EU countries arrived this year about 500,000 migrants, including Syria.
The European Commission said that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that migrants arriving in Europe may include thousands of militants of the Islamic State extremist group.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation in order to create their cells in the EU to conduct terrorist activities.
Residents of the German city arranged a holiday for refugees.
Over the last month, Germany has become a leader in receiving refugees, although recently it has strengthened its border control to restrain their influx.
According to the authorities, about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call significantly large figures.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have already arrived in the country.
The BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents give migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbin debuts in the session of questions to the Prime Minister
After the elections, Mr. Corbin's debut at the session of the Prime Minister's questions is expected to be very eager
The new leader of the Labor Party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon speak for the first time at the session of the Prime Minister's questions, for the first time measuring with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will speak with the first of six allotted questions in the afternoon; his speech is likely to be closely monitored by the press and members of the Parliament of the Labor Party.
He called for "lesser theater and more facts" in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said that he may miss some meetings, leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as a leader; it will take place after the appointment of the shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Congress of the Tred-Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labor Party leader to stand silent during the national anthem on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain, caused criticism from a number of conservative members of the Parliament and became the topic of several advanced articles in the newspapers.
The decision of Mr. Corbin not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
The spokesman of Mr. Corbin said that he "has stood in reverent silence" and recognized the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, Corbin Owen Smith, a member of the shadow office, told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the leader of the Laborers to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his conviction of the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in the team of Mr. Corbin, voiced disagreements on economics, defense and international politics, while less than one sixth members of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "dged in a stack" in the Labor Party after Mr. Corbin was appointed to office in the European Union and the government's restriction of compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin said at the Tred-union conference that the Labor Party has amended the abolition of the very idea of restrictions as a whole.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow minister of labor and pension payments, said that the party has "complete clarity" on the account of the fact that it was in opposition only to the government's plans to reduce the upper limit from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the Laborers, with whom David Cameron will meet at the "courier box" in the past ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labor Party leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says that he "attracted collective resources" in order to gain ideas of questions to Mr. Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Member of the Parliament of the district, Ailington North, said that the Prime Minister's questions cause excessive confrontation, and that he will refrain from witty answers and exchange of thorns, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economy in the shadow office, will replace him with Prime Minister's questions when he will be absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he addressed the Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercoe to discuss this issue.
Having become the leader in 2005, Cameron said he wanted to withdraw from the political style of the "fair Balagan," often associated with the procedure of questions to the Prime Minister, but admitted a few years later that he failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's questions have become a key indicator of the leaders" views, their ability to manage the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of the Parliament, although critics say that this has become a caricature and requires large-scale reforms.
"Ducked in Joburg" The homeless young people who learnt on photographers

Pound sterling grows as wages rise in the UK
The pound rose amid rising wages in the UK, while the FTSE 100 rose thanks to the proposal to purchase SABMiller.
From May to June, earnings in the UK, minus bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate has been the highest since 2009, and was met as a transfer to an earlier date of forecasts for a possible increase in quotes.
Pound sterling rose by more than 1% against the dollar and amounted to $1.5505, and 0.84% against the euro, amounting to €1.3730.
FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
On the background, SABMiller shares were highlighted, which increased by 20% thanks to the proposal to purchase from the competitor AB InBev.
The deal would unite two of the world's largest brewing companies, gathering brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares grew by 0.9% amid encouraging news from the rival group of luxury goods producers Richemont.
The latest data on Richemont sales exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China - in the key market for Burberry - again began to grow.
Glencore shares surged by 5% after the mining giant announced that he managed to get 2.5 billion dollars by placing shares, which was done as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's shares in the group for the production of paper and packaging materials were leaders in the index - by 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs lowered the group's rating to "sell."
JD Sports shares rose after the company, a sportswear supplier, reported an 83-percent increase in profit before taxation for six months to 46.6 million pounds.
Chef JD Sports says higher wages can prevent expansion
JD Sports Executive Director Peter Caugill says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in the cost of labor costs, he says.
Costs could affect the plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches campaign on the initiative from below to combat the onss of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onss of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
The wholesale food supplier, on the initiative, launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the upcoming infusion by Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and West Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and promote the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social networks and events such as "Adelaide Show."
The campaign is joined by retailers and suppliers of IGA, such as the manufacturer of Simmo's ice cream from Dansborough, which offers tasting in IGA stores, and the owners of stores selling regular tickets to customers for the matches of the South Australian Football League.
It is expected that Metcash will reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29 - the day when this wholesale supplier of food, spirits and household goods will spend its annual day of investor strategies.
There are a lot of things at stake, as in South Australia and Western Australia, the IGA brand stores account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as adherents of familiar routes, so the market here is more favorable for IGA retailers than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Africa and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will re-event 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months after the opening of its first stores, taking the volume of sales from all present players, but mainly from independent retailers.
In the report published this week, Tom Kirat, Morgan Stanley analyst, believes that IGA retailers may lose 360 million dollars in sales per year, and Metcash - 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, having achieved sales of 500 million and 600 million dollars in these markets, respectively.
The loss of revenue and sales of food products at a high level of fixed costs of Metcash may cost the company about 13 million income before interest and taxes, says Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash loses its market share in eastern states, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, and this despite the fact that the recent Morgan Survey research found out that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash food sales will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and by 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading stock manager Hamish Douglas, founder of Magellan Financial Group, noted at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "may be highly likely to disappear for decades.
Metcash refused to publicly comment on Mr. Douglas' comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the board of directors of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The share of IGA in the market has declined from 2010 to 18 percent, and Metcash's revenues from food products, which the company delivers about 1,200 retailers of IGA, fell by 43 percent compared to 2012 due to operational delegates and due to pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than 150 million dollars annually in order to equalize retail prices in Coles and Woolworths by a thousand positions per week and helping retailers IGA in the reconstruction of trading platforms, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider selection of branded food products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says that price adjustments and re-equipment of commercial areas are gaining momentum, and hopes that the company will increase its net profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports Tennis Australia President Steve Hili
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not critics for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis indirectly suffered in the recent scandal around his friend Nick Kirjos and for his behavior deserves more honor than critics, as said the president of Tennis Australia Steve Hili.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in a talented duo and often called "Special Ks," was involuntarily in the spotlight due to the shameful altercacy of Kirjos with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Soon after, during the hot qualifying match in Cincingenti, the judge on the street had to disperse Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrisona twice, while Harrison said: "Wawrinka had to lay on the blades of Kirjos, and I must lay on the shovels of this guy."
As long as Kokkinakis was last seen a crashing racket after Richard Gasquet saved Richard Gasquet from a possible defeat at the US Open, Heie is faithfully defending Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grotz for the right to be second after Bernard Tomich in singles in the semi-finals of the Davis Cup against the UK.
"I am acutely worried about one thing, namely that Tanasi was drawn into conflict," said Hili.
He really broke the racket when he had a leg at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break the racket when the hopes collapsed, and I know Tanasi good enough to be sure that he would not be proud of it.
But in fact he owned himself very well in fairly provocative situations on the US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he deserves credibility.
He is surrounded by a great team, he has a beautiful family, and I just think that he did a little dishonest.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works a lot, fits perfectly into the team, he has never had problems with other players, he is respected outside the court, he is intensively training, he is in excellent shape, he is a very purposeful and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Hili also supported the decision to forgive Kirjos for an important match, starting on Friday, believing "reciquid consent" the right way out for all, but hoping that a guy from Canberra will return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to fully focus on the match, not on the disputes around [Cirios]," said Hili.
And I think Nick gained strength very quickly, which is proved by people such as Federer and Marray, he grows in front of the public, he made a series of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to help him to realize the consequences of his actions, and I must, I think, to take him out of the center for a while so that he can reflect on them, and that is best for the team for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces an emergency, closes the border, delays migrants
Having declared the state of emergency, Hungary blocked the border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and delays those who are trying to enter the country illegally in order to keep the flow of migrants inside.
There were riots on the border - hundreds of migrants have accumulated in the border area, which has been severely negatively responded by the Serbian authorities.
Having indefinitely stuck on the section of the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, the people who fled from armed violence at home, broke up tents and settled in this area.
However, dissatisfaction increased.
When a police helicopter circulated over them, migrants shouted "Open the Border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian police of special purpose.
Some of them refused food and water as a sign of protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister has declared the "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, when they are increasingly arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution to the problem, not the accompanying damage.
It is necessary to negotiate with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The excitement on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after the block from 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to bear the overall responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in the overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that in the future (the next month or by the end of the year) an agreement will be reached, according to which EU member states will receive another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded that an emergency EU summit be held next week to discuss the immigration crisis that covered the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for early actions from Brussels or neighbors.
The state of emergency announced on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities more authority to act against the crisis, which allowed them to block roads and speed up asylum proceedings.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Peter Siyarto said that his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence on the section of the Romanian border to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished the fence on the Serbian border.
The CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata said that even the prisoners were connected to urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main "narrow place" and the crossing point of the EU border for immigrants, many of which are refugees - victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Victor Orban insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees - victims of military operations, who have the right to protection, and this point of view is drastically dissenting the opinions of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force in Hungary at midnight are now considered a crime of crossing or damage to a 4-meter (13-foot) fence of barbed wire built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, as well as include longer prison terms for people accused of trafficking.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," said the representative of the government of Zoltan Kovac in the southern city of Sedged.
We make it clear that the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Formally, the parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the reporters of Associated Press, who are on the border, have been watching the presence of armed servicemen with vehicles and dogs for a few days.
Dierdy Bacondi, adviser to Orban for national security, reported about the catch of 45 authorized bodies, trying to cross the border, on the border, and another 15 people - inside the country.
They crossed the border, breaking the fence, are currently in custody of the police and are accused of committing administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities quickly restore the fence.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia, having added a railway wagon to block one of the passages, wrapped in barbed wire.
The riots broke out on the main passage across the border near the city of Rjoske (Hungary), as the Hungarians placed an office for passing people inside a metal container, and crowds of people crushed each other to break through.
About 20 people managed to penetrate inside, while thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway from Serbia to Hungary, and announced the rejection of food and water until they were missed in Hungary.
2016 Elections: The advantage of Hillary Clinton over Bernard Sanders halved in the national survey
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the democrat race for nomination throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders catches it up.
Clinton now has 47% support among primary democrat voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up with 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, receives the support of 15 percent of primary democrat voters.
More than five months before the start of competition in the primary elections, the majority of democrat voters say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
Clinton's supporters are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton holds a great advantage among women and moderates, but this advantage has decreased.
Its support among men fell significantly, and Sanders lags behind it by only 5 points.
The preference given by Clinton by democrat voters to 50 years has disappeared, and they are now on equal terms with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton overtake Sanders by two-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has an advantage of 5 points in this group.
Almost half of the primary democrat voters across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the candidate of the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her only because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It may not be surprising that Clinton's current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not support Clinton at the moment, the views are more contradictory - only about a quarter of it would be enthusiastic to support it.
While 48% of the primary democrat electors say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters speak the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton's supporters are asked why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that the time of the president is now (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for this post (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also speak of an association that connects it with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also called agree on the questions and the chances of election.
As the vice-president thinks about the potential participation in the elections, 57% of the primary democrats would like him to join the race - although a third believes that he does not follow.
When asked who would they like to see in second place among the party candidates, the primary democrat voters in most cases call Biden.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say they would choose Biden second, which is more than Sanders's.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the participants of the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of democrat voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the general elections; but this figure has decreased from 78 percent last month.
According to Biden, Biden is in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most probable candidate has increased.
Nonetheless, in answer to the question, the most important thing for the candidate, the democrat voters choose other options besides the chances of being elected.
Similarly to the situation last month, none of the candidates from democrats or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democrats" candidates, or potential candidates, have shown a good result in some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most believe Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest and trustworthy by people with good leadership qualities.
Biden of all three is leading in honesty, and the strong side of Clinton in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of the primary democrat voters do not consider Clinton honest and trustworthy twice as many as those who speak the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27% do not have a certain opinion about him on this account.
Primary democrat voters also generally consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden's ideological views to be similar.
According to all these standards, about a quarter of the democrat voters have no opinion about Sanders.
Although Hillary Clinton's questions about the personal e-mail and server account in the state office continue to be the Secretary of State, the majority of primary democrat voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this did not have a negative impact on their general opinion about her.
But this is a completely different story among the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are dissatisfied with its explanation today, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public's opinions about this were divided back in March, shortly after this story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy about e-mail did not affect their general opinion about Clinton, although 36% say that their opinion about it has deteriorated.
Most of them are Republicans, more than six out of 10, who claim that their opinion about Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton considers it honest and trustworthy to electors from her party, this continues to be a problem for her among the registered voters as a whole: only 32% consider it honest and trustworthy, eight points lower compared to last month, and 15 compared to May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider it honest and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump both, however, get good marks on leadership qualities.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush show the best results in honesty.
Most people see Sanders as an honest man rather than not, but as Carson, many have no opinion about him.
The error range for the sample of 351 primary democrat voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the national survey Ben Carson close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times survey
These two candidates garnered half of the votes in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of support under their feet.
Republican voters throughout the country continue to massively support Trump, whose support percentage increased from 23% in a recent CBS survey conducted on the eve of Fox News debates last month, to 27% in a survey conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson soared in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoys support in all demographic groups, pushing Trump in a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The other candidates, with the exception of Carli Fiorin and Governor John Casic, rolled back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Woker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Hakabi and Florida Senator Marco Rubio together take third place with 6%.
The advantage of the sampling of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus-minus 6%, the survey was conducted in September.
The recent CNN/ORC survey, published last week, showed the growth of Carson in the surveys - showing support of 19% among the Republicans, for Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
Due to the growth of Carson's support last week, Trump made several critical attacks against a former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of a freshmen of Baruch College
Approximately two years after the death of a college student during the ritual of consecration to the brotherhood in the mountains of Pokono in Pennsylvania, the charge of murder was brought against five people.
"The member of the brotherhood of Pi Delta Psi from the New York Baruch College brutally attacked Chan Chanik "Michael" Deng during the initiation in September 2013 and did not bring him to the hospital in time, which caused his death," the police reported.
Officials say that a student with blindfolded eyes and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back several times pushed while he tried to achieve the goal, walking on a slippery surface.
M-r. Deng finally complained that his head was sore and then fell unconscious.
The members of the brotherhood of Pi Delta Psie did not call at 911, when Deng lost consciousness, and waited for an hour before delivering him to the hospital, they say to the police.
They, however, found time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Gugl and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the brotherhood, to ask for advice, as the Chief of Police Chris Wagner told the press conference.
"At this point, the members of the brotherhood began to hide their personal property, essentially putting the well-being of the brotherhood above Michael Deng's health," Wagner said.
He could not be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the report on the opening, Deng received several blunt injuries to the head, torso and hips.
"Too many families have suffered as a result of the rituals of consecration to the brotherhood, as at least one student dies during them every year, starting from 1970," said Douglas Fairerberg, lawyer representing the family of Deng.
Brotherhood and their members should be held accountable and this step by the authorities is very important.
Monroe jurors declined in favor of the accusation of murder of the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including the m-r. Menga, will be charged with violence against a beginner and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold accountable not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that authorized all this officially or informally, it is," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College forbade the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood excluded the local branch from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be an increase in rates, and the " bull market" will stumble, the yields of the bonds will grow, and the economy will fall into the recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long it will take before the onset, and how long it will last.
Specifically for the economy, history explains little about time.
The recession came only 11 months after the first rate hike and for 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, although not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the US Central Bank administration stresses so persistently that investors should not focus on when it starts raising rates, and how much adaptation will take.
In fact, the game has a lot of variables.
After all, however, market participants may find that all the fuss around raising rates is exaggerated.
"The first raising of rates by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some, as a signal of the end of the era of "cheap money," said Julian Jessop, chief specialist in the international economy in Capital Economics, in his comments for customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the US to a more normal, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse, which many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a view of how some areas of the economy could react depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or around, the expectation of a rate hike can lead to instability for a while.
When the rate increases, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It is not like the share revenues slow down by 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the results of the increase in the rates by the Federal Reserve.
If more specific, the market has changed sharply over the past 35 years - about 14 percent - towards raising rates, remains flat enough for 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returns to normal with an average yield of 14.4 percent for the last six cycles, according to the recent analysis conducted by Bob Dollom, the chief specialist in the strategy of trading shares in Nuen Management, in the company's Nuen Management.
In Deutsche, it is said that the result for securities tends not to immediately become more pronounced at the stage of raising rates, and revenues from shares begin to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rates increase often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is put in such conditions that did not exist before and can accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be almost at its lowest point during the entire existence of the increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, the rate hike since 1950 only twice nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that it is for a long time, despite the fact that in the third quarter it is kept at just 1.5 percent, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increasing rates on such an unstable economic background can be risky and raises the question "whether this time will be different," Deutsche reported.
Market participants are preparing to raise the rates of the Federal Reserve for the whole year, while their view is cling to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many experts in strategies and economists believe that FOMC could approve the rate hike at this meeting, futures trade indicates only 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all rates hike cycles have been in the supercycle of the increasing financial lever in GDP, overlaid peaks, preceding the recession, very quickly after the beginning of the recovery," the report reads.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle at the moment - the longest, which the Federal Reserve has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, it lasts for 74 months and has not yet ended.
Fixed income also became unstable while the market expects an increase in rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one that is being implemented for the stock.
The fundamental difference is that the effect for the bonds will come faster than for the stock, when the Federal System changes the strategic exchange rate.
In the case of bonds, the yields are changing the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease of rates in the cycle.
At the end of the rate hike cycle, the yields on the bonds immediately falls," reports Deutsche.
Strategy experts from Charles Schwab believe that the rate hike will lead to the fact that the yields of long-term and short-term bonds will come closer, making the curve more flat.
High yield bonds often behave better in such a climate, although "we are still afraid of fluctuations in profitability," says Katie Jones, an analyst with fixed income in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the policy of the Federal System.
"In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has tightened to the prospect of a tougher monetary policy," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans rose, the yield curve is more flat, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all market characteristics while tightening the policy of the Federal System.
In general, companies that are leading their main business in the United States, will benefit from raising interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts will be in the worst position, as the growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market space, and their debt is more expensive - in financial.
"History shows that "quality" stocks demonstrate effectiveness above the market within three months after the initial rate hike," said Goldman Sachs analysts in the report for customers.
Companies with a stable financial condition bypassed the companies with an unstable state on the results of each rate hike in 1994, 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high return on equity, as well as low volatility shares also showed better efficiency than low-quality shares, an average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (interest points) respectively.
Debt will become a big question.
The companies with a high interest rate of the floating rate will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
Depositors could also see profits through higher profitability, although experts diverge in how quickly it will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM," says Andrew Bingham, member of the parliament of conservatives
Conservative MP member Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "reducing standards"
Proving that it is becoming less different from the commercial competitor
Also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award is just tossed with Brits
The colleague of the Parliament, Damien Collins, who hit The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," said the leader of the parliament, prompting the TV and radio company to prove that it does anything that commercial companies do not do.
Conservative MP member Andrew Bingham also told the BBC management that it seems that the public radio station is "stupid" and becomes less distinct from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems to me not like to use the word "susage" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you try to do something else - here are two examples that the first came to my mind, in which you actually only copy what is already on the market," - said Mr. Bingham.
BBC Director General rejected the accusations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn thanks to Radio 3, I will not learn about classical music nowhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and the creation of music will not really compare with anyone else.
"It is also very important, I think Radio 3's interest in finding new music and promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davy claimed that the radio station has to work much more to attract audiences than in the past, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child who was attacked for attacking commercial competitors during the hearings of a special Committee for Culture, Media and Sports.
Tory Damien Collins, a member of the Parliament, attacked The Voice, a talent show that BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of GBP 22 million.
You see, why is this program often discussed due to the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that BBC 1 shows, in which Paloma Feit and Boy George participate as judges, was made in the "typical style of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "has a hit in its own home stable" next time it will launch an entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of new seasons The Voice in the future or the use of money for those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
The growth of online sales slowed as much as possible in August, and the fault may be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, there was an increase in online sales by seven percent
Last month, the slowest growth has been observed since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago through the use of mobile shopping devices
Experts believe that November Black Friday could contribute to the deterrence of spending
For about ten years, virtual shopping has been experiencing booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that now there are signs of online sales leveling, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase during the first three months of 2015.
Total expenses for online shopping in August showed a minimal growth since they began to fix in 2000, having increased by just five percent.
Experts say that now there are signs of online sales leveling, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and return back to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago, when buyers began to use their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people were able to buy online, and that they could do it in any conditions, for example, sitting on the sofa.
But now it comes to the plateau and you can see a decline (growth).
The phenomenon of Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for slowing sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying on the eve of the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers in the amount of five times more average hurried to computers to have time to take advantage of the best offers, thus hitting a number of sales websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter a real battle for profitable purchases, could force people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a little more than 1 pound sterling out of each 5 is spent online.
As for such goods as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of them sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more readily than in fashion stores on the central streets.
Muslims bury those killed in the fall of the crane in Mecca, and sanctioned Ben Laden's family
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead in the streets, as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the accident
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapse
Hundreds of Muslims flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims who died as a result of the collapse of the crane on the main mosque of Mecca.
The young, mostly in the white, present at the funeral, filled the roadway to pay tribute to the first of the victims who went to their last journey to the Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad procession passed the sacred place, where just a few days earlier the construction crane struck the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were given for a funeral, and at the same time the King of Saudis fined the construction company belonging to the family of Ben Laden for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 parishioners who died at the collapse of the crane in the Main Mosque carried through the streets
Among the victims was the father of four children Kasim Akram from Bolton, Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque together with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajja.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman said that Binladin Group should not leave the crane boom raised at a non-working crane.
The Arabic version of the decree published by the state agency Saudi Press states that Binladin Group bears partial guilt for the collapse.
The English editorial office of the news agency did not tell about this detail, but reported that the company's leaders were banned from traveling outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the fall of the crane in the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go to the Hajj.
Binladin Group has not made any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of non-use of modern security measures and improper coordination of actions with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of large-scale construction works conducted by Binladin Group.
For decades, the bin Laden family has been among the closest ruling family of Saudi Arabia and has been managing the largest construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda Osama bin Laden was a treason son, from whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in life for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about 174,000 pounds) to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount irreversibly hardened.
The rest of the victims will receive half of this amount.

They say the British put aside hammers and painters, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to perform work in the house
If you know how to handle a hammer or cleverly paint the walls, it seems that these days you are in the minority.
Because, according to the company owner B&Q, the British are increasingly hired master specialists to perform simple work at home.
Veronica Lori, CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a network of home management services, said that this trend is followed by a significant influx of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 screwfix stores specializing in products for craftsmen, and simultaneously close 60 stores-stores B&Q.
Ms. Laurie said that she would like to see more women in the B&Q stores staff, as eight out of ten decisions about shopping in the store are accepted by the representatives of the weak sex.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to her, it is impossible to ignore the latest demographic trends, characterized by the fact that the number of households, consisting of single women, who are more engaged in the arrangement of their homes than in the past.
Mrs. Laurie said, "Our stores still have predominantly men.
It is necessary to take steps towards achieving balance.
In general, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the decisions on purchased goods are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laurie, one of the five women at the helm of leading British companies, whose shares are taken into account in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top managers" team, having achieved an equal number of men and women among directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including the CEO and the financial director.
Ms. Laurie said, "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
It was easy to find suitable women on the board of directors.
After the group assumed the cost of closing stores, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales for six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Time of decision-making on the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching the meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which discusses the adoption of the most important decision within two days - to raise the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists, conducted by Reuters, revealed that a little more than half of those who believed that the Federal Reserve would do so, now believe that it will still time and keep the rate at the level of the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as seven years have passed since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time we approach the fact that the main bank can move from zero and start the process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a leading employee of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The U.S. economy works effectively, the economic growth adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the federal reserve cannot ignore the way the decision will affect the world economy.
He warned the markets that it is necessary to prepare for the changes, but everything speaks of their confidence that all the chances against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" - hundreds of refugees are chanting at the Jorgosh checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
From Tuesday Budapest blocked the border for immigrants.
The asylum seekers are already beginning to probe other variants of routes to the European Union.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
The other - through Croatia and Slovenia - to Austria.
According to some reports, the buses that brought refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shid on the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered from the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojs Stepanovic assures that his country is doing everything to help refugees, but its possibilities are limited:
Our work is to protect Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, ensure a humane attitude towards them.
But this is a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve it, no country in Europe alone will not cope with it, and especially such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open a border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban is adamant:
If someone is called a refugee, he must fill in the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he does not do so, he will not be allowed to enter our country, because it is safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already built 175-meter fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to build the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that it is incompatible with European principles.
Wangelis Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
For a number of years, Vangelis Meimarakis has been a member of the centre-right governments, which, according to the left, have led the country to the financial crisis.
Now, having become the temporary leader of the New Democracy party, he defies Tsipras.
A few days before the elections he met with the journalist of Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for your invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago your party was defeated by losing to Syriza coalitions, but now, judging by the polls, the New Democracy was equal to it in popularity.
What has changed during this time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and we too.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
Now the country again has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras drove them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare the promised with what really happened.
Everyday life has become much worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and this was related to the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that in case of victory in elections you will strive for unions with other parties, including Syriza.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The point is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece can not move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where salvation programs have been or still operate, political forces and all ruling parties were going to implement a program by which they reached agreement without refusing their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only cooperation between political forces and institutions will allow the country to go forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in support of the agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you fulfill this agreement, or will you try to change it at least partly?
Wangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted for the Greek movement along the European path, because we are well aware of the disastrous consequences of the country's withdrawal from the EU.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, Junker's package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would be lost if there had been no agreement with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Tsipras negotiating.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government wants to restore order during the first year, the authorities are working rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then I am sure that all the commitments that cannot be fulfilled due to the fact that they lead to recession, can again become a subject of negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of the new agreement we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect the agreement to be fully implemented.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue to privatize, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed, continuing to enjoy the benefits of EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we need to open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the talks, the government of Tsipras did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found out, discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give an example related to the income of farmers.
We explained to our European partners that it is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the ministers of Tsipras had never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and poorly informed, and therefore unsuccessfully negotiated and concluded an unsuccessful agreement.
Euronews: If you win the elections, you will soon find yourself at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will it be different what you will tell them from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014 we tried to fulfill the 2012 agreement in the best way, bypassing the sharp corners in it.
We have pushed forward reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extreme circumstances.
The market fell, and there was no visible potential buyers ready to pay the price that suited the Greek government.
At that time I was the speaker of the Parliament, I managed to agree on the opinions of the three parliamentary groups that then constituted the governmental majority.
Despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, and this is in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations held outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation, which would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by early general elections, which became the result of the December presidential elections.
Euronews: The last weeks in Greece is moving a mass flow of refugees.
What do you think about this situation and the reaction of European countries to which these people seek?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with after the election victory.
And the reason is that the Syriza government did not act in this situation as it should.
In such matters, one should act ahead, because if the problem comes to you, only emergency measures remain.
And now we are in such a situation.
Even the temporary government that replaced Syriza did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the interim government, which is provided with valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will allow to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and notice - refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some emergency events that took place with them.
This issue has a deeply humanitarian aspect, and we will hold on to the position that European politicians should accept in this new situation.
The United Nations should also be involved in the EU summit.
We also need better coordination of actions, more effective border controls and refugee reception centers.
We must also effectively use the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this urgent problem.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.

The man who opened the shooting at the University of Delta left a note with apologies
After shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he fired and killed his colleague later on the same day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note that he "sorry" about the first murder and would like to "recover everything back," the authorized authorities reported on Tuesday.
Police in the city of Gaultier, Mississippi, reports that the teacher of geography and social sciences at the University of Delta, called the service 911 about 10 am.
On Monday, and reported that he had shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police had to send people to his home.
He said, "Yesterday evening I killed my wife," and also mentioned that there was a "pisher" in the house, which "which will not touch," but probably upset.
The police asked the name of the caller, but he did not name him.
The Lamb did not explain why he had opened fire.
Arriving at the crime scene, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41 years old, and a note written by hand from Lamb, 45 years, in which it was said: "I regret I would like to return everything back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Itan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday evening, when he was surrounded by the police, he was killed.
University Rector William Laforge said that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb's Lamb had something on his mind."
Despite the information received on Monday that Lamb assumed a novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, the official services on Tuesday reported "the absence of any information or evidence" of the "love triangle."
The Prentiss responded as a "good man" by Sean O'Stin, who reported that he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Stin said that he and Prentiss have a daughter, who is 19, and that she is "sotheless."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Noulz, whom the newspaper "San Gerald" calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Noulz said that Prentiss had a hunting dog called Lightning, and that she had met Lamb for about three years.
Noulz said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, on Monday at some point Lamb called his relatives to say that "he will not go to prison."
In the evening of the same day, when the police overtoo him on the 1 highway near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot there.
According to the resume posted on the university website, in the spring of 2015, Lamb received a doctorate in the field of pedagogy at the University of Delta.
Stars who have lost their luck
The actor (left), in a photo with his son Redmond (right), has experienced several difficult years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term companion of Farra Fosett, who died of cancer.
As reported, the actor also suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All this certainly played a role.
Luke Show from Manchester United was eliminated for several months due to a double fracture
Luc Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champions League match, in which Manchester United lost PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about this, because of which he will not be able to enter the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that the show will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during the reckless roll of Hector Moreno in the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Show burst into the PSV penal zone.
He was helped on the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before taking him to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He has a double fracture, and he is in the hospital."
It will be moved to Manchester tomorrow or afternoon, and then operated.
It's awful - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and began to play fantastically, and then it happened.
In the locker room there was an oxygen mask on it.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months and the guy will not be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he will be able to play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and was not awarded a penalty.
Arbitr Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gal believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad roll from two legs.
On his twitter, Shou writes: "Thank you all for your messages, words not to describe how I am devastated, my way to recovery begins, I will come back even stronger than it was."
More on the topic: Manchester United is experiencing a misfortune with Luke Shaw when defeated in the game with PSV
The British defender will have an additional incentive to recover to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cook, PSV coach, said: "This is a very severe injury."
When any player with such an injury is out of such an injury, everyone is very upset by this.
This has never been the intention of our players to hurt the opponent.
Moreno suffered a fracture of his leg when playing for Mexico against the Dutch team under the leadership of Van Gal at the World Cup in 2014.
"It is very difficult for him now, because he had no intention of hurting the enemy, and when you hear that it is a very severe injury, you feel bad," said Koku.
I didn't have the opportunity to see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see is the ball that flew in the other direction, so it looked like he (Sea) touched him, but I did not see a roll under Luca.
In an interview with SBS6 Moreno said: "I know what it is, I know how difficult it is to carry it.
I am very hard, and I'm very sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Lorax?
Each parent quickly masters one thing: if your child liked some book, it will take a little time before you get to know it almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you are David Cameron.
Answering the question of the representative of the company involved in the organization of children's recreation during the holidays, about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "Lorax" - a fairy tale with an environmental bias, written by D-r Suze in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment published on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "This cheerful, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children, because it always reveals some image or message that we miss."
And everything would be fine, except the last paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to retold the contents of the book, but actually tells the plot of the film of the same name, filmed in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify a rather short original narrative.
"In the city of Vomnuzhville surrounded by high walls, where there was no greenery and even the air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - a girl of his dreams, fulfilling her desire to see the real tree," - we read in the text a description of love history, unknown to the du-ru Suzu (real name of Theodore Suze Geysel), who died in 1991.
If it looks insufficiently suspicious, Cameron's text reads almost as a brief statement of the plot of the movie "Lorax," posted on the website of the Internet Movie Database: "In the city surrounded by high walls, where everything was artificial and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - girls of his dreams dream.."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being, by general recognition, an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book, in which the boy who is not named after the name of the boy learns about how the greedy cutter of trees and the knitter of "all-no-noon" Nakhodkins, despite the protests of Loraks (whose name is given to the name of the book) - a ridic creature with the names of the trees.
Most likely, such a simple PR task was entrusted to the performer who never read the child's book about Loraks 20 times in a row.
The Downing Street representative said that the text was supposedly received from Cameron's office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameron's headquarters, but there were no further comments.
For Adam Lita clearly there was a risk not to get into the national team of England, but it is still a difficult question
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you look at the national team that England selected for this tour, the repetition of the defeat in the test series with the score of 3-0, which happened last time, does not seem to me probable.
I would also not exclude victory in my field.
The team of Aleister Cook is perhaps less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but there are players among the beaten off, virtuoso taking twisted balls, and collective thinking strongly; they will not bring scars from 2012, but only youthful positive.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into a bouler, leading the ball, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
More on the topic: Adam Lit was eliminated from England on test cricket and replaced by Alex Heilz
The decision to exclude Adam Lit, his head coach in Yorkshire, is of course difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and obvious, but the cruel reality is that the players in cricket are evaluated by the judges by the result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've already said it before) players choose themselves best.
A couple of half-sots, and Lita could wait for a longer career, but he was in the power of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
The head coach of England, Trevor Baileiss, spoke well about his attitude, even when he did not show what he was capable of, and it does not surprise me; he is primarily a team player, and then everything else.
The question is how long it will take before the Batsman of the test cricket leaves an impression of himself - a difficult question.
Lit played seven games, just like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton played in nine games.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on someone else's field.
The only thing you might have to complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in the best form, but that lost opportunity in the past.
Alex Hals appears, and he is a Batsman, whom I appreciate high.
He is an unpredictable cricketist that we saw at the Yorkshire club at the beginning of this season, when he earned 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should be at least given the same opportunity as those who were before him, but it will certainly depend on the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as a opening Batsman, which would allow an additional spinner, saving four high-speed boulevers, thinking about it, and I'm not against it at all.
I see no reason why the beating player can not beat the ball there, and this leftover has already shown that he is a damn good cricket player.
Moen may not be quite what you need for your county Wustershire, but became the third number for them, and there is no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches "third of the Batsman" before leaving as opening in 2001.
He won three hundred at once and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the national team as a back-up spinner, and with my brief communication with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his approximate statistics - an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball - and think that it is a risky bet, but among spinners voting "for a little" and selects chose youth.
He will learn a lot in this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayauordin, the shri-lanx of Batsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a master move.
He is one of the best guys for the game, who will bring her the richest experience gained under all possible conditions and in any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is involved in the games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and merciless pace in the setup.
I always felt that he was born in order to be involved in international cricket, whether it's a game or coaching, and, like Mahela, has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has already been said before, can give new strength to the team.
Colleague of the team of Durham Ben Stokes left for one day, Ruth is given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, do not experience problems about this.
Although not everyone will agree with this, the coaches and the players who select the players do not determine the schedule.
And you must remember how players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never made easily.
UK exit supporter camp from the European Union can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's unthinkable policy on resuming negotiations on Britain's preservation in the EU is increasingly difficult every day, even without looking back at the election of the genius Jeremy's "This is yes or not?" - Corbin is the leader of the Laborers or the resentment of TUC about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Paraji.
The Friendly European diplomat explained the other day that, despite the situation in which the EU is now experiencing various crises - not all of them own manufacture - some of the participating countries are satisfied on the throat of the British egocentric agenda of concessions and undermining the agreements of changes, which they mostly do not want.
Having gathered in Brighton for the annual meeting, TUC decided that he did not want them anyway if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "the selfie of Dageva and George."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance ride on summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the background of a famous local monument, in the company of local celebrities or without it, then come home and say that they attract allies for reform.
That's all about me.
My European friend who wants to support Britain's external contacts under the European Union's shadow - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin, suggests that the stuck ministers and officials in some capitals reach their understanding when they still become, we will stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's very cautious Chancellor, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation for her deteriorates, as she deteriorated for the Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterran (14) and Kolia (16).
The head of France Francois Hollande stands before the re-election or replacement in 2017.
He also loses power.
Poland may soon get a nationalist right-wing government, Spain - the left.
It is hard to see them out of skin to help the "selphi-brits," whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from the UK - what they do not want, because the majority has similar separatist trends.
So some such ministers can even plan to issue deliberately useless SNP-style SNP-style Remarques during a referendum campaign in the UK in 2017 to boost the process of British withdrawal from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The reconcite was the idea-fix" and "Britain did not receive anything valuable from the renewed negotiations."
Europeans know what kind of predator Flit Street can be, and how skeptical about the EU media magnates are, unlike the time of Tony Benno's referendum launched in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 by the ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, an entrenched Euro-opportunist, who was famous for his "direct bananas of the EU" of the Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a colorful company of tax-thousands, telephone hackers-chuzhakov and pseudo-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was of them quite the same opinion, but he was aware that when you were in a cage with a turbulent gorilla, you had to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and once again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was a greater adherent to Blair than Blair himself in confronting the idea of Cameron about the referendum, as Blair acted in favor of the abolished EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who issued him a winning ticket.
The press did not forgive him anything of it.
But the mile of Jeremy Corbin, who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he had no time to spend it on me - it looks like Neil Kinnok's strategy "boytoo" of the 80s - a mistake then, and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press - not with me, but quite accurately with Andrew Marrom, on whose couch in the Air Force he sat on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says that he would like us to stay in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the Ukip and a wider range of "next England's supporters" among tory can probably say "yes."
It's the same thing that Hillary-"Benn, but not Benn,"-Benn said on the radio and TV this week, while his inner boycotted with all his might refused to admit that Corbin's appointment of John McDonnell's "shadow" minister of finance was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 70s, when his old-fashioned-fat fought hard on TV for dissatisfying to colleagues in the labor department, not going too far and without losing his post in the Cabinet of Ministers.
The Battle of Hillary was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "under any circumstances" - Benn's phrase is not what McDonnell said, and not what J. K. told the Pairs and the members of the parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, in general opinion.
Whatever the democrat and his boyfriend, Corbin, remember, he touched me even - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of around the clock television seven days a week, and especially in the whirlpool of social networks, the hearth of paranoia and betrayal.
It is reasonable not to let Cameron get rid of Europe so easily, allowing him to accept as due support of the laborers during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But the main misconception of McDonnell and Corbin on membership in the EU - within the framework of the "bennithic" economy of the besieged fortress - is no longer a question of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for which nadcissism, given by insignificant differences, is the central principle in pre-warm disputes.
As for his misconceptions about Nato - Tom Watson is unshakable that G.K. will not agitate for the exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey it to their leaders at home.
Why does Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to concessions to Britain, when it can be pointless?
The U.S. is already disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the government tori in power cuts costs, as I was reminded on Monday during a lunch forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
The agency's statements by the government that 95% less harmful than smoking were 95% less harmful than smoking, 12 people, some of whom are related to the tobacco industry, according to the researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published an important report - a "turning milestone" last month, calling it a "all-round review of the evidence."
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial article in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized "extremely shaky argument," on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two more researchers wondered whether these statements had "hard or slang up."
Martin McKee, professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capwell, a clinical epidemiology teacher at Liverpool University, said: "The fundamental principle of health - the rules should be based on proof of efficiency."
According to them, the public expects the statements of PHE that "the current best assessment shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking" were based on detailed analysis of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this is displayed from the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-criteria model of decision-making in order to summarize their opinions about the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are briefly cited in a scientific publication.
McKie and Keipwell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported earlier that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also confirmed BAT health certificates in the sustainability report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, not mentioning the funding he was previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the choice of the members of the Board, but among them there are several well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which also announced the financing of the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also visited by the head of the tobacco direction in PHE.
The scientific article published by the group "susually agrees" that there is a lack of "the hanging evidence of the harmful effects of most products according to most criteria," McKie and Capwell wrote.
However, none of these links and restrictions were affected in the PHE report.
McKie and Capewell said that PHE statements that "there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive or smoking to smoking" are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being in PHE, said that BMJ's statements had already been answered.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking."
One of the two smokers died of his predilection all his life.
All evidence implys that the health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote consequences.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what they prove and what these evidences do not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger in comparison with tobacco.
About 80,000 people die of smoking-related diseases per year, and smoking costs NHS at 2 billion pounds a year.
Clearly denoting the obvious - that although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they cause only part of the harm caused by smoking - we perform our tasks before the nation.
Former Channel 4 CEO believes BBC should stop EastEnders
Former head of Channel 4 Luc Johnson believes that BBC should stop the release of programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their competitors in business would have much to give for such successful shows as the soap opera about "Ploshchad Alberta."
Johnson noted that the license fees should only be used to create programs that are not produced by other British TV and radio companies.
He criticized BBC for launching public broadcasting programs, which are probably watching only a small part of the audience, at peak airtime, when competitors have high rating shows and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had been unsuccessfully trying to establish cooperation with BBC during his work on Channel 4.
"I can't get rid of the idea that BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast programs that could show competing companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told the members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of the BBC's further fate.
If you keep the license fee, that I do not consider a good solution in the medium and long term, the company should leave on air only those programs that are not produced and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice's show is aired in prime-sel, because the creators want to get the most possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would show it is rid from, rid from it and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should be funded by programs that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is well known that they are their own production.
Other channels would certainly give much for it.
I don't understand how it can be public broadcasting.
I don't think it would somehow lower the BBC.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing the ratings "due to the ambitions of the employees and because of their belief that it is the best way to get support for a long time."
His comments about the most popular show on the BBC echo with the comments of Sky CEO Tony Bolla, who in his lecture in memory of McTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003 offered BBC to sell TV series such as EastEnders.
Johnson noted that the niche programs of the BBC of the public character "continue to go to the BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audience, but the function of the company is fulfilled, and this can be presented as an argument in the Hange sermons justifying the income from the license fees of 4 billion pounds: "Well, of course, we do all these incomprehensible programs that no one looks at."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
Johnson told the committee about the license fee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system as regards who will receive the most from it.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds a year - a huge amount, but for people for whom 150 pounds - a lot of money, I wonder, they think so because they do not watch and listen to the BBC.
David Elstein, former executive director of Sky and Channel 5, who also spoke to the committee last Tuesday, said that BBC should revise Rita's mission in favor of "inform, educate and entertain."
He noted that now only a small part of the materials produced by BBC is formally classified as educational - according to him, it is 1% of TV content and 0.1% on the radio - and that the company should pick up the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasting companies under the motto "inform, educate and entertain."
For partnership issues Elstein noted that BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "Promenade Concerts" (only some of them, according to him, are shown on TV), as well as to join alliances with commercial broadcasting companies to make them available for viewing online.
"Singogenetics" allows you to control brain cells with sound waves
The video shows how the neuromatoes change the direction of movement at the moment when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have brought worms with a genetically modified nervous system, which can be controlled using pulses of sound waves.
Tinye nomatods change the direction of movement at the moment when they are influenced by sound impulses, too high, so that the human ear can hear them.
Pulse has an effect by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
More on the topic: Researchers manage brain activity with the help of light
Scientists said that worms demonstrate the possibility of a new technique called "sonogenetics," the essence of which is the use of ultrasound to arouse certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Sricant Chalasani, a researcher at the Institute of Solka, La Joy, California, told Guardian that this technique could once replace the deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which the human brain is sent electric impulses and which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Worms-nately do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles enhance the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the body of the worms.
The strengthened ultrasonic waves affect the structures called "TRP-4 ion channels," detected in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves make these Ionic channels open and excited the cells that are associated with them, according to the report in Nature Communications.
To create a nematod that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of worms, so their motor neurons used ion channels TRP-4.
During the use of ultrasound for the impact on modified organisms, the sound waves were enhanced by microscopic bubbles and induced into the organisms of worms, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light impulses.
Chalasani claims that in comparison with this method of sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the desired area of the brain by fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves pass through the tissues of the body without hindrance, so for their delivery you do not need to pass inside the skull box.
"We believe that for the treatment of some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to make human neurons sensitive to ultrasound signal for a time," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-procedive cells.

Advertising ads bullying British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International video protesting against the arms exhibition.
Stunning killer drones!
Destructive shin iron shackles!
Cassette bombs!
Electric light-noise clubs that cause unbearable pain, but do not leave traces!
A slanderous voice and drawn animation leave no doubt that this advertising of the largest international armament exhibition is a caustic parody prepared by Amnesty International in order to draw attention to the intention of the British government to push weapons to repressive regimes, using the exhibition of defense technologies and security systems taking place in the center of ExCeL in Doclande.

But a special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and in subway trains that require to look at them again.
"The important announcement traveling along the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" - is written on one of them in London's fonts with the image of the DLR line, turning into a silhouette of a tank.
In September this year, a crowd of arms dealers will come to the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help interfere with the exhibition of weapons.
300 posters are drawn by artists who have exhibited their works at the "Museum of Cruise Design" in Banksy Park "Dismaland."
The team called the Group "special patrol" helped to spread them to London, using "a set of cracker advertising places," a 6-pound set of wrenches, which, as stated, "gives access to about a third of the advertising space at the bus stops of the planet."
London's transporters did not have fun of such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Group "special patrol."
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and teacher at Essex University, artists become more demanding and seek to convey political art to the audience outside the galleries.
Many artists start working with protest activists, realizing that they have to go to the real world for their art, if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the exhibition of weapons, welcoming passengers in the subway.
The video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by VCCP, working pro bono, with the involvement of graphic designer and sounder, also working for free.
The creative director of the VCCP, Matt Lever, was amazed by the advertising silence around the arms exhibition - with the pass in the ExCel calendar, and thought, "Let's arrange for them a campaign they try to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and cunning corporate advertising, but "to fill it with bright colors and animation turned out to be a more exciting activity."
"They have helped us to attract attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davis from Amnesty.
Now we need the British government to take action and guarantee that this torture equipment will not be illegally sold right at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art on the theme of the armament exhibition goes from inside ExCeL, where participants sell fantastically ewfeyse products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed the information about the order on "AT4CS RS for shooting from the shoulder," received from the U.S. Army.

Eight gold rules of residence in student hostels
Already 11 years have passed since I moved to a student hostel as a normal 19-year-old, still believe in berets and moral relaivism, but only now I remember the strained smiles of those whom I irritated - and numerous, long complaints against others.
Basically, what I have learned can be laid out according to eight simple rules.
Moving to the hostel can vary from slightly acting on the nerves to absolutely frightening.
He encourages people to talk: to tell people where you came from, whether you took an academic vacation and where it was spent, whether you support Corbin and why you "honestly, neither I love, nor hate Maright," because, seriously, guys, it's just a hawkin's yeast extract, I'll be at home."
Oversee.
And help others rest too - ask questions and demonstrate interest.
This supports the conversation and helps you to search for people you like, not those with whom you would not even talk, even if you had caught eyelashes, and they would hand out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into pubs, midnight cinemas and common parties, but they are also the place where people dress up and correct underwear.
More on the topic: Do not even think to start studying at the university, being in a relationship
Introverts at universities are unfair.
Your room should be a refuge, but many hostels form a culture of shaping from one room to another, which contributes to friendship, communication and leads to long friendly relations.
It can be hell for the one who tries to restore strength.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "You like me, and I want to keep friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I can recover the energy I spent on communicating with you."
I make a sense of feeling when the fellow student is tired of communication - and not knocking on him, but send SMS.
By the way, about knocking: do it.
One guy in my hostel followed this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Plants of friends with baking.
Since you start university life at the peak of the popularity of the show Bake-Off, knocking on the door to people to introduce and present a plate of chocolate cookies - no longer such a strange action, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we are neighbors, I have something baked for you, and now smile, and I will ask you personal questions."
Offer home treats - a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to chat with you, and in the end, probably your face will be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are.
Poorly blinded lumber of flour, sugar and fat will rather make people pretend to be sleeping when you knock at them.
Food theft is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, the assignment of someone's chicken - theft, but is it theft - to take a little milk for tea?
To cope with the owner of milk.
Most likely, he will offer you not to be embarrassed, even if he boils inside with fury.
If someone steals your things, it irritates, and I sympathize with you - but try to treat this older than my neighbor, who poured into his milk a liquid for washing dishes to take revenge to those who took him without demand.
Now she is in prison.
You don't have to make a noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the saying about the glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked her neighbor to reduce the sound of the drum and bass guitar, as it was 3 o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally paused at 5 a.m., she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours, and then chopped her music and locked the door behind her, going to the three-hour exam.
Was it not romantic if your future wife settled in the same hostel as you?
On the contrary, it would not be extremely, to the biting of the elbows, clumsy, if you had accepted the neighbor for your future spouse, became carried away by them, torn the relationship, and would have to see him every day, and perhaps observe how he pulls all of your common friends to his side?
Of course, you will not give your heart - but if the hot neighbor is not your future husband, try to cool your own ardour slightly.
At the exciting moment when you realize that someone left the keys inside his own locked room, the line between raffle and harassment is thinner than it seems.
A good draw is fun, but turns into its opposite in seconds.
Give a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never pack someone's room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
After the alien door and drop the keys into a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not stick other people's things with Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than two times.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on iPhone after Apple Updates Release
The new operating system can be requested by entering the Settings application, select General, and then - Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download it and install.
Some encountered problems after installation, when an error message that speaks to them that "The app renewal failed."
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the revival subsides, or try to update via iTunes.
The help of the phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may include deleting applications to increase free space - but Apple minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and also simplified the execution using a special utility that offers to uninstall applications and re-install them after the completion of the process.
It is worth making sure that when the update your phone is charged or is next to the charger to prevent the discharge of the battery.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the phone discharge in the process can cause a remediation failure.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone calls.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support Moscow provides to President Assad leads only to the escalation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about this with his Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by the publication PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry made it clear that the further support of President Assad from Russia creates a risk of aggravation and prolongation of the conflict, as well as negatively affects our common goal - the fight against extremism - if we do not continue to concentrate on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict by direct transfer of power," the U.S. Department of State said.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the commitment of the United States to fight the "Islamic state" within a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be able to be a member of it.
In addition, the United States "will be happy with Russia's constructive role in attempts to counter ISIS."
Last Friday, the White House representatives said that they did not know exactly what actions the Russian troops are taking in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, White House spokesman Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will raise the pipe and try to make this call."
Barack Obama considers Russia's decision to increase the support of the Assad regime by a "losive bet."
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that it was a mistake that the further support of Assad would only worsen the situation.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and as a result the situation worsened," the US President said.
The imported yachts will be exempted from paying customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports from paying customs duties and taxes.
Relevant changes in the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported by "Izvestia" Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Lashkina.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev on the basis of a trip to the Crimea instructed a number of agencies - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Customs Service - to prepare proposals for creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete absence of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about € 200 million annually go to the treasury of European countries for maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On Amendments to the List of Goods temporarily imported with a full conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties, taxes," providing for the provision of a full conditional exemption from the payment of customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports.
According to the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, - said Lashkina.
This issue was submitted for consideration by the subcommittee on customs-tariff, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade of the Government Commission for Economic Development and Integration, which was held in September, and following the results of the discussion, was also approved by the departments.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure for full conditional release when importing is essentially a privilege.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will make a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission to discuss with the member states of the EAEU, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from the payment of customs duties, taxes, includes the goods necessary to assist foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for application in the field of science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, for the provision of international assistance, etc. Among them - service equipment (personal computers, writing machines), control and measuring devices, drilling equipment, stage costumes, costumes and decorations, motorcycles, sports and decorations, motorcycles, and sports shops, sports and sports shops, motorcycles, and sports shops, sports cars, and sports cars, sports shops, sports and decorations, sports cars, and sports cars, and sportswear, sports and sports equipment, sports and sports shops, and sports equipments, and sports equipments, and sports shops, sports and sports shops, sports and sports shops, sports and sports equipment, sports and sports equipments, sports and motorcycles, and motorcycle machines, sports and sports shops, sports and sportswear, sports and sportswear, motorcycles, and sportswearing machines, sports and sportswear, motorcycles, sports and sportswear, motorcycles and sportswearers, sportswears, motorcycles and sportswearing machines, sportswearing, sports and sports equipment, motorcycles and sportswear, motorcycles and sports, sports and sports equipment, motorcycles and sportsmen's, sports and sports equipment, motorcycles
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation "Izvestia" told that they prepared mandatory decrees on the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for registration of the call and exit of small, sports sailing and walking ships to the sea port.
The Ministry of Transport instructed the captains of the seaports of Crimea to ensure the use of the simplified procedure for entering small, sports sailing and walking ships to the sea port and exit of the listed ships from the sea port.
Also, the Ministry of Transport prepared draft decrees of the Government of the Russian Federation on approval of the boundaries of the sea ports of Crimea.
In relation to Yalta and Feodosia orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the stage of coordination, - noted in the press service of the agency.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the State Supervision, Classification and Testing, State Register against Small Courts Used for Non-Profit Purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look to the south of Italy and France, there is a whole constantly developing industry, which involves a large number of people.
In Russia, in fact, everything stands still.
Our coast is of little interest, the only piece where you can operate yachts all year round - this Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the great difficulty is that in this area extremely strict rules of the border service: in order to go on a trip on the yacht, you need to issue a lot of permits.
In addition, inside Russia, there is nowhere to refleate the yacht.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then there is a problem where to take it, - says the sales director of Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
As for the places for the storage of yachts, in Moscow and St. Petersburg now there are special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. Also, yachts are sent to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that the buyers of yachts are rich people, but with the beginning of the crisis the demand for yachts has decreased.
The World Bank has allocated a $500 million loan to Ukraine.
The World Bank approved a new $500mn loan project for Ukraine for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"The New funding will support a number of priority measures to implement reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the message reads.
Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Tsimiao Fan said that the banking sector reforms will help to revive loans in the real economy and will stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank observe the first signs of stabilization.
But due to the seriousness of the problems, Fans urges the Ukrainian government to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved the grant of a loan of € 100 million to Ukraine, "RIA Novosti" reports.
In prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgenders.
The Public Council under the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicted offenders in October 2015 will discuss the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transvestites in colonies.
Member of the Council Vladislav Grib told Izvestia about this.
In his opinion, depending on the total number of convicted convicted people who have not decided on the floor, in domestic prisons it is possible to provide separate cameras, blocks, or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future to create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to determine the punishment of citizens in such isolated places only after the convicted pass appropriate medical examinations, which prove that the offender is really a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is sure that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving punishment.
According to him, the proposed practice successfully operates abroad: in pre-trial detention (where the defendants are before the court decision) separate cameras for transgenders are provided, and in correctional institutions - special blocks.
Today it is the only way out when working with such criminals.
Definitely they need to be isolated, as the presence of transvestites and transgender in ordinary cameras is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a lot of problems for the FSIN staff.
The humiliation of trances from the part of the cameramen are guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big a city, how many criminals with indefinite sex, you need to count where to distribute them.
Some of them are definitely not necessary - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgenders.
As Mushroom explained, the block may contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps is created in Russia alone, transsexuals will be able to enter prison from any region.
Citizens are kept in pre-trial detention at the place of committing a crime, so the receipts of transvestites or transgenders from other subjects in the course of investigation and trial are unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, says Grib.
Recall that on the eve of the law enforcement officers could not decide in which investigative insulator - male or female - to determine the detained for possession of drugs 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov (known under the name of Alina Davis), because of which a man with a girl's appearance was not arrested.
He was released home under the subscription for no-show.
This news was widely discussed in social networks and the media, as there is really no mechanism for keeping transgenders in pre-trial detention and colonies in Russia.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT movement activist (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolai Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for serving punishment by transgenders, noting that abroad it is also possible to determine people in a penal colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of providing security in prisons for homosexuals, - says Alekseev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be done in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially since they are in prisons more than transgenders.
At the same time, Alekseev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are ready to pretend to be a transcexual in order to get into a different from the usual colony.
Of course, it is possible to introduce medical examination before placing people in a colony for transgenders, but not always everything is unique.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners Chelsea Menning looked like a man, and already in prison said he wanted to change the floor, - said Alekseev.
A person can feel himself by anyone.
But as long as there are no separate places for serving the punishment for transgenders, I doubt that the prison staff will seriously think about the safety of such people and understand the subtleties of their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, Boris Lordkipanidze, an international expert on reproductive health issues on the territory of the Russian Federation, noted that the introduction of a new system of distribution of transsexual criminals in the colony can severely delay the beginning of serving of punishment to convicted offenders.
A commission is being created - it is a question of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, it is not one test, on the basis of which a high-precision conclusion is made.
Today's psychiatry capabilities allow this.
Therefore, before the change of sex potential patients always undergo such examinations - they show exactly whether sex change with surgery is the necessary measure, - says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to introduce this system against the convicted, because on average, such examination takes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general, the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals supported, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it will be expedient to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical expertise - transgenders in Russia units.
It is difficult to count, there is no official statistics, but if we take into account that about 5% of homosexuals in Russia, we can say that there are even fewer transgenders, and those who have such deviation and also commit crimes, a small number, - said Lordkipanidze.
Now, upon request of the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgenders can get separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior World Chess Championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk, the World Chess Championship among juniors has ended.
The ending of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and became them Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to catch up with the Pole Jan-Kshishtof Dudu, who seems to be confident to the title.
The girls celebrated the victory Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buxa.
The World Chess Championship, held since the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, by the middle of the tournament distance, it seemed that it seemed to have lost almost the entire intrigue, because the representative of Poland Jan-Kshishtof Duda, who issued a series of four victories (competitions are held in the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently captured the lead.
Given that Duda was a favorite rating of the championship, and in general is considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he would miss the gap, seemed very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the gap to only 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov, to catch up with the leader, it was necessary to win in the 13th round.
But even this would not help, win Dud's party.
In addition, this obligatory victory, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to optional mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he had to wait for his party to finish Dud, who met Benjamin Boc.
Fortunately for Antipov Polish chess player brought the confrontation with the Dutch draw.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
That is why the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, whose governor Natalia Komarova, traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, presented the main prize.
But in the competition girls intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalia Buquez (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the last round, that she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Bux.
Russian athlete remained second with a lag from the champion in 0.5 points.

Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Yevtukhov said that the program of targeted food assistance will not be an analogue of the card system of food distribution, which existed in the USSR.
We are talking about modern targeted food assistance to the population and support of effective domestic producers.
I ask you not to speculate on the phrase "food card."
I would like to note that it is not necessary to confuse the proposed grocery cards with the easing of the past times total deficit, card distribution system, in which the number of products received is normal.
We have so far proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose amendments to the legislation," TASS quotes Mr. Yevtukhov.

Comfortable rate for investment loan - 10-13%.
According to experts, the lending market of small and medium-sized businesses in January-April this year sank by 40%.
What, according to your estimates, is the situation today?
After panic sentiments of the end of 2014 - beginning of 2015, SME lending volumes declined significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Lending under 25-30% per annum was not profitable to anyone.
If earlier the bank could put into an increased rate all its possible problems in the future, from delays to non-returns, now it is impossible to do: rates and so sky-high.
For business, the current level of rates on SME loans is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.
The rate level of 10-13% would allow the business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive profitability on them.
How much, according to your estimates, is the demand of entrepreneurs for loans satisfied?
After the Central Bank lowered the interest rate, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less frequently.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects of its development and future revenues.
Today, the business has one way out: it is necessary to learn how to work, focusing on today's economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more carefully, to control the movement of money.
At the same time, in the presence of financial resources, it is necessary to use new technologies to modernize the equipment, reduce production and energy supply costs.
All this, ultimately, allows the company to make the products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends of the SME lending market and will affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for the reduction of the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator demonstrates consistency in reducing the key rate.
However, the price of loans for SMEs should not be expected to radically fall.
In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes the necessary increased interest rate to generate real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even when the Central Bank rates are reduced.
If we talk about the level of delay, traditionally small and medium-sized businesses, limited both in the possibilities of replenishment of cash, and in the options for correcting economic behavior, will certainly be a greater risk for creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written by Japanese hieroglyphs.
Beautiful, concise and at the same time quite difficult for those who are used to Cyrillic or Latin.
So the new crossover CX-5, as, indeed, and any other model of the brand: without fever attractive outside, technically perfect inside.
The Japanese is simply due to its "Japanese" able to bring the attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of full delight.
You can give any arguments in favor of cars from other countries, and the person even in principle with these arguments will agree, but the conversation will fall from the final phrase: "But it's a Japanese car!
So there is nothing to argue about!
Such people probably should love not only the technique, but everything else Japanese.
To quote with the move of Bass, to spit food with Vasabi, collect the katanas and dress your girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, and on the canons of street Japanese fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps the Japanese school uniform is the only form that girls wear with pleasure and after graduation.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the radiator grille with five horizontal lines.
But much more changes the appearance of the car a new picture of headlights and rear lights, on which the car is instantly recognized in the flow of cars.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very seductive.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but the appearance at the same time has a raid of rigor.
The police will not have to call.
Behind the wheel of the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can experience only stoic Japanese calmness.
The 2.2 l diesel engine provides a high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this motor with a capacity of 175 HP is only 5.9 liters. The power unit is equipped with an exclusively automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.
Black boots, black cloak, black bag...
To add a bit of black humor to this image, you can choose the leggings with the print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, Mazda made every effort to drive the CX-5 you are not in place of your own accident.
In order to further enhance comfort, while retaining excellent handling, the suspension has redesigned the design of front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the front lower levers.
The all-wheel drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and the engine at high speeds reduced by 13%.
Swimsuit in flowers or strips is as well as the budget sedan.
It's a different thing if a girl flaunts in a swimsuit with an original pattern.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of role-player fighter.
Attention then will get no less than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both front and rear seats, which provides an optimal space for both wide shoulders and long legs - who has something to do.
Even long-legged will surely appreciate the fact that the stops in front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not beat the ankles in the vibraes.
The widest set of active security systems Mazda is offered on the CX-5.
In order to recognize the potential threat, here are used radars, lasers and cameras.
There are also adaptive lighting, and warning about the convergence of the band, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
Convenient, having a minimum of pro-duts, it holds a load of 561 liters. The rear seats are folded in a ratio of 4:2:4 - each section is equipped with a separate lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 liters.
The costume of the cartoon hero in Japan is called "kigurumi."
Especially mad looks kergurumi-pizhama.
Everything is possible in it!
Of course, sleep.
But also - to entertain small children.
Or just walking such an animal on the street...
After all, it is so great when there is an opportunity to choose - funny clothes, behavior or car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the material Kawaicat store.
Kiev broke the atomic sedsion.
Kiev officially issued a refusal of Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on completion of Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant.
On Wednesday, on the second attempt, the Verkhovna Rada still voted to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
The agreements on completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to start the implementation of the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law ceasing an agreement with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth block at Khmelnytsky NPP in 2010-2012.
The bill introduced by the government was held only from the second vote, for the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the necessary minimum of 226, but then 234 members of the Parliament voted for the project.
The Khmelnytsky NPP laid under the USSR under the original project was supposed to count four power units of 1 GW with VVER reactors, but managed to build only two.
Negotiations with Moscow on completion led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, in 2011-2012 the Rada passed the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the blocks would have to be built on the loan of the Russian side, but the funds were not allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to curtail relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing the refusal to cooperate in Khmelnytsky NPP and the project for the construction of a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where the relations remained, there were purchases of fuel in Russia for existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (proved about half of the power generation in the country), as so far the Ukrainian NAEC "Energoatom" has nothing to replace the Russian supply.
The plans for the completion of Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet finally refused: back in 2014 in Kiev announced negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.
The UN Secretary General is against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference that it is impossible to settle the situation in Syria by military means.
"There is no military solution," AP cites his answer to the question about the military support of Syria by Russia.
Ban Ki-moon also said that he will meet with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the Foreign Ministers of the permanent UN Security Council member states later this month.
"The meeting will be on Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not rule out the possibility of creating a base of the Air Force in Syria in the future.
So far, there are no such plans.
"But everything can be," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Earlier, "Kommersant" reported that the U.S. does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to official Damascus is necessary to fight against the Islamic State terrorist group banned in Russia.

The OSCE PA reports on a possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
Head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Arthur Gerasimov announced the possibility of a bilateral meeting with Russian colleagues-parliamentaries to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
"What I know is planned to have a certain meeting this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," TASS quotes Mr. Gerasimov.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and "to return to the normal life of our countries."
When asked whether, in his opinion, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level is possible - in the "Norman format" or in the format of a contact group at the platform of the OSCE PA - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was held, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the policy, Kiev supports any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the negotiations, former President Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics have not changed their positions in the trilateral negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Nizhny Novgorod election commission summed up the results of the city council elections in the municipal district, distributing 12 deputy seats played on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints were made against violations during the elections by CPRF representatives, who accused the election commission of "covering falsifications."
The opposition's remarks were not accepted.
At the same time, the election refused the "Communists of Russia" party to organize a referendum concerning the cancellation of the fee for the repair of multi-apartment buildings.
The city election commission officially presented the election results in the proud Nizhny Novgorod municipal electoral district.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the voter rolls in Nizhny Novgorod, 746,700 voters were issued ballot papers for voting in precinct commissions, and 268,000 voters voted at the elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were invalidated, and 24 - lost.
Yesterday, 12 seats were distributed among political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of United Russia, six Duma seats are relying on Dmitri Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupratov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR was given to party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Two CPRF mandates are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
Three Just Russia seats are given to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now these candidates must decide within five days whether they will work as deputies in the city Duma: in case of resignation, he will move to the next candidate on the party list.
Chairman of the City Election Commission Alexander Makeev told the members of the commission that he is on duty to "send the telegrams of Zhirinovsky and others" for the refusal of mandates.
When approving the protocol on election results, CPRF representatives announced multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the CPRF election commission with a consultative vote, proposed not to recognize the results of voting in four districts No. 21-24, reminding that by order of the head of the administration administration, the entrance to the administration building was closed, where four district commissions were located.
For a long time neither deputies of the State Duma, nor the candidates themselves, nor observers, and a resonant scandal with the assault on the doors of the regional administration was shown on television.
At the sessions of district commissions all observers and non-voting commission members were able to attend.
The head of the head stopped access only when the voting ended and the precinct commissions had not yet arrived to hand over their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
"The head was corrected, and interested persons could be present at all meetings," Natalia Andryushina, a member of the city election commission, parried.
The Communists objected that in the blocked building of the administration for more than four hours illegally held Ludmila Aristova, a deputy of the regional council, on which the application was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition also resented that in some UIK on election day they started sealing ballot boxes at 6-7 o'clock in the morning, posting in them ballots for early voting.
At the same time, no one has not been informed by non-voting members of the commissions and observers, so they have already come to the beginning of elections at 8 am.
The Communists are sure that in the morning hours before the opening of polling stations in the ballot boxes could be thrown into the ballot boxes uncontrollably.
However, the city election commission, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander Makeev, found no violations with the casts of unaccounted ballots.
The commission members did not support Maria Popova's proposal from Just Russia through the rapprochement to get out with amendments to the regional legislation in order to clearly determine the time of opening of envelopes with early voting ballots, which will then fall into the ballot box.
"As the order of your own initiative, please contact the CEC at least," advised Ms. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, CPRF member Sergei Samokhin attacked the chairman with loud accusations, shouting that the election ignores dozens of complaints and covers election frauds.
"You are not here at the meeting, cautiously declare!" - the chairman of the election commission was offended.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
Until September 27, the election commission should approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the city council of Nizhny Novgorod of the sixth convocation will be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to determining the election results, the city election commission refused the political party "Communists of Russia" to register an initiative group for a local referendum.
Judging by the documents, the party members were going to raise two questions for discussion: whether they agree that the fees for the repair of multi-apartment buildings should be "immediately canceled," and the tariffs for housing and communal services "freeze until 2020."
However, the Duma lawyer Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of the Communists of Russia is contrary to the legislation.
FedEx's revenue is mixed, lower forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported disappointing results of the last quarter, and the giant delivery service reduced the forecast of annual profit due to the decline in demand for freight transportation services and an increase in costs in its subdivision of ground transportation.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares declined by about 2.5 percent on preliminary trading 45 minutes before the opening of the stock exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year, which ends next May, which is 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts assumed $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The decline in the forecast is observed despite the rise of rates on average by 4.9 percent, which will come into force on January 4, and the growth of fees for ground transportation of heavy or large cargo, which begins in November.
The company said it still plans to increase revenues compared to last year due to cost reduction, increase in gross income and growth of online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "has worked steadily taking into account the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and global trade."
The plans of hiring labor during the holidays were announced the day after the statement of the competitor, UPS, that they plan to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $ 692 million, 6 percent more than a year earlier.
Income per share amounted to 2.42 dollars, close to the average forecast of $2.44 per share conducted by Zacks Investment Research by a survey of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5 %, to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks assumed 12.23 billion dollars.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in the urgent international transportation sector, which led to the lack of growth of gross income in its express transportation division.
However, the online shopping boom has dramatically improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue from ground transportation increased by 29 %, but operating revenues remained unchanged due to increased costs of large shipments and self-insurance.
The express transportation division received higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector the income fell due to higher labor costs.
On preliminary trading, FedEx shares dropped by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15 at the stock exchange.
They closed Tuesday, falling by 11 percent per year and 17 percent below the record of June 11.
At the most anticipated in a few years of the meeting, the leaders of the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table of honduras, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end, a richly decorated meeting room in two floors above them will hang a wall image of the United States.
This card is a reminder that the president of the Federal Reserve, Jenet L. Yellen and her colleagues, should put the country's economic interests above all others.
The Central Bank received a double order from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and keep stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is also a third, unwritten order: financial stability.
And this third order may be an unknown factor in an almost predicted decision, which will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by an almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show a confident economic growth, recent turmoil on the global financial markets can hold and so cautious leaders of the Federal System from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds - even by just a quarter of the percentage point.
"It is obvious that the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist of brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
Approximately half of the recently surveyed Bloomberg economists predicted an interest rate growth this week.
The financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to refrain from this, while the key indicator shows only about 30 percent of the likelihood of a rapid rise.
This can lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal System raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions do not soften the blow with the promise that the next increase will not be soon.
On Tuesday, Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,579.85.
The rise was provoked by the expectations that the individuals who define the strategy of the Federal System will leave the stake this week, - said John Longski, chief economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It will be a surprise if the Federal System raises rates at this point of time," he said.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve does so, "they will have to go far in the approval of their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands, so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that the rate hike could calm the financial markets as it would remove the uncertainty about how the Federal System would act.
Just a month ago, the Federal System seems to have inclined to raise the rate by 0.25 % this month, making the first small checker in slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen stated in spring and early summer that she expects a rate increase this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs in August slowed down, labor market growth was stable this year.
Unemployment declined to 5.1% last month, which is the lowest indicator in more than seven years, and almost at the level, which in the Federal System is considered full employment.
Wage growth shows signs of acceleration.
And although inflation continues to be below the annual average of 2% planned by the central bank, the leadership of the Federal System said that the key reason was the temporary effect of a sharp drop in oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates, and needs them, taking into account the reduction of the labor market," said Ian Sheferdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devaluated its currency.
The average Dow Jones index for industrial companies fell by as much as 16% of the relatively high-ranking value in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy could slow down global growth.
The market partially recovered its position this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% lower than the high May value.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve, the indignation of the market additionally complicates the difficult calculations of the term of interest rate increase.
"In the absence of information on what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would tighten the nuts at this meeting," said Stephen D. Olyner, senior researcher of UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former employee of the Federal Reserve.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will wait for at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
"There is a great uncertainty about what may be the consequences for the American economy, and they have almost no reliable data after the latest events in China," said Olyner.
The health of the world economy is not part of the main concerns of the Federal System, and technically it should not be taken into account when making these decisions.
But essentially the Federal Reserve has become the world financial power.
The impact of the Central Bank in recent years has been huge.
One only hint from then Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could "substitute" its monetary expansion, caused market turmoil around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertling with each other, it would be possible to expect the heads of the Federal Reserve not only to monitor the developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other Central Banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is "rather art than science," said Zakari Carabella, head of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global strategies for managing states.
Jeffrey Laker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve there were cases of excessive reaction to the financial market movements, which seem to be not related to economic principles."
The hacker, a member with the right to vote of an influential Federal Open Market Committee, insisting on raising the rate, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led to the fact that the Federal System reduced its base rate by 0.75% for three meetings, "despite the limited identified consequences for growth in the United States," - said Laker.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal System abolished these declines.
The federal reserve system should take care of stability only in times of big crises, such as the collapse of the market in 2008," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the interest rate establishment committee in Bank of England.
The last panic did not come close to this level, he said.
"Of course, you would not want to be in a situation where you are afraid of the growth of rates due to the fact that the markets are experiencing a shock," said Pozen, President of the Peterson Institute of World Economy.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and as long as this changes, I don't think they should be ahead of the events.

State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin admits that the United States deliberately destabilize the situation in the Middle East, so that the waves of refugees rush to Europe.
As Interfax reports, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulan Bator within the framework of the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question is asking itself: is not Europe the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East with such maniacal perseverance in recent years?" he asked.
"For sure, someone expected and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who escape from death will rush to the prosperous EU countries," he added.
Naryshkin asked: "Do many European political leaders openly spoke about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally swinging their countries?"
"No, the old Europe, with a rare exception, prefers to be silent," he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO is tramples many European values and norms of international law.
"Unfortunately, Europe has been looking for a long and impartial and looking at how the military shoe, sewn according to NATO standards, tramples and moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law are being tramred," the speaker stressed.
The governmental troops and loyal to them are opposed by rebels, consisting mainly of Islamists.
Later, the Islamic State, banned in Russia, joined the opponents of the Syrian government.
The U.S. supports the rebels who oppose both Assad and ISIS.
The official Damascus considers such rebels terrorists.
The Syrian President called the reason for the West's dislike for Russia.
The West's claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are actually that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, the First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put another person in his place, which will act in the interests of Western countries, and not in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to the sharp reversal of the Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power undemocraticly, despite being elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West."
Putin called on the world community to unite forces with Assad to fight against the "Islamic state."
Commenting on the constant statements of the West that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves - at the request of the people, not by the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Commembly.
"If the people want him to stay - the president remains, otherwise he should immediately leave," he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation is being carried out with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism together with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking of Iran's military support, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He denied the assertions that Iranian military units are being sent to Syria.
Tehran supplies us with military equipment.
"Naturally, there is a exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out," he explained.
As for the rest of the states, we are open to cooperation with any of them in the presence of a serious desire to fight terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called antiterrorist and anti-Igilov coalition led by the United States," Assad said.
The number of casualties exceeded 230,000 people, the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group "Islamic State," banned in Russia.
The international coalition headed by the United States strikes ISIS positions from the air.

It is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the State Department John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.

Boroday described the information of the American newspaper as slander on Strelkov.
Former chairman of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic Alexander Boroday denied the information that was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview to Lenty.ru correspondent.
The Washington Post's note is beautiful because everything is completely transomed.
Of course, no one connected and "goed out" from the territory of the Donbass republic in a very high mood, without ropes, without three wagons of money, which are attributed to him by different characters," he said.
According to Boroda, the talk about Strelkov in a conversation with the reporter of the American newspaper was really going on.
"Yes, I said that Strelkova urgently needed to remove from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," - said the former head of the government of the Donetsk People's Republic.
Boroday stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that Strelkov was taken to Russia "related."
I suspect it's a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, it is surprisingly misunderstood words, as I emphasized that Riflemen had left himself," said Boroday.
"It's slander both on me and on Strelkov," he concluded.
Earlier, the pages of The Washington Post published an article that quotes Boroda's words that he had taken Strelkov to Russia forcibly.
According to the publication, Boroday noted that he had to link his colleague.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
Polish foresters began cutting down trees over the underground tunnel, where, according to some data, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
The works began on Tuesday, September 15, according to Reuters.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to verify the reliability of rumors about railway composition with treasures.
Inside the train can be armament and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Nizhnesilez voody, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence of the gold train is no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to entangle the area of the search.
Three days before, Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland Peter Zhukhovskiy said that local treasure hunters with "probability of 99 percent" found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich, which is spoken in legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are found, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm appealed to the authorities of the Polish city of Valbzhi with a message that they found a train in a bricked tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The main narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons up to 21 years.
The main narcologist of Russia proposed to ban the sale of tobacco up to 21 years.
Eugene Brun noted that before this age "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - acts especially harmful."
So he said live on the radio station "Govorit Moscow," commenting on the information that the speaker of Sovfed Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years of age.
Man ripens unevenly.
You can serve in the army since 18 years, a person is physically ready for this.
Psychically he is ready for a full-fledged life in society since 21 years.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry finally ripens only by 21," said Brunstad.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project "Trezvaya Russia" Sultan Khamzaev told "Izvestia," that Matvienko supported the initiative to increase the age of the census in the sale of alcohol and "agreed together with the Public Chamber again raise this issue at the site of the upper house of parliament."
According to the activist, a working group will soon be created in the Federation Council to develop a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check compliance with the law on information protection of children
A resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor's office to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law "On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development," the correspondent Sib.fm got acquainted with the statement on September 16.
The author of the appeal said that on August 26, 2015 he purchased the Bible in the store "Chitay-gorod" on the Red Avenue, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his opinion, violate the Federal Law "On the protection of children from information that harms their health and development."
On September 16, the application was accepted for consideration by the prosecutor's office of the city of Novosibirsk.
The response to the appeal of a resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - commented the applicant correspondent Sib.fm.
In addition, this is a very thorough problem that will stir up the society.
It will begin to reread the Bible, which was not done before.
Brazilian Union of Pediatr Reu Grande promotes healthy nutrition for breastfeeding
Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS came up with a scandalous method, with the help of which it is going to convince women of the need for full nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves the demonstration of images of infants sucking breasts, painted with images of harmful food.
The breast milk includes various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, of which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy needs of pregnant women and born women, it is recommended to increase the daily rate of calories by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that one increase in calorie is not the only change in the diet that the mothers should do.
In a recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor of Bailor Medical College in Texas, it turned out that healthy nutrition of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents the development of tumors in them.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child's immune system has been identified.
Under Hamburg the train rammed a school bus.
Near Hamburg train crashed into the school bus, which is stuck on the railway.
23-year-old female driver, realizing that she can not move from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute after that, a collision occurred in front of them.
He was filmed by one of the students on the video.
Because of the emergency among students panic.
Some children began to cry and run along the side.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, miraculously no one was injured, except one passenger of the train, who received light injuries.
Damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors call for banning boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) urged to ban boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Junior.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries in a duel with Philippine Carlo Magali.
Fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, held on Friday, ended with the victory of Magali knockout in the 12th round.
Brown was hospitalized with a cranial injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to the life support apparatus.
In the professional ring Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one fight ended in a draw.
He had two children.
This is the second case of death among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Braidon Smith died from injuries in the ring.
Now AMA recommends not to engage in this sport, but better, from its point of view, to ban it altogether.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally, - said the vice-president of the organization Stephen Parnis.
But in the form in which there is a box, there will always be situations where an athlete gets hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads either to death or severe damage.
For this reason, the AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure uniting practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin urged the OSCE PA to abolish sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin described the introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians as unacceptable.
He said this, speaking at the session of the OSCE PA in Ulan Bator.
We regard this as inadmissible actions as an offensive to the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and errand of the principles of open international dialogue," the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the participants of the OSCE PA to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's return morality to politics.
Let us return the dialogue and the right to the practice of international communication.
Let us return the humanistic ideals to the democratic world order.
"Dvuness never ended with anything good," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma urged parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I urge members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific tasks in ensuring security.
"Firstly, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group," Naryshkin said.
He also noted that it is necessary to pay tribute to the OSCE.
"This is almost the only common platform, where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," - said the politician.
Recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulan Bator and will last until September 18.
He was delighted with a victory for a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for a 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergei SHUBENKOVA.
He managed at his crown race 110 meters with barriers to win at the European team championship, set several records, and most importantly - to become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, recently the athlete won the final stage of the " Diamond League," finishing in the overall standings third place.
Novye Izvestia asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the departing season.
Sergiy, the season is not over for you yet?
Yes, I'm going to speak at the World War Games, which will be held in October in Korea, and then I will think about rest.
However, I will prepare now at home, in Barnaul, and to be at home - it is still a completely different condition.
It is easier than every week to moot around the world.
You once said that autumn is a favorite time of the year for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September - a wonderful time.
Passion after the main start of the season boiled, the burden of responsibility is no longer crushing.
You can compete in pleasure, on the "sleasbon."
Plus you know that the holiday is very soon...
And there is fatigue?
Still, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions...
Fatigue by the end of the season is always accumulating.
And it doesn't matter what he did more - he won or lost.
Each competition is stressful.
Constant flights, crossings - all this does not pass for the body without a trace.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the rise.
Yes, there - I'm just happy!
By the time you finished at the World Cup in Beijing, come back often?
It happens.
And you, journalists, do not let me forget about it.
But in general, I believe that the bad athlete who lives with old victories, scrolls his successful races over and over again.
I was delighted with the victory for a couple of days - and it is necessary to move on.
Preparing for this wonderful season was very different from the usual?
I can't say there was something so special.
We started to prepare in December, but the winter competition season I missed.
Trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the camp, then at home again.
Everything is as usual.
But with the coach set the task: try to reach a new level, which I have not yet been.
Almost all winter time spent to lay the base.
They ran a bunch of crosses, did exercises on physical training, which included both the cravings, and the squats, and we pumped our back.
Then they started for barrier training, many engaged in equipment.
How are the opponents watching?
I always try to do it, there is no problem in the era of the Internet.
He looked at the European Winter Championship, and there in the barrier sprint the whole podium took the French!
I thought another: you need to do something, dilute this company.
With each start this season, you added and added in the results.
Did it give confidence?
I have all the last seasons formed according to about the same scheme.
There is no such thing that I run at first 13.20, and then - 13.50.
I always unwind my shape gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was to run out of 13 seconds.
The whole work was aimed primarily at this result.
But the paradox is that you seem to feel that you are ready for feats, and in competitions to show their readiness is not always possible.
How was it, for example, at the Olympics in London?
I, to be honest, that semi-final race (Shubenkov could not get to the final. - "NI") tried to forget immediately.
It was very good, really could run out of 13 seconds.
Even if he repeated his best result at the time, would be the bronze medalist of the Games.
But it was not lucky.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
And what about it?
In Tegu it was.
I really wanted to get into the finals, there was such a maximum program.
And fell off right from the treets, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that tearing and breaking my head - it means not to run anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the World Cup in Moscow has already reached the final with the best time.
I remember my feelings well before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the "gold" then!
How do you manage to develop decent speed, not to lose a head, not to disconnect?
But this is the most difficult.
You need to be very careful, focused on technology, so as not to fall barriers.
I noticed that when you are tuned not to the result, but to the process, it is much easier.
And the most bulge, when you have the feeling that you run and everything is as if it turns out!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the outskirts after the first serious successes seek to move closer to the capital.
There have never been such thoughts?
At home is still better.
And I can't imagine where I am without my coach, who do I need?
Maybe it would be good to have better conditions, but I try to be satisfied with what I have.
With Klevtsov you have long been together?
Since 12 years, since the as in athletics came.
More precisely, at first I trained at his wife, who worked with the children, and then she passed me.
I started with a sprint, then I jumped in length, triple.
Children's all-around was - it's when the ball is thrown, jumping in length from the place...
At 14 I tried running with barriers, and I liked it.
From the first race it was possible to comply with the standard of the second adult category.
So it remained.
Was there no fear of barriers ever?
Once immediately it turned out to agree with them.
But the equipment always had to work a lot.
Won over one over the dispersal how much he suffered!
But from this routine not to go anywhere.
The technicians have to be hoisted constantly - so that at night I could wake up, I immediately got up and ran through the barriers.
All who saw your race in Beijing claim to have been a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
Usually I do not review my races, and then I could not resist.
But efficiency should be further worked on - there is no limits to perfection.
Do not be afraid now that the victory a year before the Olympic Games will lie on the shoulders with a heavy load?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
Once he chose this road, it must go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you are not weak, no additional load should not be felt.
And I absolutely agree with him.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, not so much I am naive that I am amazed by the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, they are not food - give, throw the enemy.
And although I didn't get around with the flag, and the same, exactly the same, a million times here, and didn't call anyone directly, I was hurt by another one.
All my pseudo-friends in an inten, in a second they evaporated somewhere.
The press, which I am exposed to, is so strong that even I, who saw the types of boys, I think that the people of whites have embraced.
It seems to be going, going, and a crowd attacked you and well muted with rods.
But I have to know me, I'm not a room icing, I'll give me a push, I'll give it to the howitzers, old, guys, to be afraid.
Another thing - no support.
I still have no illusions, but now...
The best in me has always been self-sufficiency, so bite.
And to give passports to such freaks as Fred Durst or Monson, can only fools.
It would be better for me, the best journalist, to the work unsubstable.
A week ago in Kiev Otar Kushanashvili sharply described the Crimean events:
What was committed with the Crimean peninsula - a crime.
This is what is called an annexation.
I think that the reference to how Khrushchev, who had drunk, tried to sign something, never fits into the general picture of the human hostel.
This is how to come to the neighbor and pick up his living space...
The war from the Kremlin went, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, it began with the call of some bastard from the wall of the Kremlin.
I have the assumptions who it could be...
Kobzon is not so much to live left.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
He'll lose the apartment?
Well, they demolished the monument to him.
Of course, people remembered him as insulting his small homeland.
And now the reconciliation depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seventh is leading in the ranking despite attempts to highlight the loss of the Ninth leader in the Today Show
The racist of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra to cover the consequences of the Liberal Party's announcement of the release of the leader's seat could not raise the rating of Today.
The ninth morning show was broadcast from the capital of the state after the defeat of Malcolm Ternbullo Tony Abbott.
Competitor - Sunrise - with leading David Koch and Samantha Armitage, stuck in London as part of a weekly international broadcasting series, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara-Folls and Cancun.
This distance of torture did not seem to be much important for Australian TV viewers, while the Sunrise audience counted 397,000 spectators in the five largest cities compared to the audience of Today in 339,000.
Today scored a little more compared to its rating on Monday (315,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August Today had 318,000 compared to 330,000 at Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap fluctuated between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September Sunrise has 349,000 spectators against 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change have more influence than the Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are all right, thank you for clarifying!

An important news for the Seventh was the stunning debut of 800 Words with the former star of the series Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
A new drama about the newly widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with its two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics argued whether Thomson could cope with a popular show alone, without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibni.
The result of yesterday's evening is a loud answer "yes."

The three finalists are unanimous in the fact that the Holostyak Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is disclosed ...
Lana Jevon-Fellouz, Sarah McCay and Snezhana Marcoski may have accidentally made it clear who would win in the "Holostoka."
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually remain in the "Holunter" is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who reached the final, of course, keep silence about who of them got his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McCay, Snow Marcoski and Lana Jevons-Fellouz on the eve of the day when two of the three girls would have to stay, they may have given an uneasy hint about the winner.
Sam Wood persistently keeps silence until the final to be held on Thursday
All three women come to the lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, determination, family values, cheerfulness as the reasons why each of them would be happy to become his companion.
However, with their answers to the question "If not you, who should get the last rose of the Wow?" they could involuntarily tell, which of them actually won the heart of the "Holosty."
Jevons-Fellous and Marcoschi without doubt called McCaea the perfect pair for Watt.
A good relationship was established between Sarah and Sam from the first day.
"Since I entered the number of participants, I felt the energy (Sara) and the energy of Sam and realized that they were very suitable for each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt of it," said Jevons-Fellous.
"Sara is a very open person, it is easy and fun with her," Marcoski added.
I saw them together, there really is an attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McCay believes that she and Sam Wuda will be a great couple.
McCay herself said that thanks to her home dates last week she realized that Wood might be "the very man."
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it was not just a game - I believed him with all my heart," she says.
When asked who should choose the Vodou, if it is not she, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls in the same way, and Snezhana and Lana are worthy of this equally.
The The Bachelor show is released on Wednesdays at 19.30 on Ten channel.

Jarrid Hayne had several options to start a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in after his move to the United States - as well as many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian Rugby league player admitted on the first return of the panta in the winning game against "Minnesota" with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hane another opportunity to return the panth, and also involved him in the game after the injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula showed himself on the good side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of making a divorce for beginners in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Haina at a press conference after the match.
Special reporter of the 49ers club Cam Inman said that Hayne also received support from the coordinator of special teams Thomas McGia, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball on the return of the panta by the team of "Minnesota Waings" during the first quarter
At this beginning of the debut in the NHL Hayne and his numerous Australian fans clearly did not count.
It was seen how Hayne swearing, leaving the field after losing the ball, and later he told the leading show "Hams and Andy" at the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which could not imagine a more unsuccessful start for a career in the NFL.
"This happens, you just think about the next game and everything," said Hayne.
Hayne compared his miss to the debut in the series of games Origin in 2007, when the ball roll in his standings entered the attempt of Queensland.
In the end, this experience was very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne was photographed with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a picture on Instagram.

Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk with Russia's support of Bashar al-Assad's regime.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned that the support of Russia to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad aggravates the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks aggravating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal to combat extremism, if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power," the statement reads.
Kerry confirmed the U.S. commitment to combat the Islamic State (the activities of which is prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) as part of a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad "will never be able to be a reliable member of the coalition."
Also during a telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved by political transition from Assad.
The White House threatened Russia with isolation due to the support of the Assad regime.
On the eve of the White House spokesman Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation, if it does not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join an international coalition that conducts an anti-terrorist operation against the "Islamic state."
Recently, the media have often reported the presence of Russian troops in Syria.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and help Syrians learn equipment to use it against Islamists.
Four were killed when the police opened fire with rubber bullets on the protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in the south of Nepal, when the police began shooting with rubber bullets in the crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution of the country, as the official representative said on Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandei district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
Bisna Prasad Dakal, head of the district police, said that more than 1,000 protesters gathered at one of the police departments, some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dacal said that the police used tear gas, then fired into the air before launching rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is unclear why rubber bullets, which are known to be killed, but they are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, caused such high mortality.
This clash was the last few weeks of fierce protests in the southern, plain part of Nepal, where representatives of the Madesi people claim that the new provinces, formed under the new constitution, will reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in the West of Nepal, among the citizens of the nationality of the taru, who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting from 10
August, when four major political parties signed an agreement on the separation of the country into the province, which was the decisive step towards the new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which was centrally ruled for several centuries.
The work on the new constitution has been carried out since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake, which took the lives of thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted for the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said that the new chapter will be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Sayansk - the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as a center of chemical industry, has a developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by the new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
He told the correspondent of "Oblastnaya" about the results of the first year of his work, about new projects and prospects.
Oleg Valeryevich, where did you start working as a mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of inspections of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit examination of the expenditure of funds of the local budget.
Then a revision of municipal property was carried out.
One of the first practical steps was the reduction of document circulation to five days.
Previously, the papers could go by instance for months.
Measures were developed to increase the revenue base and optimize costs.
In November last year, a visiting meeting of the government was held in Sayansk, where issues of socio-economic development of the territory were discussed.
There were no design estimates in the city (PSD) for any object.
Without this, Sayansk could not take part in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of the PSD on the roads, kindergarten, northern sewer and water supply.
Now road works on two sections are already underway.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens in the city?
In July of this year, 105 children were born in Sayansk.
Such positive demography in the city has not been observed for the last 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in kindergartens today is one of the most topical.
Since September 1, the kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 seats, has been closed for major repairs.
The estimated cost of repair - 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, after the repair, kindergarten No. 23 was opened, which is now attended by 200 children.
The repair was made on the conditions of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost amounted to more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and assistance of the regional government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment were sought, and the program "People's initiatives" helped.
There are plans to start the construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the sequence of children aged one to three years.
We do not have queues for children from three to seven years old.
Investors are interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction of the city should be engaged, first of all, the sayan enterprises, it is they that need to be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphans in the Leningrad district is commissioned.
As for the construction, I will add that Sayansk - one of the four cities of the Phangarya, which entered the program for the construction of housing economy class.
All the necessary documentation has been prepared.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In total, we announced the construction of 10 thousand square meters of housing wishing to participate in the program a lot.
One of the conditions - housing should be no more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this cost includes finishing "turnkey."
If we cope with the specified amounts, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we also have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Sayan pig complex was built on the territory, which in 2004 was sold for a priceless price.
We work with the Prosecutor's Office to contest this transaction.
Especially since the land under the object - in the federal property.
Work with Moscow is underway, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to the regional property is being solved, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest in the reconstruction and launch of the project 1.5 billion rubles.
With the start of the pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great help for the city.
In Sayansk developed the institute of social partnership?
We have signed about 140 contracts of socio-economic partnership.
Many projects were implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Such enterprises as CJSC "Vostok-Center," Novo-Ziminskaya CHPP, "Sayansky broiler" LLC, "PK MDF" LLC, the management of these enterprises responds to all appeals.
Immediately for the City Day of LLC "Sayansky broiler" donated a children's town to the city, the company "Vostok-Center" carried out repairs of horse yard, where specialists deal with children andpaterapy, spending more than 1 million rubles for this.
Thanks to the sponsor's funds it was possible to improve the territory of the city registry office.
Sponsors helped to celebrate the City Day colorfully.
As in the good old times there was a parade with the participation of city collectives and organizations.
The chronicle of the city, the book of Saean poets was released.
First-builders and people who made a serious labor contribution to the development of Sayansk, were awarded jubilee medals.
The patrons also participate in the work of the city charity fund.
The first step was to acquire instruments for young talented musicians.
For nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles is aimed at supporting talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, support of children from low-income families.
How are personnel problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
The city lacks doctors and pedagogues.
To solve the personnel issue, it is of great importance to provide housing specialists.
Over the past year we allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers received service housing.
We have a program for the allocation of housing with the ability to privatize it in five years.
The plans are to redevelop the building, which will build eight more apartments for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the program "Housing for the Russian family."
In the future - the construction of a house for employees of the budget sphere.
The most important thing is that there is a working team in the city, with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to make the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
A bill on social pension indexation was introduced in the Duma, taking into account the rise in prices.
The State Duma introduced a bill providing for the indexation of social pensions annually from February 1, taking into account the rise in prices.
The author of the document - deputy from Just Russia Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsev - also proposes to carry out additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum exceeds the rate of growth of prices for goods and services.
Social pension indexation, according to the current legislation, is carried out annually from April 1, taking into account the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum of pensioner in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law, introduced to the lower house, provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions, taking into account the rate of growth of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexation is transferred to February 1, and the second is held on April 1.

Google launches a doubling donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced the beginning of a doubling of donations intended to collect $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help the population of European countries flee from war and depleted countries.
Google has used an uncharacteristic personal approach, announcing a campaign to collect donations on its blog.
Instead of making a statement made by one of the leaders, Google employee Rita Masud, who fled with her family from Kabul, when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We got on dubious trains and buses, suffered hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are desperately in need of help.
Donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations assisting refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Salvation Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double the first $5.5 million donations until the amount on the google.com/refugeerelief page will reach $11 million.
Europe is opposed to the strongest refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused for the most part by the four-year civil war in Syria, due to which more than 4 million people moved this year.
Many also flee from the wars of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with little obesity can help obesity surgery
The favorable effect after obesity surgery in people with little obesity with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still early to say that diabetics with little obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The statistics of mortality are not manifested at all at once," said Dr. Robin Blaxtoun, an expert in obesity surgery, who wrote about a new study in the column of the editor of JAMA Surgery.
Surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of organising food.
In a few years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the main studies were conducted among people with morbid obesity, having an index of body weight (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, the weight measure relative to growth, is considered normal at the value from 18.5 to 24.9.
BMI 25 or above indicates that a person is overweight, and people with BMI above 30 are considered obesity.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwanese hospital Min-Sheng General used data collected since 2007, to compare two types of bariatric surgery - bysic bypassing stomach and sleeve gasectomy, with medical treatment of diabetes 2 type in people with little obesity.
The average value of BMI in those who were surgically intervened fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, BMI in those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains at about 29.
Among those who suffered the operation, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and partly - 28%.
In the group that received drug treatment, for comparison, only 1% of diabetes treatment was observed, and only partial - only about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "in general were better in the surgical group," the authors say.
Researchers also monitored the levels of hemoglobin A1s in the blood, which reflect blood sugar levels in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better to hold below 7%, - the researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, about 8%.
But the best glycelic controls, reflected by the good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to the head of research D. Chi-Ceng Su and colleagues.
The research group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, in comparison with the group that erupted gastectomy, the shunting group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg), achieved a greater BMI reduction (7.4 versus 5.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1s (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was closer to the full diabetes remission (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of a surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there are evidences based on the results of a study of people with excess body weight in Sweden, that surgical treatment really leads to an increase in life expectancy, as reported by the College of Medicine in Phoenix, Arizona University.
According to Swedish research for obesity people who have removed bariatric intervention, the likelihood of dying for 15 years was about 29% lower than the group, which used more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blaxtoun noted that it encourages people with BMI below 35 interested in such a procedure.
"Here the report is very important, because it states that such surgery is safe in a group with low BMI, where there is no increased risk of mortality or restary diseases," she said.
Blaxtoun added that people and their doctors should begin to take the weight seriously as soon as the BMI enters the range between 27 to 30.
"I think we are waiting for too long to make people take it seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse.
In Mytishchi robbers removed from the house of fur coats and 9 million rubles.
In Mytishchi robbers attacked residents of a Moscow-based house and stole 9 million rubles from them and three women's fur coats.
This is reported by Interfax with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown people entered the house located on Gorky Street through the open front door, tied the 20-year-old son of the mistress of the house and, threatening with both knife, stole 9 million rubles and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, the damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case was opened under the article "Rabbit."
Fans from Europe risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists who in 2018 will come to see the World Cup.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to get the appropriate permission.
According to experts, this is a very alarming sign.
In anticipation of the world championship authorities will urgently have to invent how to settle all guests of the city.
The interlocutors of "Rosbalta" believe that because of the tournament the cost of renting rented apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship for rented housing will have to overpay.
The FIFA World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for the championship, each hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do it: hoteliers are so afraid of inspections that often do not even send documents to the requests of the Federal Antimonopoly Service in St. Petersburg.
As the head of the FAS Vadim Vladimirov, the department studied 138 hotels and now plans to start 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to antimonopoly.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived the citizens, placing a certain number of stars in advertising, said Vladimirov.
The problem is that now on account literally every number, no one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city, tourists can count on 30.5 thousand rooms.
According to Smolny, in St. Petersburg 17 five-star hotels, 51 four-star hotel, 100 - two- and three-star, 550 - one-star hotels.
According to the first deputy committee for tourism development Nina Gvichiia, at the moment the classification was held only 23 hotels - so many checks were held accredited companies in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny at an amazing coincidence of circumstances is unknown.
That is, the past classification can be more, but no one knows about it.
"The last six months of hotels did not seek to pass the classification," - recognized the director of the North-West branch of the Russian Union of Travel Industry Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to deal with other things.
Another reason - budgets, which were not laid the cost of checks, while the procedure can cost the hotel depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles or more.
But still in recent years, hotel managers have intensified and began to apply for classification, assured Shadskaya.
Otels need to have time until July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but will not yet have the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that depending on the starry will be developed a fixed fee for the hotel room at the time of the tournament.
The formulas on which the cost will be calculated will be published next year.
This is done in order to prevent the rise of prices by 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to have a conscience and not to allow an increase of two or three times, but hotels need to be given to earn.
"I think the growth will be up to 50%," said Gennady Lamshin, president of the Russian hotel association.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that the fixation of prices corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much this fits into the framework of the economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It is better than a sway rise," he said.
It is not clear what will be with popular cheap hostels.
State Duma deputies introduced a bill according to which hostels should be banned in residential buildings.
We very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not concern St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the point of view that hostels should be preserved," Nana Gvachiya said.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels in any case should be ready to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma still approves the bill, then in St. Petersburg will close about 80% of hostels, and at the moment there are 1.5 thousand rooms.
According to the president of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers of the North-West Leonid Garbar, in St. Petersburg there are not enough two- and three-star hotels, which are just in demand by football fans, but there is a bias towards hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is similar to the situation when "the 80-thousand stadium is sitting 75 thousand vips."
This can be corrected just at the expense of mini-hotels.
The expert considers their possible ban to be "idiotic": "It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but visitors for some reason can not."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, I agree that it is wrong.
But if as a hotel, which guests come to for a short time, why not?
Mini-suiters risk to miss the World Cup and because of their slowness.
A hundred small hotels just do not have time to pass the classification, and the pit is plowed for themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels of the city will order the work.
"The companies that can carry out this procedure are not so much, so they will refuse less paid orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those that are more expensive," said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of the inspections carried out at the moment are much higher than St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is also associated with constant reshuffles in the tourist block of the government, which does not contribute to the coordinated work.
According to experts, if the St. Petersburg hotels are not enough, that is likely to have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
According to the example of celebrating the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg in the city can mobilize river fleet, that is, guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will come ready on the vans, in which it will be possible to spend the night.
Gennady Lamshin says: "The main thing is not to set up so many hotels, so that they are empty later."
Also very popular during the football championship will be used rented housing.
Most likely, the city will create a reserve of rented apartments.
Rental rates will increase by 10-30%.
"From the obvious - the first to leave the housing near the stadium," - said the specialist for renting the Agency for Development and Real Estate Research Larisa Bragina.
And the rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
This will be facilitated by the construction of new traffic interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Do not forget about the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people not only tell the road, but can also conduct a mini-tour.
There are complications.
My dad in 1970 in the yard met a family from Murmansk - father, mother and two children.
They had nowhere to spend the night: it was difficult with the hotels then, it was difficult to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," the interlocutor remembered.
However, he added that now there is no such feature in the inhabitants of the city - to call home is fraught with consequences and scary.
But maybe, in 2018, after the unsuccessful decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "mereled" the Amur region.
With admiration today looked at the clown of Zhirinovsky in the Duma.
He did such things when our generation was just learning to trade newspapers, and is still in a beautiful form.
The topic of the speech seems to be "the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) is a protest against the results of the Amur region elections.
The LDPR seems to have no shaking protocols - for there are nothing other protocols except those signed by the election commissions.
Here he raises Ivan Abramov, who took second place, and shouts something like: "Here is the winner of the election!"
And immediately nothing is thrown to Rodnina, and then, after the scribbling with the chairman, he moves the faction from the meeting room, screaming literally "You are all with the fronts of your swindlers and thieves."
Naturally, the press focuses not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
Really Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly sleaked the Amur region together with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another trick of Zhirinovsky in the style of "Subsands!," and not protest of the political party against the results of concrete elections.
And the faction formally Scandaled, and the elections, according to the party's website and Faisboutov, are not recognized, but the leader is obviously getting off the topic.
He provides the dead on the Amur to bury his dead, and he himself favors United Russia as a whole and innocent Rodnina.
A graceful decision, so that both the face does not lose, and not the real, and not the ostentatious scandal to go.
Another thing is that Abramov himself is now in a strange position.
In addition to the cry of the bosses, he did not wait for anything, there are no alternative protocols on his hands.
He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other - for a narrow circle it became a formal occasion for insulting the respected champion, and that even cooler, the Kham attacks against ER and the ONF.
And then, of course, he should seriously think what to do.
Because of the main beneficiary of elections, the number 2 of the region's policy and candidate number 1 for the only regional single-mandate district, he can turn into a party, which was successfully used by its own party leadership and super-irritant for that same UNF and the party leadership of someone else.
That's right - there wouldn't be Zhirinovsky, he should have been invented and respectfully watched.
Trump before it is still growing and growing.
It was news that the LDPR would return to the hall during the next plenary session.
That is, the bath fell at all with nothing.
Only, Abramov's theme was buried under her.
Beautifully really.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for the end of violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama touched upon the continuing crisis of refugees in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama's compassion center in Oxford on ethical research at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that in the current circumstances the interests of humanity should be higher than the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that although this arouses admiration, the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate to the situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama spoke highly about the actions undertaken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"The care for thousands of refugees is excellent, but at the same time you should think about long-term decisions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries," he said.
After all, we should think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George W. Bush after the 9/11 terrorist acts, saying that the harsh reaction of the United States launched a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11 I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is possible through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed a disinfectant for hands in the last 4 years
Toxicological centers in the United States reported an almost 400 percent increase since 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age who have swallowed a high-d Alcohol hand disinfectant, as reported by the toxicological center of Georgia.
According to Dr. Gailord Lopez, director of the toxicological center of Georgia, the cases of child swallowing up to 12 years of hand disinfection liquids, which were reported to toxicological centers, increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children are in contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately, some percentage of them are sent to the ambulance department," Lopez CNN said.
He said that some children drink a disinfectant liquid specifically, and some do it to impress their friends, or to argue for social networks.
The videos on Youtube show how teenagers drink disinfectant liquid as a cheap drink.
As reported, teenagers mixed disinfectant with alcohol-containing mouth rinse liquid to get a stronger drink.
Children of younger age can attract pleasant smells of disinfectant liquid.
"The child doesn't think it can harm him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (dreinfecting liquids for hands) are those that are aromatized.
There are disinfecting hand liquids with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive to children.
Disinfecting hand liquid contains somewhere from 45 to 95 percent of alcohol.
In small children, in particular, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This is a high concentration alcohol," - said Fox 4 in Kansas City Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief doctor of the toxicological center in the hospital of the University of Kansas.
You wouldn't have left just a glass of whiskey, but people keep in mind these disinfectants for the hands, and if children get to them, this is a quick way to use a large amount of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a disinfectant hand with strawberry flavor in the amount of about four sprays, was sent for treatment to the ambulance department.
The level of alcohol in her blood was 179, twice as much as an adult, who is legally considered intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchi, an ambulance doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett medical center near Atlanta.
Naija confused the words and could not walk when she was taken to the ambulance department.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic, so as not to miss any signs of brain injury, because of alcohol the girl fell and hit her head, Rytchi said.
"It was very scary," said CNN Ortoria Scott, Naigi's mother.
This might well have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use non-professive substances or disinfecting napkins, in addition, to remove disinfectant liquids for hands from the area of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfecting fluids are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after they swallowed a disinfectant containing an toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol - a deadly agent, not ethyl alcohol, which was indicated as an active ingredient.
In January, three four-grader students in the north of New York agreed to poison their "against" teacher by "proliferation of antibacterial substances in the class," according to the police report.
The teacher has a strong allergy to disinfectors for hands, and she forbade them to keep them in her class.
The police believe that the failed plan was "empty conversations," and addresses the discipline of the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children's library named after N.K. Krupskaya sads cast iron owl.
The babies who come to the books are trying to feed her with candy.
For several generations, this library has been going to this library for 95 years.
The first readers in the twenties of the last century arranged loud readings here, staged performances on the poems of Mayakovsky, held literary quizzes and rewritten with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalinets" wrote in 1939, every day "friendship between Hope Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of the children's library of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda even sent her children's photography to her friends to the distant Barnaul friends.
And when the Barnaul people asked whether Nadezhda objected to the library to assign her name, she wrote that she was not, does not object.
The guns have been burning in the museum for a long time, and the grandchildren and grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose harsh profile is decorated with bas-relief on the library building.
During the years of perestroika, different people often called, were resented: why is the children's library not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of some good children's writer, without political coloring!
The librarians sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as they were.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, as "leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby - a path of yellow brick.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is the favorite theme of the artist Oli Moskovka.
Previously, Olya was a manager in a law firm, came to work at eight, left five, and from all other managers differed only in love for drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet: "The illustrator for the book is required."
The culbirk was written by a little American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mother's cancer."
Olya made illustrations, and thought: life can end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it if you don't create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books of writers around the world and composes fairy tales herself.
It is traditionally believed that children are losing interest in the book that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But reading children go to us, and their parents understand the importance of reading, - says the "Russian Planet" director of the library Tatyana Kusvid.
In recent years, we even have such a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and it will live - the children are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition stained-thing with a renewed photo exposition.
Once a quarter, new photos of readers are posted, who go to the library with the whole family: mom, dad and children.
The library is happy that Popes are increasingly coming with children.
If at two years the child was read only Chukovsky, then at the older age he needs books more complicated.
But now there is a law under which eight-year-old vunderkind is prohibited to issue books from category 12+.
To get such a book, the child must bring with him parents - they come, then return again, and gradually "Croep" becomes for them something like a family club.
The library has treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of epics with yats and urami, to lead Korolenko in the appendix to the journal "Niva," embroidery "Murzilki" in 1936.
After all, we are not only the conceptual space of the "chram of the book," we are now open to the movement, we try to become a special place: not home, not work, not school, - explains Tatiana Kusvid.
You can come to us to read together, play, paint.
We have made a play area for kids - the child comes just to play, and the hand still stretches to the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by parents, and they rest on the feet, do not want to leave.
Often moms come with wheelchairs - and we are pleased that the library they put in the first place among all other places where it is necessary to come with the kids.
Tatiana Kusvid says: modern children just like we once love classical children's literature:
"The publication is now developing, and a lot of attention is paid to the authors who are the link between generations."
And if we talk about small children, it is important for them to be some hero who travels from one book to another.
Children do not like to part with their heroes.
The library constantly publishes booklets for parents, which tells what is happening in modern children's literature, what books should pay attention to and why.
Booklets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is forbidden for adults to take books outside the reading room.
This magical privilege is only available to children.
...In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement, in a bookstore.
The steps will be screaming under your steps - this is a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood you meet as an old comrade: hello, it is good that we do not change with you.
Ellie still walks cheerfully along the road, pashed with yellow bricks, the lazy Tol Ryzhikov steals magical matches, and the Malchish-Kibalchish did not say to the cursed bourgeois of the Military Mystery - he has a firm word.
Books such as passwords, on them anywhere you can learn their own.
There are real book rarities in the repository - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of episn with yats and cherami.
Or the story of Korolenko in the famous appendix to the journal "Niva."
Or the embroidery "Murzilki" in 1936.
Time has aged the pages, colored them in a tea color.
These publications are no longer issued to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I dream of everything - I will retire and I will go to rare children's books.
But children will not be led to this, so to speak: colors in the old books are not very bright, and themes... you open the first page, and there - Lenin, a party, a Komsomol.
Now it seems: why did we all write this "Pioneer truth?"
But it was still interesting, - says Galina Ilyasova, head of the bookstore.
The "Murzilki"'s "brewn't" from time to time.
Galina leads a book depository all her life.
She knows what color Buratino's hood, in which academic year Harry Potter became the captain of the Gryffindor team at the Kiddiquid championship, in which situations Carlson uses a silencer for the motorman, and who is the father of Alice Selezneva.
The librarian is paid little for the work, and everyone who can live without these book ranks find another profession very quickly.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, teachers, ministers of the cult of the book.
They can be found also by a smile - it is believed that this is a professional feature of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of conversation - it is a professional.
I generally love children's books: as a librarian I like them to be, to stand smoothly and beautifully on the shelves, and I also love reading them, - says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical story, fairy tales, science fiction.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that was happening to me at that time.
And since I loved them madly, it seemed to me that the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone is sitting and reading.
I hope that the books will always be, despite the readers.
And I rejoice when our former readers bring children, or even grandchildren...
The rumors: There is no disagreement in the "Celtic"
Griffiths denied the talks about the disagreements in the "Celtic" after Daly's recognition that "Hupes" is in a bad situation, but he will correct it.
Harts will protest against the Scotland Football Association's claims against Neilson, and Warberton fears the signing of contracts in January, which may violate the team's unity
"Dons" increased the advantage over "Celtic" to five points
The penalties of Adam Rooney in the first half gave "Aberdeen" a slight advantage over "Hamilton" in Pittodri, which allowed "Dons" to break away from "Celtic" by five points.
Griffiths denied talks about disagreements
This caused rumors about the disagreements in the "Celtic," which were suppressed by Griffiths, who said that he and his teammates do not suffer from any intensified criticism, preparing to meet with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the tension, I believe that the players aspire to it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in the fight for the title - de Bur
Former midfielder from "Rangers" and former member of the Netherlands Ronald de Bur said that Dutch football fans lost interest in "Seltiku," because he does not compete for the title with "Rangers."
De Bur, currently - the representative of "Ajax," said: "In Holland no longer show the most attractive moments of the games "Celtic," and why?"
This is because there is no Rangers.
People here speak not only of the return of the Rangers.
They talk about the "Old Company."
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they are interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the "Old Company" games, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'm changing everything," Daela said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that "Celtic" is experiencing difficulties, but the Norwegian coach has sededed to change everything.
After the defeat from "Malma" and, as a result, the exit from the Champions League soon followed the loss of 10 players "Aberdin," who now, tearing five points, occupies the top position.
But Dale said, "The Selytka had bad periods before, and we'll come out again."
Now we want to get out of it as soon as possible.
I understand that this is very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very evil or upset by what is happening.
And we too, but we must continue.
And we really need the support of "Celtic," because the players are getting much better from it.
Staying together now is so important.
Warberton with distrust waiting for January transfers
Despite the opinions that appeared just a couple of weeks ago, suggesting that he identified some of the goals of the January transfers, the Ranger boss, Mark Warberton, distrusts the January campaign, claiming that he does not want to destroy the unity of the team.
Former striker of "Brentford" said: "January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season to adapt them, what you have seen in our own group this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more harm is caused by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Michu, who is interested in "Celtic," hinted at the completion of his career
The forward of "Suonsi" Michu, associated with "Celtic" during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his contract with "Swans."
29-year-old player suffered from ankle problems for two years and could not leave Wales this summer.
Harts are going to confront the SFA on Neilson's statements
"Harts" led with a score of 2:1, when they removed Paterson, and began to lose 3:2, but the red card of the defender later canceled; this is the third red card Collum, canceled in eight months.
Neilson does not give up his words, saying, "I have not questioned ethics, I did not comment on the game."
Griffiths slurry to avoid Mynkasl
The stubborn player of the team "Haibernian" received a reprimand after he admitted that he sang a song with insulting words about former player "Harts" Rudi Skazel.
The incident occurred in the pub in the Roseburn district of Edinburgh in Edinburgh before the start of the derby on the Secrets in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was hot," the striker said, adding, "I can confidently say that I wasn't going to go back to the Secrets, if he didn't play for the "Celtic."
Donnelly: Tannadis's advice is confident in the management of "Dandy United"
Simon Donnelly claims that the board of directors of Dandi United is still confident that the team of managers will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the guys to get out again," Donnelly said.
Mcinnes is happy to have won against Hamilton
Derek McInness admitted that his team "Aberdin" had to fight desperately against "Hasilton Assis" to achieve the seventh consecutive victory in the league championship, which put them five points higher than the "Celtic," at the top of the standings, thanks to the penalty Adam Rooney in the first half.
McInness said, "There is no team that would win something - a cup, or a league championship, who did not win the meeting in this way."
The unemployment rate among Scots does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing
BEZRABITICS in Scotland remained at 164,000 people in the period from May to July, while the number of non-working in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was above the level of the United Kingdom of 5.5%, as the figures of the National Statistics Service (ONS) showed.
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people in three months, with the number of employees now is 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell by a quarter to 74.0% - it is higher than the average of 73.5% in the United Kingdom.
David Mandull, Minister of Scotland, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The government's long-term plan laid the foundation for economic strengthening."
It was almost a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we saw a further improvement in the situation in the Scotland labor market with employment growth and a decrease in unemployment.
Why I am a witness of the execution in Oklahoma
Today, avoiding legal intervention at a late stage, I will see how a person is executed.
If this happens and I hope that still not, I will sit on the observation gallery of the suicide camera in Oklahoma prison, when Richard Glossip will be executed with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
For the first time this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As I approached this day, I began to be afraid.
So why do it?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell the detailed story of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique angle.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend the executions in America, and since those who want more often than places, the results of the gloomy lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, he will look at it without emotions.
I can't do it.
I will sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we have had our own relationship with him after a few months of phone calls and one visit, which lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I will have to try to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me of Twitter that I acted with my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could formulate better," but still believes that I am wrong with what I am doing.
Richard Glosip did not agree with anything of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't have done it, even if he were speaking.
I told him he could cross me out of his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants the journalist of the international edition to be present there to write about it.
If he dies, he thinks that publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this matter, listen to the podcasts that I recorded.
I will not go into details here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions after the assassination of Barry van Treesee make him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe that there is a high probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I am firmly convinced that the evidence for the death sentence was not enough.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this angle I will see how he dies.
I cannot say that I will be completely objective.
There will be other reporters, to whom you can contact.
From me you will learn what it is like to watch as the person I like dies without necessity.
A person persecuted by police persuaded to get out of the Canning River
Constable from the town of Cunning-Wail managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River, and stay dry.
Perta's inhabitant intended to leave the police, but failed, stuck in dirty water in shallow water a few meters from a police officer trying to "sitly persuade him to go ashore."
The Cunning-Weyle Police was called on Tuesday on the fact of illegal entry into someone else's territory in Bakkingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get away from them, rushing to Cunning.
But he did not swim away.
"He stood in the water and said, "I won't go out, let's get me," said Sergeant Shandell Castaldain.
Constable Laclena Perchatura did not really want to wet the shape, so he used a safer reception - "negotiations with a good policeman."
"Somesterly do strange things to try to escape," says Sergeant Castaldain.
Football champion Ben Casins was remembered by this.
In 2006, Kazins went to the cuvette to avoid meeting a police patrol to check alcohol, and tried to swim over Sough.
His efforts were in vain, but encouraged the locals to invent a joke "Ben Casins' biathlon."
Peter Moody accuses stewards of espionage and threatens to leave equestrian sport
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria stewards of attempting to introduce a spy in his stable last year and threatened to immediately leave the equestrian sport.
His target was the stewards and staff of the ethic department of Racing Victoria, whom he accused of organizing a campaign against him personally, and removing from the start of Lady Tatai due to the violation of the rules of medicines on the day of the start, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always makes every effort by participating in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of Lidari's cobalt sample, which he cannot explain.
He held the language about the suspicions of espionage for a year and a half and did not want it to "look like grape greens."
"I was not going to talk about it, and I have been patient for a long time, but sometimes it knocks you out of the track so much that you are no longer restrained," said Moody.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Today I will go home and sleep hard.
I want to walk with a high head and I want my owners to know - I do everything possible for them.
When they start thinking that's not true, then I will need to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think what to do with my license.
Earlier Moody sensationally said during an interview on racing.com that the department of ethics tried to spy in his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat down in a room with a man I would call if asked and offered him a job in my stable to convey information about what I was doing in the stable," said Moody at Racing.com.
They clearly believe that I am a fraudulent.
If so, they should all of them certainly have to make statements, as the attempt to catch me has failed.
Robert Rollston, former chairman of RVL, David Moody, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, the executive director of RVL, knew about it all the time and know it now.
Shouldn't it make me think that it's becoming personal?
Shouldn't RVL gain courage and call for account for what is happening in this business, other people, besides coaches?
Are I the Bad for this profession?
Is I so bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it's so.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt what I'm saying now, can make them think about it.
But I have come to the point where I don't care, and it's sad to me.
It's really sad for me.
I will exert pressure on them and impose responsibility on them for making a decision.
I have family support and I can leave.
The coach's sediment was only growing during a long investigation of the case with cobalt and Lidari, and the last removal of the horse from the start made him say that he can "slee his license to the table."
Moody, most famous for having prepared the invincible champion Black Keyard, called the requirements for the use of medicines on the day of the competition "laughing" after the legs of the horse was applied compress from clay, which is a violation of the rules.
This is a violation of the rules at the races.
"I must bear full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly made her a compress on her leg.
She could get a compress last night.
She could get it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody can be disqualified for three months according to the rules on the use of medicines on the day of the competition for the use of a compress, on which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's an anecdote.
People who create these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it went too far," said Moody.
The driver who committed the raid and hid from the scene in Kobrama was arrested
The police arrested a man who knocked down a motorcyclist on the weekend in Kobrama and escaped from the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to the hospital Royal Melbourne with serious injuries after he was knocked down by a car on Murray Valley Highey on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
It is assumed that he will be charged with leaving the scene, not providing assistance and violation of other traffic rules.
Motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Kobrama, remains in a hospital in a stable state.
Coach "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellami parried the accusations of rivals in the use of tough power techniques
Coach "Melbourne Storm" Craig Bellami called the criticism of the ball interception by his team as "impositioning the agenda" from the two favorites of the NRL championship.
The coach of "Sydney Rousters" Trent Robinson said that the judges allowed the "Storm" to "fight" with his team during the sudden victory of "Storm" in the final qualifying game in Sydney on Friday evening.
The coach of Brisbein Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made a clear hint at Storm after his team won the final of the qualifying tournament at Nozern Queensland Countyboys on Saturday night, when he called this game "typical" for the rugby league and said that two of Queensland's team were "too successful" in the hand.
Bellami defended the interception of the ball with his team and said that they were just focused on the "contact," intercepting the ball.
Bellami added that he was instilled in the critique of his team from the two leading coaches, as it means that they are concerned about a possible defeat from Storm.
"It continues to pop up - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talk about hardachments when they beat us with a score of 24:2," said Bellami on Wednesday.
I can entrust that we have not changed anything for a whole year in our systems or protection techniques, just in the last six weeks we have paid special attention to the contacts when intercepting the ball, and it has become a turning point for us.
The train has been there for three years and he has been clearly training an excellent team, so he probably didn't get used to losing, and for him it was a shock.
s' s' kind of as it always manifests itself at this time of the year.
Bellami argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football," reminding his teacher that "Sent-George-Illavarra Dragons" Bennett won the championship in 2010, showing "boring" football.
Wayne speaks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our Friday night, and see how impressive their game was," Bellami said.
I remember that in 2010, St. Johnge criticized a lot, calling a boring team, and Wayne said that he did not care at all.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers impressive football, especially his young midfielders at their speed.
It's football that you would like to play when you have such players.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two such midfielders as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things as they are somewhat concerned about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably did not think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellami also noted that the game "Storm" and "Rusters" was a competition with more points than the game "Broncos" and "Caubois."
The game "Broncos" probably was good, I have not seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game it was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is it impressive football?
Or to consider the breaks and unsuccessful attempts to be impressive?
For me, it's a routine.
If they mention us, it means that at some stage we can meet with them there.
At the end of this week's "Storm" weekend, as they won the right to take either the "Nort Queensland Kaubous," or "Cronal Sharks" next Saturday night at the preliminary final at the AMI Park stadium, tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
You are here Home Serb charged with drug retention released on bail of 200,000 dollars
A man who faces life imprisonment for an attempt to assign 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland by smuggling was released on bail of 200,000 dollars.
Marko Maksimovic, 29 years old, is one of five people arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht, who came from South America through Vanuatu and moored in Kumer in August.
Throughout the morning Maksimovich and his accomplices were seen on the pier, and later he met them in the cafe Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maksimovich faces a life-long term for attempting to assign drugs sufficient for sale, lawyer Maksimovich claims that there is no evidence that the latter tried to get the whole party, and that a man could be in a cafe without any intention.
The judge of the Supreme Court Peter Flanagan doubted that Maksimovich had to be released on bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about the place of his location.
The Mother and stepfather Maksimovich were asked to make a joint deposit of $200,000 for his release.
"From the testimony of both it becomes obvious that the amount of the pledge of $200,000 is too big for them financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But one of this measure is not enough as a guarantee that it will not disappear, the judge added.
Maksimovic was allowed to be released on bail, provided that he will hand over his Australian and Serbian passport, he will be marked daily in the police and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 am.

It was a big game, - quotes AFP Katsikaris.

I talked to the coach Dimitris Itoudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, - quotes "R-Sport" Freeland. - In fact, I will be assigned the functions of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in protective constructions and in the attack from the three-second zone, and I think I can cope with it.
Yes, I will need some time to restructure the position of the center, yet in the NBA I played more forward.
Now it will be necessary to face the big center rival, but I have already done this before, so I think, and now I will cope.
The Army won the Euroleague last time in 2008.
Since then, they have reached the "Final Four" six times, but there each time they could not show their best basketball.
There is an opinion that someone glazed the team.
In this game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it is difficult, I understand all the frustration of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best that we are capable of, we have a good chance to win the Euroleague, I really think so.
Always wanted to win this title, Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the thing, I am not a veritable man and I do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you connect these two things, everything is possible.
I also have no certain rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.

"Benfica" is above the class, but in the home match, I think, we can count on taking away their points.

But first you need to think about Galatasaray, and then about Atlético.
In home matches we can take points from anyone.

With blue and pomegranate it is difficult to play, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright individuals.

Messi is almost always successful when it goes into the way, so we need to keep compact and organized.

Stivan Hogg used the girl's phone to make pedophiles send photos
Pedofil used the phone 11-year-old girl to beg for images of violence against children.
Stivan Hougg took the girl's phone while she slept, registered in the Internet service of the message, where he received a number of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She checked him and found shocking photos, and then immediately drew attention to her mother's attention.
The police arrived and saw five images, after which she researched the computers found at this address, and found "corresponding" queries in the search engine using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done it because it could "attract pedophiles," and then he would " pretend that he was a policeman to scare them."
The authorized judiciary, Eilid Robertson, told the Sheriff's court in Dundee: "He said it was a predilence, he was addicted to frighten people.
He admitted that he had made requests on the computer, but said that it was because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman to scare pedophiles.
He was interviewed about the conversation with an unknown person who sent him images, and that he asked to send more photos.
He said he did this to lure them.
He said that he had problems with his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added, "When the girl found photos on the phone, she called her mother, trembling and wept.
She saw obscene images on the phone, and then with the accused was held a full-time bet.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the defendant used the computer and "Pleste" to talk to the girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23 years old, from Ward Road to Dundee, pleaded guilty of charges of making obscene photos of children on June 14 last year, violating the terms of bail on January 25 this year and not appearing in court for hearing on March 24 of this year.
The defendant's lawyer Gregor Sim has appealed not to add Hogg to the list of persons who committed sexual crimes, since it is possible to prove that there was no "significant sexual element" in this crime.
Sheriff Aleister Carmaicle postponed the sentence until October, until receiving certificates from social services.
Hogg was released on bail on this case, but he was taken into custody before hearings on other remaining matters.
He was included in the list of persons who committed sexual crimes before the date of the sentence.
President Robert Mugabe Zimbabwe reads the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, the oldest state leader of Africa, earlier this year fell from the stairs leading from the podium.
He was not injured, but the video with the fall scene immediately spread over social networks.
The opening of the Parliament was also overshadowed by the statements of the parliamentary opposition that they had received anonymous threats warning them from the whistling of Mugabe during the utterance of the appeal.
A month ago, they whistled the president during his address to the nation in the parliament; it was this speech that Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Member of the Parliament of the Movement for Democratic Change Innosent Gonaise said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with a warning not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The report came from the number that is not displayed, but it is entitled "death," he told journalists after the speech of Mugabe.
The MPs noted it warned that inviolability is coming to an end in the Parliament building and as soon as they come out, parliamentary immunity does not work.
Member of the Parliament said that the party headed by Morgan Tswangirai is "disaid" by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring program and reduce costs in the provision of services.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two companies registered on the stock exchange, separating the production of computers and printers from faster developing hardware and service sectors.
The deductions as a result of the estimated reduction of jobs will amount to about $2.7 billion, starting from the fourth quarter, according to the statement of Hewlett-Packard.
"Such restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Mag Whitman, Chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packtard, who will lead the organization after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more concentrated than Hewlett-Packard now, and the portfolio of business areas will be wider and deeper, which will help the company's transition to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $ 50 billion and "will focus on providing previously unattainable complex technological solutions" to companies, the company said.
This is how the company, formed in the 1930s by graduates of Stanford University Bill Hulett and Dave Pacard for the production of electrical equipment, shared their garage in Palo Alto called "the place of birth of the Silicon Valley."
Hewlett Packard is in the process of large-scale reorganization in order to move from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
This is HP's move, the world's second personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. technical companies, the latest event in the sector, based on the confidence that highly specialized companies are working better.
Captain "Arsenal" Michel Arteta says that his teammates should support injured Jack Wilshire before playing with "Dynamo Zagreb"
In a conversation with Wilshire Wenger also stressed that only September, and that if the restoration of Wilshire would go according to plan, he will not prevent him from returning to Christmas.
With the most favorable developments, Wilshire will definitely miss at least four next games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer is questionable.
The most offended in this recent problem is that Wilshire confidently finished the previous season with a single ankle injury and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during the pre-season preparation.
Hungarian: "This injury does not threaten his career."
It's just not to the end the harnessed bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
This is not due to ankles or injuries that he had before.
This can be related things from a medical point of view, but as well as Hungarian, there is a associated risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has recorded 23 different injuries that happened to him in six years since his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 of the 157 games of Arsenal in the league for the last five seasons.
If you look at the layout for the Arsenal wider, you can notice that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, "Arsenal" was one of the two Premier League clubs, on account of which the most missed due to injuries days.
Hungarian recognizes the likelihood of stuck in the vicious circle, but in Arsenal believe that the improvement of the statistics on injuries in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, returning to the ranks after an injury, you are vulnerable for some time - during this time you need to recover strength and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough and will cope.
I hope he will be physically restored, I am sure of this, as well as that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal begins the campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday against Dinamo Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and the next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the composition.
Ector Linenrin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so most likely in the starting lineup will be played by Mother Debyushi and Arteta.
Perhaps Wenger will also join Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Giroux instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little respite to those players who need it," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional favorite in Group F, the stadium "Maximir" in Zagreb is one of the most depressing in Europe.
"Dynamo" has not lost any of 41 matches since they managed to spend last season as "Invincible."
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was exposed to an earthquake of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal learned the lesson received last season, when the team was defeated in the Champions League game from Monaco, and remains with a weak hope to lead the club to win the final of the Champions Cup.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger said.
The Arsenal has never done so before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy show that taught us serious lessons of men's friendship
The absence of such stories is evident, especially given the desperate need of men to frankness, now more than ever, despite the fact that the level of suicide among young men is at maximum in 15 years.
In 2013, this was the only biggest cause of the death of men between 20 and 45 years in the United Kingdom, and with men happens three times more often than with women.
In an attempt to understand the problem of "Campaia against Unhappy Life" declared 2015 the Year of men in order to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression has revealed that if a patient has quite a large number of friends "in normal mood," the chances of curing are doubled.
Equally for those who are not in depression, the circle of mentally healthy friends doubles the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, that friendship work, first of all, it is necessary to be.
In an era when communication is managed by social networks, when style prefer content, the quickness of the answer is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, loving fun and successful, even if solitude reigns in reality.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner aspiration for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger effect on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire recently noted, the creator of video games, for money in general, you will not buy more happiness.
The Drinity of Friends is that they attract attention.
Each of the characters was determined not through his work, but rather through the person who appeared in communicating with friends.
Joey's humor and the constant embrace of Chendler, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, the swell of Ross on Rachel - everything proceeds from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from studying their feelings.
As the Samaritance employee told me: ..." my role as a listener for people who feel depression and suicidal moods, emphasizes how even the smallest communication of friends can benefit."
Often those men who turn to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old teaching "live with it" is strong, just like the feeling that a frank conversation about problems can be perceived as a weakness."
Friends is one of the show that comes to mind when I try to offer more prolonged working mechanisms to overcome.
It emphasized the unsealed moments of men's friendship.
As for my task, the status of an outsider talking on the phone, helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from the close circle of family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the holiday has completely restored the scenery, why not take your friends to drink at Central Perk.
Or even better - if Starbucks you see a lonely person, smile and say "Hello."
In more time not to guess what benefits friendship can bring.
Friends series show on Comedy Central from beginning to end, all 236 series, on tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal, helping "PSG" to defeat "Malma"
Angel di Maria along with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani celebrates scored goals in the goal of "Malma."
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal than allowed "PSG" easily bypassing "Malma" on Tuesday.
Here is the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job when Paris Saint-Germain started his game in the Champions League with a very convenient victory of 2:0 against Malmah at the Park de Princes Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after his first game in the Champions League as PSG to set the direction to the champions of France, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increased their advantage when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with "Real Madrid" and Donetsk "Shakhtar" in Group A, "Paris" had to take a good start in the game against the champions of Sweden, because they aimed not at qualifying the playoffs, but the continuation of a series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Laurent Blank to count Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later replace him on the pitch in the game against the team from his home city and club, in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or visiting the Champions League, so win with a score of 2: 0, deliver problems to rivals and play well in defense - this is a good start, even if there are still moments that we will need to finish during the season," - said Blanc.
This is promising.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I regret that we did not score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the substitutes in the Paris team, which brought her a draw with a score of 2: 2 in the match against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was pushed to the background of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker was marked as a player capable of bringing PSG to a new level in Europe after he was bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he ran to pass from Marco Verratti behind the defense of Malma and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johan Villand to the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone expected a light and great victory from the PSG, they had to be disappointed.
"Malm," which won the playoffs Celtic to get to this stage, having nine world-class players on the pitch at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two support midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of the strike of Nikola Djurdzic, in which the ball flew past the far bar of Kevin Trapp in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
But PSG at times summed up itself with ineffectual transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half could not realize at least five attempts, and then could not handle the ball scored by Kavani immediately after the resumption of the game.
However, he showed himself much more skillful in the precise passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, who, Di Maria sent the ball with a twisted blow, which went to the barbell past Viland in 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after a hour mark thanks to Kavani, Uruguayan scored his sixth goal in the season after Ibrahimovic corrected the ball sent to the center of the field from the left flank of Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malma had to return to the game, and only the interception of the ball by Viland at close range did not allow David Luis to increase the final score before the replacement of Esequiesel Lavessi did not count the goal at the end of the match.
The coach of "Malme" Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was a class above his team, while the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League was held in December last year."
Since then, we have played only in the Swedish league, and this is not the level.
Qualsifications are not enough.
Glory to Paris!
It was a wonderful match with them.

During the meeting with Governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev talked about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in modern difficult conditions.
The question of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be touched upon - they are necessary to reduce the cost of machines for the end consumer.
Problems in the work of Tyumen trading house "Belshina" and options for preventing losses were discussed.
Issues important, as investment projects should work clearly and bring profit to the region.
It was said about further deliveries of passenger and cargo equipment of JSC "MAZ," development of the service center of JSC "MAZ," which was created in Tyumen on the basis of "TTPTP."
The conversation also touched on the preparation of the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus until the end of this year.
Another topic of the conversation was the completion of the agreement and the signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation of the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relationships promises to reach a new level.
These questions were also related to the regional center.
During the meeting with the head of the administration of Tyumen, Alexander Moor, we talked about the renewal of the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already "breathing on the franchise," because a new batch of cars from Belarus, which will work on gas, environmentally friendly fuel.
Another aspect: Tyumen lift plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products of Mogilevliftmash OJSC, receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the programs for the installation of new elevators in the regional center.
I would like to add that within the framework of the extended powers of the consul, a meeting was held with Governor of the Kurgan region Alexey Kokorin, during which he discussed the issue of increasing trade turnover and supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zaural.
A meeting with the Governor of the city is scheduled for the end of September.
The extended consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of headquarters of the district.
The region is a polygon for rolling out many promising projects, including the work of the honorary general consul.
In general, such meetings are significant and good because they allow to directly and quickly solve many problems, taking their acuteness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current conditions, it is extremely important not to destroy the situation, continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon is against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people engaged in film production
Matt Damon argued with the African producer Effie Brown, stating behind the scenes that there is no need to take into account the ethnic composition.
During the Sunday release of Project Greenlight on HBO, the famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative points of view on the main black heroine in the scenario chosen for the project.
"Multi-Essence is appropriate when you are casting for the movie itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
The scared Brown, not conferably exclaimed "Ogo! Nothing to myself. Well" all the time, while the actor from Martian gave comments live.
To discuss the finalists of the show, the show was joined by the producer Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers.
"I would like the participants - no matter who will be the director - to think about what interpretation of the image of Harmona they are going to stick to," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is the prostitute beats a white pimp.
The producer of the film Dear White People spoke for the directors of the film to be Leo Angelos and Christen Branaccio; Damon was sharply opposed, saying that "in the end we can get not what we want."
After the discussion was shown on television, social networks exploded with disapproving comments to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni spoke furiously about the video: "Explanation of the essence of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room TAKOBE BELEG, which is already painful."
Twitter scored more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "likes."
Daimon's statements appear just when the competent coverage of the racial theme in the media is the most acute question on the agenda of public discussion.
After 2014, a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by a policeman, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colored population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of the applicants in the nomination "Album of the Year" at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"Algods still matter," he said.
As books and the lives of blacks, albums still matter.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released an official statement in response to the Fox News employee Elisabeth Hasselb about whether this group will be considered as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the leaders of the movement said.
Recently it was announced that Damon was included in the list of figures of show business, producers and media magnates invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" rewards the first champion
Professional climber and assistant waiter Isaac Caldiero on Monday evening became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior," taking home a prize of 1 million dollars.
At this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants managed to pass all the stages of the track with obstacles.
In the final season, two participants - Caldiero and cameraman Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a 75-foot rope climbing in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first and settled at the given time, becoming the first athlete in the history of "American Ninja Warrior," which passed the dim stage 4, but Caldiero coped with the task for a whole three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
After the victory with incredible work, Caldiero, who was shocked by winning a million dollars, gave an interview to "E!News."
"It's unbelievable to think about it, I've never earned and lived more than $10,000 a year," commented Isaac to journalists E! such a serious leap in his income.
And all of a sudden it's... I've never imagined how it happens... the future is unknown.
Executive Producer Kent Wid met with the journalists of The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the final and why Britten, who was the first to pass the track, will receive no cash prize.
According to the rules, the money gets the fastest participant.
"If the finishers are more than one, the prize gets the fastest of them," - said Wid.
Although money is a wonderful reward and change life, it still gets a great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels offended about this.
He is happy with what he has done.
He received tons of enthusiastic reviews from fans.
He is a wonderful man and a family man.
He is a hero for his children and wife.
Jeff told me, "if I was destined to lose someone, I'm glad it's Eisek."
And I think Aisek would feel the same if we had changed roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will begin to shoot in the spring of 2016.

Kadyrov's original complaint according to the book "Polba to God" was submitted to the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsky court.
The Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Court received the original appeal of Ramzan Kadyrov, representative of the Chechen president, to the decision to recognize as "extremist material" the book "Pleas for God: its meaning and place in Islam," Interfax reports referring to the chairman of the city court Alexander Chukhrea.
Now the court is waiting for possible objections of the participants of the trial.
Chukhrai refused to comment on statements by some Duma deputies on the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign special services and ISIS.
"Pool yourself comment on such stupidities," he said.
On September 11, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognize the book as "extremist material."
The Prosecutor's Office of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk received an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to recognize only the author of this book as extremist, rather than the verses from the Qur'an.
According to the Prosecutor's Office, the judge made a wrong decision," Chukhrai said.
The decision to recognize the book as "extremist material" was made on August 12, 2015.
In particular, "extremist" were called quotations from the Qur'an - "You worship and pray to You for help," "Don't cry to anyone along with Allah."
Kadyrov called those who made the decision on the book "shaitans and provocateurs."
He called on Duma deputies to legally ban judicial decisions relating to the texts of sacred scriptures.
"I firmly believe that the State Duma should adopt a law according to which it is forbidden to make decisions directly concerning the texts of the Qur'an and other Divine Scriptures directly," Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will delete comments insulting migrants and refugees
Employees of the "Fabsbook" intend to remove posts and comments, which give a negative assessment to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints of users on illegal content.
The management of the Facebook intends to fight against manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network together with the Ministry of Justice of Germany.
Thus, on the eve of the head of department Haiko Maas said that currently the Ministry together with specialists of the social network is engaged in the creation of a special group of moderators.
Its participants are required to monitor and remove incorrect comments against migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for the removal of their recording.
To promote the operational blocking of illegal content should also be organizations whose specialists are engaged in collecting complaints from users of the social network on offensive posts.
The management of Facebook intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements against migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was made after xenophobic sentiments rose sharply in the German segment of the Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis, which covered the EU countries some time ago.
For example, in Germany, all the points intended for accommodation of refugees have already been crowded.
On the eve of the country's authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks, which contained prisoners and prisoners of war in Nazi regime.
On Moscow cemeteries will appear areas for relaxation.
In the near future, several capital cemeteries will equip specialized areas for relaxation and psychological recreation.
Among the first will be Butovskoye, Domodedovo, and the cemetery of the It.
The first zone for psychological recreation has already appeared at the Troekurovskoy cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, such areas will appear in other parts of the city.
This portal m24.ru told Artem Yekimov, who holds the position of the head of the State Budgetary Institution "Ritual."
Relaxation areas will be of small landscaped areas resembling parks.
According to experts, in such "corners" cemeteries visitors will be able to relax, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, the relaxation areas will be built in Domodedovo, Butovo and Scherbin cemeteries, and then in other districts of the capital.
According to the head of the State Institution "Ritual," in the event of the need to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forests to the maximum possible volume.
Green plantings will serve as a living fence, which will separate the recreation areas and area, allocated directly to the burial place.
Experts of the State Institution "Ritual" also announced their intention to make a proposal to abandon the hedge at burials.
New cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, the State Institution "Ritual" told about the readiness to install electronic terminals, with which visitors of cemeteries will be able to learn GPS-coordinates and number plates of burial.
In June this year, the State Institution "Ritual" also proposed to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of the year.
So, digging graves in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the land is frozen.
Note that for the last year the prices for all types of ritual services rose by an average of 10 percent.
Five days later, they found a lost mushroom in the forests of the elly forests.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest more than a hundred hours without provisions.
Discovering the mountain-mugnik was possible thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
Without food and water.
He was searched by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even cynologists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was able to find after the helicopter connected to the search work.
That day Vitaly Alexandrovich went to the forest for the opes and podberezoviki, but did not return by evening.
Relatives immediately asked for help, and the next day in search of a mushroom rescuers and concerned residents from the neighboring village - only about 30 people.
On the fifth day they joined the helicopter of the fire and rescue center.
Andrey Seletkov, the head of the search and rescue team of the fire and rescue center of the Smolensk region, said: "Helicopter attracted, the man was discovered."
He left very far, completely elsewhere.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He passed a great distance at his age.
The miracle remained alive.
Mushrooms were taken to the central district hospital unconscious, in an extremely severe condition.
Doctors diagnosed his pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and overcooling of the body.
As an elderly man could stay alive after five days spent in the forest, doctors do not represent at all.

The emergency An-2 sat on the ROW in the brotherly taiga.
Directly on the ROW sat in Siberia emergency An-2.

On the liner abandoned engines and on-board electronics, but the crew made the impossible.
On board the aircraft were 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was injured during an emergency landing.
Become an Economy - Nobel laureate: globalization
Globalization processes should have been to help reduce inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in incomes of the population in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
In order to improve this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers, says Erik Maskin, Chief Researcher of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Selection of Decisions of the National Research University of Higher School of Economics, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2007.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between the countries became more and more open.
Globalization supporters predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these forecasts have come true in many respects," Maskin emphasizes.
For example, China and India have received a serious GDP growth per capita.
However, not everything is so rainbow.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the "incoming" and the "non-income" in poor countries, which is manifested in the great income inequality, or, more precisely, wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, says Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies," published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by NIE HSE.
Together with economist, Professor of Harvard University Michael Cremer Eric Maskin developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the difference in income in poor countries increases as globalization grows, reminds NSE HSE.
In the new global market there are specific processes.
To demonstrate them, Maskin allocates four levels of qualification of specialists - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries lack the level of qualifications to cooperate with experts A and B from rich countries.
And if the employees of the level C from poor countries are growing due to cooperation with employees B of the rich, then employees of D do not feel or their salaries are falling at all.
The final effect is that the internationalization of production will increase the gap in wages between the two categories of specialists in poor countries and thus increase the level of inequality.
Cremer and E. Maskin offered an amazingly beautiful model, alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It allows you to explain why globalization has led to income inequality, - says Fuad Alesgerov, Ordinary Professor, Head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Solution Selection, Head of the Department of Mathematics of the National Research University of Higher School of Economics.
And as any powerful theory, I am sure, it will lead to a surge of empirical works in this field.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the employees themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the means for this, and it is unprofitable for companies to pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, says Maskin.
The scientist notes that the developed theory in no way calls for the stopping of the process of globalization, which brought and bears fruit in the form of GDP growth of countries.
Derbent: a living connection of time.
Derbent - one of the oldest cities in Russia - celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
The program of festive events includes a festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of past times, an exhibition of Derbent carpets and the Day of open temples, historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed museum of Peter the Great.
Medieval stones of the fortress Naryn-Kala, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all as if it came off the pages of "Thousands and One Nights."
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been preserved since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantine, Khazar's ganat and the Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern boards, which grows in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Moss, is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Tree - monuments of living nature."
The shadow of spreading crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The visitors of the mosque will be filled with aromatic tea and treats Dagestani treats - honey figs, permum, muscula, cakes, chudu, ayran and sweets.
In Derbent for centuries use large samovars to drink tea of numerous guests at one time.
The inscription over the entrance to Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 year of hijra.
That is, in 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
This is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking with the scale and solemnity: the arcades of domes and vaults are based on square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
The content and breeding of pigeons is the traditional fascination of the inhabitants of Derbent.
Owners of domestic birds put dovehouses in the yards, under trees, in attics.
A spectacular sight - take off into the sky flocks of white pigeons, similar to the flashes of the festive fireworks.
For the purpose of defense from the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
Departing 500 meters in the sea, this structure locked the harbour of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the most well-preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification.
The carpets in Derbent wept in the V century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has survived almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market sold carpets for every taste - palas made of wool, cotton or felt of all colors and shades, with a thief and without it, with a complex ornament and a fancy rim.
Construction of the city began with mamagals - blocks with one-storey stone buildings.
In many years, the magicians have not changed much.
Only satellite dish antennas, air conditioners on the walls and street lights remind that you are not in the medieval, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, the details of the water supply system, built by Persians about a thousand years ago, have been preserved.
To this day have reached ancient sources in which the locals are gaining water.
Many derbents prefer the usual tap water from proven historical fountains.
In Derbent was one of the centers of pottery.
Possive and painted vases, dishes, jugs, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
Hands of potters and now make wonderful ceramic products both practical and souvenir purposes.
On the days of holidays and festivals crowds gather under a tightened rope, which is performed by students of the Republican School of Circus Art.
The history of amazing and risky skill has several centuries.
A new trend - among the cable-shods are increasingly possible to see girls.
The Museum "Culture and the life of Ancient Derbent" is currently operating in the premises of the former Maiden Bath.
Previously, unmarried girls and brides were washed, accompanied by friends, and now anyone can see the vaulted-dome hall, hot and cold pools that have gone into the past of bathing.
In most homes Derbent there is hot water, but baths and steam today are popular as in the past.
The use of heating the body with ferry is written in ancient books.
After the bath, blood is improved, muscles lose fatigue, the body gains flexibility and lightness.
The festival "Sodruzhestvo," which takes place on the territory of the fortress Naryn-Kala, is attended by ethno-thrafts of many districts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, sing songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and enjoy visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
Kyrkhlyar - the burial place of forty martyrs who formed their heads for Islam.
This is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims of the North Caucasus.
The sarcophagi that yellowed from time to time are carved from solid stone blocks and are oriented, as is customary among the Arabs, on the west-east axis.
The brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubova cut and save customers in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
Hairdresser in this place has been for many years.
The letters of barb craft are transmitted from generation to generation.
At the same time, the brothers of Yakbova can make not only a traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old City preserved a house in which the exiled in the Caucasus writer-dekabrist Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinskiy lived.
Having studied the Turkic language and gathered ethnographic material, he described Derbent of the first third of the XIX century with its ancient monuments, life and life of citizens.
Chayhana is a traditional Oriental club, where only tea and homemade pastries are served.
Men come here to quench thirst, talk with friends and solve some work problems.
As in previous times, women are not recommended to cross the threshold of teahouses.
Derbent Dance Ensemble "Caspiy" was created three years ago, but already managed to take part in the events of the republican and Russian level.
Soloists of the ensemble rehearsed every day, learning perfectly the people's Avar, Dargin, Tat, Armenian dances.
With the onset of the evening, when the noise and ignite street lights, the locals sit on the benches near the houses with protruding terraces.
As a rule, the derbents are discussing domestic issues.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they increasingly recall episodes of the unique history of their city, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
In Domodedovo there was a business "game at the airport."
In the capital, they experience a new form of education.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport staff.
To do this, Domodedovo installed models of three aircraft.
Young people not only examined and registered passengers, but also served aircraft.
All this - in the form of a business game, but in complexity it is not inferior to reality.
The late flights, at once two passengers with fractures on board, the gangway was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For the real airport - hell.
For the one that settled in the hangar Domodedov - a standard set of tasks that will be solved by beginners.
In one hangar fit three large airports from around the world.
Today there are four hundred students from the capital's colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn all about the domestic world of air harbors.
Registration of passengers, maintenance of aircraft, baggage turnover - they were entrusted with even buses on the airfield, ramps and inspection of passengers.
And passengers - completely problematic.
One turbone with documents, the other was late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious objects.
And to deal with all this, as in life - in the minimum time.
For each of these tasks they are accrued a certain amount, virtual money, as if they were the airline paid the appropriate amounts for the flight service.
"A fine is imposed on them for failure to perform the relevant tasks," explains Dmitry Hilko, financial analyst of the game, in an interview with Vesti-Moscow.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely watching the events.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of training.
She has already found a place in the course of secondary vocational education.
"There will be formed six interregional competence centers, which will become, in fact, new models of activities of modern colleges with modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment," says Natalia Zolotareva, Director of the Department of State Policy in the field of personnel training and additional professional education of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia.
But students - not to global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need a weekend.
But the assessments for this exam had quite a material expression.
The latest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding to the claim to our airport in Instagram in a timely manner," - satisfied the participant of the game, PR manager of the Frankfurt Airport team Sergey Shuvalov.
The best judges, what is called, took on a pencil to invite to his work by the time of completion of their studies.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret over the closure of the American Center for Foreign Literature in the Library of Foreign Literature.
The Center has been working in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American center of the U.S. Embassy at the Russian State Library named after M.I.Ruhomino in Moscow.
"One-sided steps taken by Russia in recent years question the Russian government's commitment to relations between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted even during the Cold War and in other difficult moments of the long history of relations between our countries," said the US Ambassador John Tefft, who entered the Interfax.
The American Center created deep and strong ties between people and culture of Russia and the United States.
He was a center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American prominent figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Only last year the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50 thousand Russian visitors," the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the program of educational exchanges FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was quick to rebull.
Typical situation: four officials stand in front of the table of Judge Svatanter Kumar, listening to his claims to the work done.
The court is completely unsatisfied with the quality of your work.
We did not give you a 110-page order to make you laugh at it," says Kumar.
If at least another brick is put, we will order to demolish all the existing buildings.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NT) - the judicial authority, established in 2010 in order to stop the rapid pollution of the environment, accompanying the rapid economic growth of the last decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has reviewed more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological developments, toxic waste and the construction of dams.
In two of three cases, the court decides to terminate the construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: for incomplete 60 years, which have passed since the declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development, India has evolved from a country of virgin jungles into one of the most over-the-inhabited and polluted countries in the world.
Particularly acute problem stands in large megacities, where the development of infrastructure does not have time for rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and wastes of enterprises and households, and few remaining residential areas are cut down for the construction of new residential quarters.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the state, the NCT is regularly criticized by the government of Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main reason for the abolition of the largest investment projects.
Thus, in May this year, the Minister of Environment described the court's decisions as "extreme" and "unfull."
Sometimes the court's decisions are really impossible to fulfill the deadline set by the court, confirms the lawyer for environmental cases Raj Panjvani.
However, the impossible deadlines have a positive side: at least, they make the responsible persons move.
"His main goal is to shake this system," the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly canceled large construction sites: on its account, the termination of the construction of the airport, power plants and hundreds of smaller facilities.
At the same time, people are also trying not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of the pharmaceutical company in Telagna, polluting the local river fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," Kumar commented on his decision.
However, such explanations do not always find understanding among ordinary people, whose life can change due to one painting of the judge's pen.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years of entry to the capital, which caused public indignation.
Despite the sharply fallen popularity and the flurry of criticism, Svatanter Kumar refused to cancel this decision.
Instead, he ordered from Delhi government statistics on entering and leaving vehicles, and also made a proposal to purchase 10,000 additional buses, before learning at the factories whether they were able to fulfill such an order.
As the attention of the court began to fall into the sphere of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even road incidents, people's anger began to subside.
But the most painful topic of the principal judge was the program to clean the Ganges River, with the pomp announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges - the sacred to the Hindus river, the judge often ceases to restrain his emotions and goes to cry.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water from the Gange on the statue of God, and there were feces in it, the judge is hot.
You continue to pollute the river because you think: Ganges is Ganges, he will take all our sins.
It is the river we worship and see what you do to it every day.
The cleaning of the Ganges is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm more than 120 times.
Every year from 1.5 to 3 of 700 million bathing in it Hindus die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Ganges Rescue Foundation, which he received from the sale of his costume, in which he met with Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
The economists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the costume was bought for $700,000, while at least eight billion rubles are required to clean the river.
The supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India has yet to go a long way before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that the cost of progress should be ecology.
"In a developing country, talk about the environment is often perceived as inadmissible luxury," says Malika Bhanot, an activist of the Ganga organization.
And the court tries to find a golden mean between ecology and development."

Xi Jinping Calls for Economy to Make Economy More Open to Peace
The economy should become more open to the whole world to boost its growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in addressing the group, which faces the task of reform management.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing a policy of openness," he said, addressing the participants of the 16th meeting of the Central Lead Group Committee on comprehensive deepening of reforms.
According to him, the expansion of openness and deepening of reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and will provide a new space for economic development.
The leading group adopted a number of directives, including the introduction of regulation of investor access to the market, changing the rules of border control, encouraging public companies (SOEs), attracting private capital and reviewing the system of registration of residents.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of economy and production inaccessible for investment will be compiled.
The system will gradually detown through trial programs.
This is an important step, as it will provide the market with a more significant role in the distribution of resources, ensuring the legality in the business sphere and increasing openness, as the statement reads.
The government will also weaken control over the powers granted to them to companies, thus ensuring that the companies themselves will conduct their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to master new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to strengthen local growth.
Even more areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of the sectors controlled by the state.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign funding, as well as provide them with better conditions," the statement reads.
Additionally, the procedure of filing applications for permanent residence permits for foreigners, or "Grin card," will be simplified by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the process of filing.
The meeting also discussed the provision of the rights of lawyers and the issues of training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report released after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yushan and Zhang Gaoli.
