Republican strategy to resist Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by combating voter fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, arguing that cases of voter fraud in the United States are more rare than deaths from lightning strikes.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade.
One thing is for sure: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, U.S. states are responsible for organizing U.S. federal elections.
That's why most state governments have passed laws since 2009 that make it harder to register or vote.
The phenomenon gained a new dimension after the November 2010 election, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills limiting the right to vote in 41 states were passed.
New election laws require a voter to show a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, eliminate the right to register a voter on the day of the vote and take away the right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to show photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
Republican authorities were quick to extend the practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to show photo ID cards in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike in quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of American citizens, or 21 million people who have reached the voting age required, do not have a photo ID issued by their state government.
In addition, five million new voters did not have such a document in 2012.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 percent of African-Americans, 15 percent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 percent of over-65s and 20 percent of 18- to 29-year-old voters don't have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Voter students who are believed to be voting for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use their school's photo ID in several states.
But these same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mostly for Republicans, to use the voting certificates issued by these clubs.
Until 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.
This is the first time such a requirement has been introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are apparently aimed at limiting the voting of Hispanics.
Two-thirds of Hispanic voters are believed to be voting in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers introduced laws in 2011 that abolish voter registration on polling day in eight states.
They have also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This restriction has not passed without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to list some 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the level of new voter registration in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the early voting period.
Thus, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of early voters were African-American, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the state's total voters.
The same thing happened with Hispanics.
Representing only 11 per cent of the electorate, they made up 24 per cent of the citizens who voted early.
Unlike whites, who, with 76 percent of voters, only 46 percent of early voters.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters are actively opposed to legislation restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws have been drafted by Democratic governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended under the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This has partially limited the negative effects.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have enacted laws requiring photo ID.
However, the new rules that came into force will certainly make it difficult to exercise suffrage in the 2012 elections.
Critics of Democrats denounce the bias of the laws that were enacted, seeing them as an obvious focus on influencing the outcome of the 2012 election in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that the states that passed the laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
There is only one certainty that these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: take a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes produces erroneous results, falsely and sometimes false positives, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, already reluctant to undergo dispensary, have something to doubt even more.
Take the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the United States have seen numerous cases of infection among the study groups, so the data are difficult to interpret and it is difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different mortality rates in those patients who were screened and those who did not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that those who did not get a metestosis were 30-40% more likely to experience metastasis in those who did not.
Therefore, I would recommend taking the test from the age of 50, or from 40, if one of the straight relatives had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and sluggish.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a danger to life in the long term, and making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we will start treatment.
Increasingly, we are pinpointing the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So I would recommend taking the test after all.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not to take this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the for and against the PSA test.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people had a healthy diet and moved enough, 30% of cases of cancer could have been prevented.
"If no one else smoked, that figure would have risen to at least 50%," said Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
Smoking control remains a priority for the Canadian Cancer Association, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous damage to people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in the city," said spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
Encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
weight
According to the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the association adds.
nutrition
The association also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
In too many quantities, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can harm the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the Association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been researching the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer.
But at the moment the results of these studies are not unambiguous.
According to the SCC, vitamin E studies produce conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In the assessment of the effect on the development of vitamin D cancer also is not completely clear.
However, Mr. Beaulieu stresses that it is important to discuss your anxieties and family history with a doctor.
"Passing the analysis does not lead to cancer."
Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, the news that scientists may have discovered the Higgs boson caused a real stir - and with good reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, neither much nor little.
It is also the last particle that was predicted under the Standard Model - our best, or at least the "least imperfect" description of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which had not previously been detected by experience.
But physicists are not yet fully sure that it is about the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we are dealing with a truly new particle and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, although some data are still lacking to be fully certain.
Let's imagine that we are talking about the Higgs boson, as the chances of making a mistake seem minimal, and we'll see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law completely inevitable, which reads that two things cannot end up in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to circumvent this rule, not even try too hard, otherwise harm yourself.
But while particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of this nature: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
On this basis, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find decent citizens called fermions who are prudently subservient to the Pauli principle.
In another bustling bosons, a vile gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least for this principle, which means they can quietly end up in the same place at the same time.
According to the website (by the way, quite extraordinary) Particle Adventure Laboratory Berkeley, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: mesons, which we will not talk about here, and "particles of force" through which the main forces of nature are spread and to which in some way refers to the Higgs boson.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal boson: photon, or "particle of light" which is the "courier" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a single particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "violates" the electromagnetic field in that particular location, roughly like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbance" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons of "power carriers".
A more stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference being that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be "broken."
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you need to reach very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could shake only a very large stone.
That's why you need a huge particle accelerator like the one used in CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! To achieve such huge energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, while others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never be held on the fridge.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like a photon, by the way) do not have it.
So what "can all this research bring," asks Ms. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to test the correctness of the Standard Model (CM), and it also allows physicists to find a discrepancy between observational results and CM predictions.
In addition, some of them are eager to see such a discrepancy revealed, because the slightest discrepancy can open the door to "new physics" and plug some holes of the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant flaws, offering no explanation for gravity (oh!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oy-oy!).
But so far, cern has not found such discrepancies.
consequences
The benefits of these studies for the everyday life of the average person are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it does not exist.
Look: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell's labs could not even imagine what a revolution their work would cause.
They foresaw their applications in science, but nothing more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which itself developed the first continuous laser (previous were pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was initially considered more like a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
And in addition, the application can be found for the toolkit accompanying the study.
For example, the same William Boyle during his optical research in 1969 developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although not its original purpose, now serves as an "eye" for all the digital cameras of the world and has earned the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die... | "Debt"
The Commission for a Dignified Death recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
Debate is about to resume, and a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
"Debt" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. Still lived alone in his apartment in Monterezi.
The prostate cancer that destroyed him from the inside gave him a two-year reprieve.
"I was given five years, I lived seven years," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the shelter of the palliative care shelter Victor-Ghadbua in Belyoy, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't prepare for that," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet on your own and even eating on your own.
Sitting at the table, which is a delicious lunch, he gives up and agrees to be helped to take food.
He is awake, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, lead him to the bath.
Courage before a common death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhoea, it's humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the ailment.
"During our lives, we are taught that a man should urinate standing up," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadboa shelter.
Regressing to a child's condition is an unbearable humiliation for some.
"It all depends on a person's ability" to accept decline," he says.
Because, according to many people engaged in palliative care, important events happen in the midst of this decline.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbua palliative care home are all with cancer.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses no longer provides care called "medical."
Ms A., 89, is most afraid of dying "in the mind of suffocation."
But the disease allowed me to get to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life," she says, before allowing her to wear a mask that makes her breath-relieved.
She is still waiting for the next visit of her son, who came from Italy, in the coming days.
At the shelter, Victor Gadbua, with the help of a group of volunteers, provides body care and nutrition assistance.
This is palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
For every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care facilities.
That's not enough, considering that sooner or later we're all going to die.
Here life goes on in the best conditions that are possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel - one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it's physical, emotional or soulful comfort.
We'll agree to give the dying man a brandy or Pepsi rinse, whatever he asks for.
We no longer force diabetics to control sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
In the morning, his son finished this beer in the legs of the deceased.
"We help loved ones as well as patients," says Natalie Savar, Director of Nursing.
In the shelter Victor-Gadbua not a single day is similar to the previous one.
Next to the 93-year-old, who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, sitting on his pillows during the toast in his honor, tragically dies a young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children and tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbua shelter come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients entering the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as victor-Gadbois shelter and the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is this large gap in the health care system that has led many palliative care physicians to fear the passage of a law legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Beginning in October, a manifesto signed by palliative care luminaries Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant has been circulating, indicating their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, the health care system in quebec is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to relieve them.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day try to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for Helen Richard's survival were already minimal when she stopped gruelling chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me she regretted stopping the fight," she said.
At the same time she told me that my days are numbered!
There is no omnis almighty care
Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask for death are thanked by the medical staff for not fulfilling their request, after the palliative care team relieves their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Society of Palliative Care, patients are not susceptible to pain relief in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time, or constantly.
We can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
Increasingly, patients who fail to relieve pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Pain patients always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be euthanized," it means "I want to feel better."
This report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Institute for Health Research Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in quebec
Officials responsible for road construction, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and specialists in the Italian mafia tell us day after day what they know about the colossal "system" that confuses the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and the mafia.
The "industry" that has cost the taxpayers of quebec very dearly, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is curious how this system collapses after all the means were put into action," jokes Jacques Duchene, deputy and former police chief of Montreal."
It was thanks to him that scandal erupted in 2011 as a by-product of the investigation of official crimes related to road-building contracts in quebec, to which the Prime Minister of the time from the Liberals, Jean Chare, agreed very reluctantly.
The Duchene Report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"Since the investigation began in 2010," he said, the Department of Transportation alone would have kept a billion dollars in contracts" if some had held back their instincts to take a share.
The Charbonneau Commission has "already ousted two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will be able to "dissect the schemes behind the individual personalities."
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Case was joined in 2011 by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, which included an extensive staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the special unit "Molot" which after 2009 forced the "sly cartel" of Montreal, to stop overestimating the value of contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out in recent weeks, and some municipal officials, notably Franck Sampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
Next up is Gilles Wayancourt, who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in the province.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes when placing government orders.
In addition, several Montreal Communication Service engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were formally charged.
The latter detonated a real bomb, telling the investigation about the "system" of obtaining government contracts.
For several years, he gave 3 per cent of the value of the contracts awarded in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who, in turn, transferred money to mayor Gerald Tremblay's united Montreal party.
In the 2000s, he was moneyed right and left. He transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mostly liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted illegally raising funds for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Natalie Normando.
Sewer contracts that inflated the cost
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail to the commission: in ten years he received gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes totaling $736,000 in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he overstated.
Other officials responsible for building roads admitted that they were getting on their feet, inflating bills by 30-40% using fake add-ons.
Then one organizer from the mayor's party, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party cash registers with dirty money.
Following the revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to sound the alarm.
The mayor of Riviera de Preary County in the east of the island, she has opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal plot, bought for 5 million dollars and resold for... 1.6 million developers at the height of the construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which will eventually be launched, she "pulls a thread to understand the functioning of the system, teeming with ants, to stop gangrene and identify the culprits."
It is characterized by this process as "painful but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we get home.
regularly.
Jacques Duchene notes, for his part, that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who knew about this scheme" but were not involved in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in campaign finance in quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The government of quebec proposes to limit to 100 dollars of donations to parties, but, in his words, it will not change the situation: "Until we strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He calls for a complete overhaul of the system of granting public contracts and party funding: "We cannot go down; by boldly getting to the bottom of things, we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy."
If this story casts a shadow over the international image of quebec and Montreal, Mr. Ducheno encourages those who laugh to look into their own court ...
"PSG - not FC Barcelona!"
This season you have achieved an extraordinary scale at PSG.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but can - and a new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up next to them every day.
The technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not falling apart.
From the very beginning at the NIF pre-training centre in Clerfontaine and before I came to Saint-Etienne, I always stepped forward.
So you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer is not a novelty to play matches of a very high level.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me, wants to be on the level and give their best.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti provides support in my positioning.
He is assisted by substitutes like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the master of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technical staff.
Today in the First League he has no equal and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience and has won many titles with high-class clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
Then I walked away from a whole series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the First League, Lyon took our place as leader.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we effectively qualified for one-eighth of the final.
What is the club's goal in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can be.
We will be able to have our say face to face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, to be able to take the return match in one eighth final.
Will PSG be able to become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate positions for the long term.
Today it is not.
Financially, PSG has the means to make this project real.
Not to take the title in the First League, as last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to get this title.
Last season we were close to that.
In May, it was disappointing because we had everything to come to the finish line first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
Typically, 79 points involves the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, has played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have entered the fight for the title, I think that we have the strength to win.
Don't you think that the media expect too much from PSG?
It is normal that a lot is expected from us, given how much has been invested and what kind of players we have.
We are fully prepared for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find something to criticize, of course, it's a bit frustrating.
We wonder what people expect from us in the first place.
We can never win every weekend 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement a draft game.
The team is formed over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we can meet modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who have been unable to reach the eighth final for two seasons, although they have also spent a lot of money!
Taking into account the amount invested, we represented you 15 points ahead by the winter break.
It would be a disregard for our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not on top last season, were "awakened" by this new PSG.
It shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we won as a result.
PSG seem to be completely dependent on the exploits of Ibrahimovic.
Well, what if they say that there is a kind of "zlatan addiction."
It just means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He's come for it and he proves he's a Premier League star.
Wherever he played, he showed he was a great player and a world-class star.
In the group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
It encourages others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with the French national team?
How frustrating.
I was eager to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from snatching some game time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out of there stronger.
Today I manage to play good qualifying matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized by the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and now we have to behave exemplary.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first months at the helm of the Blues?
They're good for him.
He has a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players and he inspires to win.
What was Laurent Blanc like.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us in the Euro.
I hope didier Deschamps brings the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved draw (1-1) snatched on October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, in my career there were no such matches.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The exact opposite of the current cash exchange, based on central banks, numbered transactions between receiving parties with commissions on their processing.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, there is an obvious political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is simultaneously a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros...) and a protected BitTorrent-type exchange protocol that allows file sharing between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins for donations or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate, having reached a high of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell five months later to $2 before returning today to about ten dollars (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing special in comparison with the world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) became interested in the system in its report on the virtual currency published in October.
He describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, like the "credits" used to promote in a video game that are earned during the game or which can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always monitored and handled by any central body.
In Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both account holders, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses, similar to an email.
Only for each new payment can the user choose a different address, thus providing anonymity.
The informationset pertaining to this transaction is signed electronically using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction do exist in a public account book sent out throughout the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It goes through a mathematical problem sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, is privileged to add this new line.
We are talking about the hashing phase of the file, i.e. converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hashing" all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (lots of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes can easily verify that it is correct.
The transaction thus turns out to be unreactably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, with the aim of deception, the user would want to pay twice with the same money for the purpose of deception, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem receives 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the award is regularly split in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one hundred million, which leaves another reserve ...
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in processing power.
The life of the network has already experienced the ups and downs.
Bitcoin service sites were attacked and bitcoins were stolen from reserves.
"The defect used does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noise, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes payments with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this disadvantage.
Big players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the counting book and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
"Giant sales" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works at Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noise, another author of the currency manual, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions that thus comes out cheaper.
The holder has better control over their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who don't need to install new devices or software.
It is enough to give the address, which can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, says Pierre Nooisa, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will be some time before Bitcoin is approved, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to review the various risks considered to be elevated today, if the system is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not just for us.
We suffered mainly Afghan peasants, whom we regarded as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case under the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will no longer be as soon as the West behaves more delicately.
The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the height of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to The French credits, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul since the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At the time Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants, in which they were surpassed by Al-Kaida, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become dealers, taking advantage of state lands to resell them for development to returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of huge American subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I've heard in rural areas, want a government that's not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have managed american generosity will leave: capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and are watched everywhere.
At the moment there is an army.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, who led the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures to restore provincial militias that would not submit to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, must be to some extent decentralized, modeled after Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister that had existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, depended on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, state control over infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumours that Afghanistan had enormous mineral wealth.
This only reinforced the feeling that Western countries were there only to take possession.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper in place, without the means of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper deposit, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the province's largest employers.
It is also necessary that, one day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend heavily, to restore normal relations equally.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: the Lyceum for Girls, for Boys, the Faculty of French at the University, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "conquer hearts and minds" and fulfill the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the "military-civilian" service under the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous community work and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of the local labour force, were able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection and increased arable land.
What will we leave in memory of ourselves, spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, which are often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural work from local communities in The Province of Kapisa.
To get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, which farmers want, as they told me, they need to provide them with a little non-military support that is well controlled and directly addressed to them.
The difficult birth of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky move by President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever on the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, he has decided to play all-in.
Forcing everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to finish the work.
It is soon two years since Egypt relied on a preliminary text that has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delusions", continuing to "violate the word" and "to trample on the right".
In the camp, his followers believe that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time, which forces the Brethren to abandon the intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, the call for an accelerated vote is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I leave myself extraordinary powers", which are supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to convey their views.
Representatives of human rights advocates, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, spare participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, were amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around... time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the Constituent Assembly clock was incorrectly configured.
The text on which the vote was still taking place yesterday consists of 234 articles.
Subject to public attention, Article 2 ultimately remained identical to an article from the 1971 Constitution that stated that "sharia principles are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is a basic requirement, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules" that would allow for their stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" - answer liberals who see it only PR.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They point in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular, in verifying compliance with Sharia law.
According to Sophie Pmier, an expert on Egypt, this is alarming because "people called to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can observe the birth of the theocracy."
Many liberals, moreover, are excited by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be much less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment there is no specific religious intervention.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulema, but people with university education, some studied in the French system" - soothes Alexis Blow, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "there may be ambiguity around Article 220, as the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to "fikhs" .Islamic jurisprudence.
And in the future, it may be a question of how competent civil judges are to rule on it."
In addition to its religious dimension, the text adopted yesterday has been criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they have been significantly reduced compared to those under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, consideration of the defense budget will take place not in Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
The trial of civilians in military courts will also not be prohibited, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they considered detrimental to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy was maintained and insults were no longer prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles speaks more about protecting a woman, said Heba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, poop of the Earth and the sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths, the modern comfort and pristine nature.
AIF highlighted five of the most important reasons to visit Israel.
Let's bow to the holy places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all who enter this "coup" condescend to God's grace.
And Galileo is the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of all the shrines in Jerusalem.
Believers here pass the Path of Sorrow or the God's Way of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoriume - where there was a court, and on the streets of the Old City leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Calvary - to the place of the Crucifixion, the Stone of the Anointing and the place of the burial of Jesus.
Here is also the symbolic Christian Pup of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was erected on the place where, according to Christian legend, grew a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest place for Jews - the Western Wall, left over from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave notes here with desires, which are then fulfilled.
Take a vertical journey
The ruins of the fortress of Massada were left from a secret refuge from enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on sheer cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above the ocean level.
And only those who are fond of mountaineering can get to them in their own way.
The rest of this historic peak is delivered by a cable car lift.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
A shuttle bus takes you from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly lived pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't go to everyone in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, is worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea scrolls found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
His exhibition features paintings by impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bath al-Basha, which is a few halls of ancient Turkish baths with imitations of visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea, you should go to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no guides and souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells the story of one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section - a children's memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars flicker.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Healthier
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and aquariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea bathe even in the winter months, because the water temperature there does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and there bathe all year round.
By the way, this most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below the ocean level.
Azure water in it - brine, easily keeping afloat even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes around are unrealistically beautiful.
They come here to undergo treatment with salt water - rapes, and healing mud, and to treat health in dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to put in order the shattered nerves.
Touch the mysteries of antiquity
They are kept by an ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it passed the famous Sea Route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legends, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander through the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of "his" sign, Fortune will be favorable.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries for a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can wander through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourist on a note
Going to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population know Russian.
It is better to take money for the trip not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now $1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram, and Haifa is the only metro line in the country consisting of six stations and linking the Lower City with the Upper One.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
Travel in all modes of urban transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive with transfers for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport are shut down.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels only have kosher food that excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes that combine milk and meat.
It offers a large selection of dishes of lamb and beef, soups and desserts cooked on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta hummus, a variety of sauces, balls of ground chickpea - falalel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are a lot of fattened cats, which are "walking on their own."
In the evening they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Purrs love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37. (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15. a day.
A bike rental will cost 15 nis. a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
In 2012, Israel was visited by more than three million tourists from all over the world.
Citizens of the Usa, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to travel and rest the most.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Great and mighty" will bring to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While MPs and human rights activists argue that will give the law on mandatory language testing, in the country there are already fraudsters selling "fake" certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left behind.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every migrant worker will be required to take an exam on russian language proficiency.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service, housing and utilities, life and retail.
However, over time - promise in the FMS - tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
Moreover, not only the language, but also the Russian history, and the basics of legislation will have to be surrendered.
Language proficiency will have to be confirmed in order to obtain and renew work permits.
The exception applies only to citizens of those countries where Russian is the state language.
People who managed to get certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not covered by the law.
Benefits, doom and protection of rights
The network of examination points will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by both the State Duma and the FMS.
But human rights activists, before the law came into force, many times had time to ask the press a question: what, in fact, will it give?
What will change the obligatory knowledge of the language for both Russians and visitors?
First of all, - the representatives of the migration service answer - this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
Many people are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, head of the Russian Navy's office in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems arise in migrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language, do not have a medical certificate.
Without understanding the language, - Sebelev is sure - the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who under the guise of help will put him "travel" in a terrible cramped barrack, where he and dozens of his ilk will languish for months without food and documents, working 12-14 hours a day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"At home they are promised one thing, and on arrival they are deceived, their passports are taken away, they do not pay the promised salary," confirms Tolib Sharipov, head of the Main Directorate of Labor Migration of the Ministry of Labor Migration of Tajikistan.
Don't swear, snug!
However, so far, many citizens of Central Asian republics, going to work in Russia, admit that not only do not know the language of the country in which they aspire, but also write on their own with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even sensible primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to even feed their children, not to mention to dress them decently, to dress and equip them in school.
Growing up to adolescence, such guys at the first opportunity go to work.
It's hard if it's bad with language skills, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the language law, human rights defenders point out one important point.
Testing will only be carried out for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Outsiders are not allowed in"
Many of the visitors claim that it is not so easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But the fake registration can be done quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence cases of extortion.
"They ask for a hundred, two for cigarettes and tea," Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Fly, don't skimp, buy painting"
On the first day of the language law came into force, it became clear that it was not only migrant registration documents that were false.
Several "fake" certificates of language tests have already been withdrawn by FMS employees.
Fake papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they got to the new owners for good reason: each of the migrants, who hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as expensive as the formal testing procedure: it will cost a migrant worker three thousand.
The authorities and human rights activists agree that the main task in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the "crusts" cannot be bought.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise guest workers who failed to successfully pass the test the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Interior Ministry does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry proposes to tighten the law against owners of civil weapons.
It's the government's reaction to recent incidents: the shooting at weddings when there were no casualties, and the massacre by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of injuries in public places and raise the age at which a gun licence can be obtained from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be introduced in the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by "tightening the screws".
An open letter has appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demand to abandon the "senseless tightening".
The percentage of hooliganism with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasily Lesnikov, a forensic lawyer, told the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the six months of 2012, 142 crimes with firearms registered with the internal affairs bodies were committed, while in the same period 1168,000 crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are sure that the tightening of legislation in the field of civil weapons does not put the criminal to go to the "black" market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapons at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry claims to be in control of the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The "black" arms market is replenished through several channels.
The main such channels are five, says retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a site that takes orders for weapons
The first is an "army or military footprint," that is, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were carried by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranets said.
The next type of "black weapon" - stolen by criminals from the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes both those taken away from police warehouses and stolen from law enforcement officers.
Illegal "stems" go on sale from military warehouses.
Many military warehouses often had explosions.
"There are proven versions that some of the arson was made specifically - to cover the shortfall," says the former military officer.
According to Baranz, arms manufacturers make their contribution.
"Now private arms factories are producing, which can not withstand competition in the international market and throw weapons from under the floors on the black market, including Moscow," the expert says.
Another source of the "black" market - smuggling.
Especially a lot of guns and assault rifles from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production, sometimes artisanal, and formed a mafia, which organized the flow," - explains the former military.
Where did the gun come from?
Experts considered what an approximate proportion of each source of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Experts analyzed the reporting of the Interior Ministry and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data of portals on weapons issues.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, come from the army and security agencies.
Half of all guns on the black market ended up there "at the fault of officials whose work is related to guns," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases there are thefts at the stage of arms production, 5% are in "black archaeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the gun shops, who asked not to be named, assures that the weapon found by black diggers, for a long time no one buys - too old.
Most often, he says, for a new batch sellers go to a military warehouse.
Through the warrant officer, a person buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
He's being discharged, passed over the fence.
"He transports it to the city and here sells for 900 euros apiece with two shops," he says
"The police are aware of all cases, so periodically when the plan to solve crimes is lit, conducts a control purchase from illegal arms dealers," the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the sites, in blogs, until a friend responded, who offered to come to the platform "Begovaya" where there will be a person who will take me to the "corner" where we will bargain.
The price of the barrel I learned only there
military columnist Victor Baranets
To get a gun I need an acquaintance who has a way out - says the seller-consultant. - I have such a friend, but I'm not sure about him.
Sellers in the markets are, but there also need to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that his daughter's tooth fell out."
I'm even getting a couple of brass knuckles right now through a man I'm sure of.
He only supplies them to me, too, because he knows I won't turn him in.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing an article about it for publication.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with photos where "anything" was.
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the military man recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranz, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I, a potential customer, do not just buy - we go with the seller in the woods, there put a target.
"I am given the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that the weapon strikes well, we start to bargain," the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the sofa
Searchers on the Internet take to the sites and groups in "Vkontakte" where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
No documents or face-to-face meetings are needed for this.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," - write in the advertising cap on the website "Buy a gun or machine gun."
On it, users leave their applications and ask questions.
Will the minors be sold?
"Without a license of course," asks the user "Ivan" (the spelling is saved).
"Buy TT.Moscow" - succinctly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of front sites and those who want to buy combat weapons rake with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish to bait, and then mine coal in Siberia

I have heard about such schemes: usually the site is registered outside of the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes a payment through the ATM.
"In response, they send a photo and instructions, where the weapons are hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the Right to Arms NGO.
Victor Baranets claims that leaving the application on the site, you can be left without weapons and get behind bars.

Makarov for $100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, you can meet the amount of 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of Right to Arms, a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the management of these middle-level warehouses.
According to the official stastist of the agency, compared to January- October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of detected cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers on strike in U.S.
Up to a quarter of all American teens go through mcDonald's box office work
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages at Walmart department stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken have swept through America.
So far, no one is going to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth shaft or it is destined to exhale in the early stages.
The rallies are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing ngos.
In addition to raising the modest salaries paid by ordinary Walmart employees and fast food systems, the purpose of the protest organizers is to create trade union organizations in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The stock began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, when America was hit by an of cheap sales, capturing millions of people and sometimes being accompanied by scuffles.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and picketed with unions and left-wing activists, the corporation's stores, whose merchandise is designed for people of modest and middle income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores on average from 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many low-wage Walmart employees only get their jobs.
The availability and range of products have made Walmart one of america's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell cheaper goods in part because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, such as a shortage of forklifts or hand scanners.
Black Friday protesters demanded a pay rise and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker who gets $9.5 an hour is unaffordable, they said.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, argue that if Walmart raises its average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1 percent more than she spends on her salary now.
If Walmart completely shifts the increase in wages on the shoulders of customers, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more expensive.
For a year they will spend on some 12.39 dollars more than now.
Walmart supporters say the protests have occurred in just nine states and have done little damage to the corporation.
"Black Friday" continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, during which time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Rep. Dan Vogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was just "another PR stunt" organized by the union.
"Free cash!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart department stores (they are not complaining in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), and "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and after that it doesn't even give you sick leave and doesn't pay you for an honest job!
Jumaine Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $7.25 an hour.
Fast food restaurants increase it over time, but not much, and on average their ordinary workers earn $8.90 an hour in New York.
No one earns less than them in this expensive city.
How you can exist in New York for such money is incomprehensible to me.
Once upon a time, almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked behind their shelves after school, living with their parents, passed through McDonald's.
Few people saw this as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I constantly come across interviews with McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on the forum of the Wall Street Journal hangs a comment, the author of which notices that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know what you will feed them.
The protesters, which began at 6.30am on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast food cashiers and chefs start paying at least $15 an hour, more than doubling their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the fast food industry.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing trade union activists with nitpicking and firing.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is difficult to cover fast food by the union for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary turnover of personnel.
Dissenters
Noisy protests took place that day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The rally culminated in a mid-afternoon rally outside McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians, including city council member Jumaine Williams, spoke, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and after that it doesn't even give you sick leave and doesn't pay you for a fair job!"
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as the city's mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we must stand together in support of fast food workers so that they can achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described what happened, it was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But it involved only a few hundred people, and not all of them were employees of fast catering, which employs tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will create a flame of mass movement.
"As long as the brain cheats is average"
Popular among fans of modern technology theme augmented reality recently it is customary to perceive mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First, at its annual conference, the current model was shown by Google, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had applied for the relevant patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory Of Microsoft Sharam Izadi it follows that for scientists of this company glasses - passed the stage.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Please tell us, in general terms, what your research team is doing?
"We are engaged in human interaction with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity is in the mass stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes poking in them with a finger.
We want to look for 5-10 years ahead and predict radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is not for sale, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
What else is ahead of us?
- Although Kinect has moved the interaction to a physical level, a lot of things still happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not yet very.
We're trying to change that, working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on a variety of technologies, including design.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, to make it more tangible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient way.
And first of all - to hell with these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
Popular thing, but don't they overestimate it?
- It definitely can not be called a panacea - there is a question of privacy, because you do not always want to notify others about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone is in their own niche.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not over sweeping, and on such stingy, short.
At the same time, the gestures were filmed not by the camera of the device, but by a wristband, which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
While it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is followed by a mixed type of management, such as a gesture and voice.
"Is that what?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
"I usually just say.
"Oh, it's going to be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what a machine can or can't at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we will basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will more accurately determine human reactions.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it is very important.
- When it comes to your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your concerns about modern cameras?
Not enough resolution, depth or something?
- In principle, the current generation is something that can be started in our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at a speed of 1000 k/s.
But it's not about the megapixels themselves, it's about the matrix and depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - it adds work to the designers of algorithms.
That is, we should remember not only about the permission for the X and Y axms, but also about the X and Y.
Speed, number of frames per second are also very important.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s frankly small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betises of our Redmond Laboratory made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I would be very useful in my work equivalent of such a device, but does not require touches, so that the frames per second was more.
- Don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cameras," one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the other is a reflected signal receiver.
But the third camera is, in fact, the usual sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of an object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how this will help in 3D position definition.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technologies glasses - this is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time walking around, holding a smartphone in raised hands, is not very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be "passing" augmented reality, when on the basis of a cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, projection display and then everywhere.
Glasses - a very personal device, this is their strength (private things see only you), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only tony Stark from "Iron Man" but also a mere mortal.
There is one problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tactile feedback!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers is your team preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine.
I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks - the use of the second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
It perfectly registers clicks!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at giving these "pictures in the air" touch - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point, where the finger is, gives a feeling, but so far it is very weak - as if you put on the pads.
There are bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
Did you try to cheat the brain?
Make him think he feels something he seems to feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried to do that yet.
Here lies another task, which will be fought for a long time - how to make a person physically in a very limited space, to believe that he is going on an open, almost infinite - and working on the concepts of treadmills (not the same as in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
While cheating the brain turns out to be average, the work is still very much for many years.
That's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to a researcher - many things are in their infancy.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, in the vanguard of culture and art.
In this top list have already got bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" - shocking artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man dressed in all red, which is found at the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, then at fashionable parties and vernissage.
Cyril Miller's paintings always gather crowds of spectators, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the strictly St. Petersburg social-philosophical storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, his appearance on the streets causing a smile at the citizens, lifting everyone's spirits.
Recently, he took a charmer and became a St. Petersburg charmer, as he was ripe for this difficult role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you still walk around the city in all red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a fashion designer, engaged in the view and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image-maker and society.
Although in society everything that is a little gray, causes aggression and excitement of unkind properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to a discussion.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in Nevsky DC, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that this is my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and new, free type of me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-Gazonshchina, which led to "Pushkin-10" and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into the theater, clothes, music, all genres except the word.
- And all this was united in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the center of culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995 I occupied the territory on Pushkin-10, and there, while there was no repair, there was a music and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: NOY, Tequila-jazz, I remember how Schnur was brought with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh."
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, they were in tight tights, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs before the Hali-Galiv times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and went to his great career, and the basic education and upbringing he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboedov - these are echoes from the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regulars left there.
I'm the hero of the age of yesterday, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was "People of our city."
In the category "Artist of the Year" was named I, ended my climax.
In the new times under the old rules it is uncomfortable to work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are shared, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
"Your work has a recognizable manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a pronounced urgency and sharpness.
I'm going to have a program exhibition, the Russian Museum in Clowns.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now to be so - it hurts and scary.
But in clowns everything is smeared, tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian dressing in order.
Now on clothes meet, focusing on the external mechanics, and not on the inner person.
Or maybe he can't give a hand and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing clothes.
"And recently we saw you as a city charmer. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who better than me to be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art should be neat, tactful, sweet.
Cultures are being disintegrated.
Previously, people flocked to the pack, bohemians loved one thing, simpletons another.
Now everyone has broken into micro-communities, now it is difficult for everyone to like.
I'm not a hundred-dollar piece of paper to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who's going to like you.
Now each cult hero has 100 fans.
" And several thousand people come to Stas Mikhailov!
- Throws come to it, there the sex-social sphere works.
And on cultural grounds 300 people will come, and 10 thousand will not come, and in the end less management, money, everything will wither.
I have fans, the main thing - they do not deceive, do not spoil the acquired.
I used to paint such paintings as a young man that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with the pictures that usually end up.
Now concepts are often confused.
They say: culture is spiritual, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of drawing paintings.
I'm for this kind of culture.
- Kirill, what does St. Petersburg lack?
Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: an official from culture.
But not every one of them can engage in culture.
Under the right kings everything was wrong, the kings may not have understood the culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow right now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are pushed, as we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and give them a way.
Now the taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but what distinguishes them is that they honestly say that not all contemporary art we accept, there are such artists who should look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil there.
And it is difficult to grow art on our stones.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers than readers now, that's wrong.
There are a lot of people curious in Europe. that go to exhibitions, concerts.
We've got this layer of thin.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented with the funds of the St. Petersburg grant
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board go in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question arises, how to continue your family in the conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think there's not much choice.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Surdin, a senior researcher at the P.K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAISH).
But if the conditions on Mars are more livable, the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can live only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Approach to the issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
Half a century ago we conducted experiments on plants.
Four generations of pea grown in orbit were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then there is the excretion of insects, tiny fruit flies-drozophile.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to test how the embryo develops in weightlessness.
We get on the way out a completely normal chick.
And then the problem begins.
"The problem is that this chick has to find a support, he has to stand on his feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Not finding a support, the chicks were randomly tumbled.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a complete atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to light and sound.
And there the trouble was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we hatched chicks, then refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," - says the failure of the experiment with chicks in space Vladimir Sychev.
The last time a biological "miniceng" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only same-sex individuals will be on the Bion biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space with the fruit.
Basically, there was nothing supernatural.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again - it's a single experiment, and such research should be carried out," - Vladimir Sychev notes.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
But it is not yet possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply can not realize their sexual instinct.
A man, unlike animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a proper emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkova had the biggest risk.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is a female organism.
Our Seagull has gone, and no one on Earth could say whether it will survive after the flight into space.
Will she be able to have a baby after this flight.
"No one answered this question," said Vakhtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the space flight, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father Andriyan Nikolaev was also an astronaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who had been in orbit twice and even worked in outer space, had a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, few cosmonauts, who after long flights all went well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," - sums up the cosmonaut pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to find some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creation of artificial gravity.
The CPC Hydro laboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here, in conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their skills in outer space.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults water, albeit comfortable, but still alien environment, then for infants - the native element.
Little ichtianders seem to confirm - life on dry land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months in the mother's fertilized liquid, it is easier to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bathing, takes only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for the child born, then for a woman - gravity is necessary.
Very quickly in weightlessness decrepit muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, falls the ability to push the fetus.
Okay, let's put it down, and that's relying on generic stimulants.
You can, of course, in a special cell to go to childbirth, she will push him.
"And then what?" asks Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth's attraction, the body will not form a skeleton and muscle system.
It is impossible for a newborn in orbit, as an adult, to wear a special load suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what he will need.
"And this experiment, which we will go to, allowing the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled, completely disadapted person," - predicts the head of the committee on bioethics of the IMBP RAS Igor Pestov.
While the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while it will be a reality when earthlings on their ships will go to a distant planet, which will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief of the General Audit Office: Checking the Schwartz system failed due to the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement industry, the Czech Republic has good controls and, despite the existence of quality legislation, lags behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for the Aktuálně.cz website.
"The law will never be perfect, but it should be applied correctly, which I think we lack," Kala said.
Such conclusions are provided by a joint inspection of Czech and German control bodies.
Peter Nechas's approach to the so-called Schwartz system is an example of improper practice.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with inspections - is it banned or allowed?
"The law must be established in any way, and if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the institutions charged with checking and enforcing obligations," Kala said.
At the audit committee meeting in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which compared the public procurement legislation of both countries.
What exactly was it about?
I mean a parallel check that we started, probably two years ago.
Simply put, the fact that European law approves how public procurement should be carried out follows national legislation and then also applied in practice.
All the information was collected and, even with the unfinished inspection, there were interesting differences - to put it simply, the legislation can be "accurate and unmistakable", but in the practice of application we are in some respects inferior to Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
And actually how this project can help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this kind of joint control that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the appropriate stuff for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it is not a fact that we will achieve this by reducing the restriction of orders.
Perhaps this system will be overflowing with "papers" so that those who wish to find loopholes in this system, will find them much easier than if the restriction is not reduced.
You are talking about internal problems of practical application of public procurement legislation.
And how does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization like our CRU (Audit Office) or does it work differently?
As for the institutions, the Bundesrechnungshof, based on our principle, is the same as our CRU, and there is also a panel that works a little differently, but most of the time both institutions operate in a similar way.
In addition, the powers are somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at the level of federal lands - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal counting chambers.
As for local law, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it is not certain that it is better in everything.
Is that because they're better at controlling?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from working with our office, right?
In the case of domestic legislation, how have the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affected your institution, and are there any consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet manifested itself in our work on control.
Since we are monitoring the fact, we need to take some delay into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future inspections - we have started to use our new tool "detection of the risk of non-economy" through which we have driven almost 14,000 government contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will manifest itself, because the restrictions are changing, the conditions of some types of tenders are changing, and so on.
Do you think the approval of this law will benefit or put an additional strain on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be tightened and cannot be enforced.
In the operation of previous rules, controlled enterprises are associated with the supplier (e.g., regional operational programs - with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is it necessary to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think that's the way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not influence the decision.
Such a system would only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP would not bother entrepreneurs with inspections of the so-called Schwartz system. What does that mean?
Is the "Schwartz System" banned or allowed?
The law must be established in any way, and if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the bodies charged with verifying and enforcing obligations.
You could say, "We're going to change this law and let's do it," but we can't say we're going to pretend that nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains quite strict rules, as well as what should be formally conducted, and rightly so. This will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it should be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
Roads are sometimes slippery, but mostly passable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snow-covered.
They are mostly passable, but in some places with more caution.
Carlovar Region
This morning in the Karlovar region the roads were passable, but in some places frozen and snow-covered.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day should gradually warm.
Snowfall in the region has stopped, only in the lowlands lies a small layer.
However, there are about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
From the information received from regional road workers, it became known that in some places there was a lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 expressway and first class roads in the region are currently passable without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third class, including mountain tracks, are passable.
But in some of their areas there are still remnants of frozen and in some places of snow.
You need to be especially careful on the roads located on the hills.
Pardubitsky and Kralovegradetsky region
The Management of roads and highways of the Czech Republic on its pages on the Internet informs that some roads in the eastern Czech Republic are threatened with ice, and on mountain roads and roads located on higher elevations, there may be a jaded layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers about ice, which can form especially on the hills of the Pardubitsky region.
Ice can be near Lanscroon, Usti nad Orlici, Polici, Sweetavi or Visok-Mito especially on the roads of the second and third class.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located near Sweetavi, are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Krkomoce and Orlitsky mountains.
A covered layer of snow is found on roads located on higher ground in the areas of Richnov-nad-Knezhnow and Trutnov.
In the Eastern Czech Republic today variable clouds without precipitation.
Temperatures usually range from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region this morning are passable, but sometimes you need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning it is frosty, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places can be slippery.
In some places drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by regional road workers.
Highway D5 is now passable with virtually no restrictions, however, road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In the southern Pilsni and Takhov can come across frozen areas.
The roads of the second and third class are wet, and also in this case there is a warning in connection with the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the little-used roads in the Shumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the elevations of the Olomouc region must today take into account the snow porridge on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervenogorsk saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlsky Krszyzh.
At night, snowfall forced road workers to go out into the street, according to information from the road management, about three centimeters of snow fell in Shumperka.
In other areas, the edges of the road are usually passable without restrictions.
"There are remnants of snow on the hills of Shumperk.
Drivers heading towards Yesenik should bear in mind the presence of snow porridge in the Chervenogorsk saddle," the dispatcher of the Road Management told CHAN (Czech News Agency) today.
At night, their colleagues from Yesenika went to clear the roads, they assured that the roads on the hills after processing chemicals remained naked and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are passable without restrictions, but in Sternberk drivers should be careful in the forest areas, where the humidity is still maintained.
Ustetsky Region, Liberec Region
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are still some hard-to-pass places.
According to the information from the police database, in addition to a few places with ice or snow, a mountain road on the stretch from Telnica to Klinica in the Ustyck region is closed.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially to the southeast of the Czech Highlands, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Complications on the roads have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of ice in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - all day it rained and snow melted, at night the sky cleared up and frosts began.
Adverse conditions are reported on the main highways and on the I/13 highway on the border of Usetsky and Liberec region.
The branches of the trees surrounding the road itself were forced to close the road at Telnica on Knnica due to the branches of the road that were curved under a layer of snow.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is just one of the many disturbing news that we humans so easily fall on.
Together with The Tap Tap, we constantly joke about this topic and say that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell your readers more about it?
This is a national fundraising event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before this event, on December 20 at 21:00, three concerts will start in Prague, Brno and Ostrava in parallel.
They will end, roughly speaking, at the moment when the May calendar will end on kiribati island in the Pacific Ocean, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we all came up with together with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to accumulating enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to work with the public to reflect on the state of the world we will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be bought on the site www.e-tap.cz and thus at the same time to support us.
The tap band, along with other musicians, also sang an anti-doomsday anthem called "The End of the World Is Cancelled."
Will the anthem already loved by YouTube listeners be played at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if in the end everything will work out and the end of the world will not come.
It will be singed by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
The anthems will also be played live on Czech television at the same time.
The lyrics to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the music video by Tomas Ganak, participates in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start cooperating with them?
We also collaborate with other people of Czech cultural life, as we hold many charity events and concerts.
We try to actively connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to?
For the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, for the sixth year we have been working with the civil association Tap at the Institute of Edlichka.
Teachers regularly visit students of schools of the Yedlichka Institute and hold fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we try to give them this opportunity in this way.
As part of the project of additional construction of the Edlichka Institute in the future there will be a separate building, in which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiri Suhi will perform in Prague.
All the details can be found on the www.kpks.cz website.
Do you plan any such "grandiose events" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would love to have a performance at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally would like to perform in Washington and Chicago if we are in the United States.
As for abroad you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road in terms of organization and logistics??
It's not as scary as it looks at first glance.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their strollers must travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large number of cargo and boxes with tools.
However, so far we have dealt with it without problems. The Czech airlines and British Airways have always been perfectly prepared for us, which surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went without problems.
Thanks to travel abroad you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything functions better than ours, in Russia we have seen that the east is still at a basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are a lot of barriers in Moscow, and there is still a wonder of independent movement of a person in an electric wheelchair in the city center.
Also there are not in the course such banal things as to give way to a disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that try to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what, on the contrary, we constantly have to catch up with advanced countries?
There are so many things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people who are concerned.
In London and Madrid it is quite normal that people with severe disabilities independently move on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, and anywhere ...
It's not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we are a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or barthing is one thing, but when famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers appear among us, then things will really start to change.
So far, these are isolated cases - people with strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is now very popular, but back two years ago, what in 1998 made you organize it?
I entered the Edlichka Institute as a teacher, there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician myself and play the saxophone, he and his colleague organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, over time, as our presenter Lada Angelovich says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
Popularity has come only in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It is true, we were helped by the fact that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on the promotion of the group.
We have come to the conclusion that a work that no one can appreciate is essentially non-existent.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was there a goal to promote The Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential in being able to do something extraordinary.
The Show business is full of things imitating one another.
It is logical, everything new is taken with care, and lasts it for a long time.
There is very little rare stuff, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, pity, it is natural...
But this pity is completely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all abandoned personalities whom we should feel sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities do something, it's a shift not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Has success ensured that you are a strict leader, as many people consider you?
If we want to do the job qualitatively, we have to be in many things uncompromising and keep a certain discipline.
But I think it's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But this happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, the band The Tap Tap has twenty people.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Ladya Angelovich.
We are an open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno - in the club Fl'da and Ostrava - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a telepost at the time of the performance of The Tap Tap's song "The End of the World Is Cancelled".
The aim of this project is to raise 25 million kronor for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational center at the Yedlichka Institute in Prague.
A ticket to the concert costs 400 kronor, for children under 12 admission is free. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted by the 20th member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began working closely with ESA in 1994 and over the following years became active in a number of agency projects.
But the path to space Poland began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in flights to space, but this was not always met with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, of the lecture of A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his innovative work "Introduction to Cosmonautics" at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory.
Ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry and Andre Luis Hirsch Award for Introduction to Space in France.
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist of astronomy and space.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and written a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a well-known global propagandist of cosmonautics, and his contribution was appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the back of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway dredine equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket should have been used to disperse or brake the trolley.
Information about this dredus is known only from the press of that era.
In 1933, Polish artillery began to think about rocket arrows.
The study was carried out by the Armament Technology Section in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokzycki.
From the surviving materials it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photovoltaic fighter rocket, proposed by engineer Rogozinsky, appeared in the specialized press, and the following year the work of "Air Torpedo Missile and Aerial Bomb Missile" by the author Leliva-Kzhivoblotsky was published.
Both projects were designed for the military use of rocket engines.
Before the war, all projects of military use of missile technology were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation the work ended due to the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The society was first mentioned in the November 1954 issue of Problems magazine, which published four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that will deal with space.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (PAA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and in the autumn the POA became its active member.
And the following year, the first chairman of the POA, Kazimierz Sarankevich (1902 - 1959), became vice-chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in this position until his death, which came in 1959.
Since 1956, the POA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) meteorological rocket, which was the first Polish rocket to perform a scientific study.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, capable of overcoming a distance of 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, a two-stage RM-2 rocket was tested at the Bledov wasteland.
The missile was about 1.4 metres long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to observe the high-altitude wind.
But in 1962 further development was suspended.
The heir to the first RM missiles was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in size for the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 litres, the Meteor-1B was 0.34 litres and the Meteor-1C was 0.62L.
All three types had a maximum range of 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute developed the Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to bring a payload weighing 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Then versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee for Space Studies) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslav Hermashevsky became the second intercosmother after Vladimir Remek.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
The ruling sparked a lively debate in the community.
It would certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of labor (wage) there is a price stress.
By this concept it is necessary to understand the state when the manufacturer by delivering cheap goods tries to withstand in economic competition by "knocking down" the value of a competitor in order to take a large part of the market and thus increase their own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either the transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result, unemployment is rising in countries where the cost of labour is high compared to others.
Since private capital has no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it has produced, the inevitable social expenditures of the State are on the rise.
In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance of the masters of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social economic and social damage they cause in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Unceremonious methods of private capital create situations at the level of economies of individual states, when governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments give their own people to the private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the existing legislation.
The aim is to economically force their people to submit to the dictates of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool to curtail workers' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is rising and the difference between the poor and the rich.
In Germany for several years there has been a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves by their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are always cases when employed people receive such a salary that the state should pay them extra to get a living wage.
Such a scandal became known to the public in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people under pressure from the catastrophic fall of social status are forced either to emigrate, as they did in the 19th century, or to exist on a poor wage on the margins of society in the hope that someday investment private capital will come into the country.
But one wonders where it will come from.
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as the Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still working for a share of the European salary.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media argue ad nauseam that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the state should not interfere with the economy.
The next question is whether private capital, which is now practically managing politics and the whole state, is acting for its own selfish purposes.
The unequivocal answer is yes.
Proof is the existence of almost omnipotent and ubiquitous lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a desperate situation manifested in corruption, mutual benefit, in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that state ministries, because of the lack of funding, entrust the drafting of bills to private law firms, which are closely related to industry.
Then these bills are approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western constitution says, but from financial-powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly in such a situation, as described by Appian in the work "Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompeii": "The state has long been disintegrating, and agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribes, illegal receipt of favors with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to the elections with a pre-sold voice"... decent people did not run for the post of ruler at all, after all, one day the state was left without a consul for eight months." .. "Seriously began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need to choose an energetic person." Appian thought it would be Pompey, but it was Caesar, who finally changed democracy to autocracy.
As in ancient times, modern society is dominated by its own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital is no longer inherently intended for public purposes.
The current result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
So the reason for the emergence of fascist and communist regimes we must look for in the reckless liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be perceived as a pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is thus systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state's shareholding in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and can never come out" - Sting, the song "Fragile", where the main verse of the refrain are the words: "don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, they wouldn't exist" - the dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Meer Amshel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, generated many responses.
Some were in favour of Israel, arguing that it had the right to self-defence and that the Palestinians were terrorists, others supported the Palestinians, arguing that it was the racism of the Israeli State, the genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel being attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to speculate on who in these recurring waves of killings is the perpetrator and who the victim is, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation and have not witnessed the beginning of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to look at what the tensions that have been going on for 95 years (considering the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is first of all the history of the struggle for power.
In each epoch we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear - whether these people have always taken their own steps, or behind their throne was someone who directed their actions to pre-planned goals.
It must be assumed that we live in a period when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes from them could not have happened in a generation.
Among astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered as the head of a octopus (I do not know if someone is above them, but this is not excluded) - Rothschild.
They don't write much about them.
Certainly.
They bought the first news agency (Reuters) in the 1990s to stop rumours linking their name to criminal acts in the higher spheres in which they were in the shadows, and which always led to the strengthening of their power, the multiplication of wealth, or both.
They have large stakes in almost all the central banks in the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their shares, they are waging or preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian government took the central bank of their country in their hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of the central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began to issue his own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy started releasing his own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963. MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for unleashing the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for the three world wars created by the great Freemason of the 33rd level, Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was to destroy the monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and the third should reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume much resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can be nothing but except as a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, works, is to challenge the crisis and the subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao - order of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, which was to prevent a repeat of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia, starting the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, unreasonable in military and economic terms surrender of Germany (there was no need for war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there was a fragmentation of the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing on Germany huge military reparations, than created the precondition for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it was left only to throw the Germans strong enough, exposing the guilty and offering simple solutions to the Chief, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play, and really played the function of the fifth column , while igniting the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the founding of a zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the precondition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began to take place.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was initially held by bankers, or everything he did was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed of war third.
If international bankers manage to untie it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will become the victim of fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (to take only a sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all began with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
It is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are putting people to vote in elections exclusively their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister Hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers politician doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and given Iran's control over the Strait of Hormuz, containing 20% of the world's oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) - will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light now the words of David Rockefeller in 1994 are manifested: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept the new world order."
The New World Order in their view is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every person born at birth is implanted with a chip, with which he becomes a creature under total control.
"And it forces all small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have a mark on the right hand or on his forehead, so that a person who is not marked with the name of that beast, or the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
Here's the wisdom: anyone who has a mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the human name, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.
"Operation Argo" Movie: When Things Get Worse, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the ousted Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not supposed - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, it was not able to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations brokered by the Algerian Government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
Defeat in Iran contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After a difficult vicissitudes, they finished their way in the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them away from Iran, and helped by an extravagant legend of cover-up, according to which they left on Canadian passports as members of the film crew, looking for a place in the country to shoot a sci-fi epic.
A combination of genres
The plan, which was invented by "evacuation" expert Tony Mendes, required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the legend credible, specialized magazines wrote about the film project, arranged press conferences, a fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have long been kept secret, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "film-movieopus", the story of a successful idea, a scam - an example can be a number of films about Ocean's friends.
The film constantly changes moods - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the credits show the iconic historical photos of the events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lightweight Hollywood passages intersect with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then there are the scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating table, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck has had a wonderful career.
From the ridiculed actor became a respected director, and his play ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third feature film, after the dark detective "Goodbye, baby, goodbye" (2007) and thriller "City" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film Affleck, which is not filmed in the director's hometown - Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place at the same time refers to the qualities that elevated the director's earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in "Argo," where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, during the reconstruction of real events - the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy impress with its clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unforeseenness that arise when somewhere suddenly changes history.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues achieve in fictional scenes (fake headquarters at a Tehran bazaar).
There are too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narration does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He works quite successfully with this few, sometimes something to think about - there all this comes out not so elegant (scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at Tehran airport, and the chase on the runway look pretty far-fetched).
The downside of "Argo" is the absent-mindedness associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of drama, it's a film that can be watched with moderate interest, appreciating the staging and retro style that recreates seventies thrillers.
But it's hard to capture.
However, this is enough to remind you of one, still in a certain sense, living history, and to testify to how exaggerated the ideas about the almighty and omniscient intelligence services.
Balloon inflating rules, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com portal, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to declare a competition for "the most absurd ruling or project from the workshop of the EU".
"We are prompted by this latest event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," pollster Patrick Nager told Right.
Among the absurdities already nominated for the nomination is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rates of insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, women have had life insurance benefits because for insurance companies they are objectively less at risk.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop people can put forward for the competition before the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place until the end of February 2013," Nager said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which as a result harms nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of the cage for chickens, which resulted in a significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
The de facto ban on the use of the term "sandwich oil" or the removal of classic light bulbs from sale was also criticized.
High-quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under pressure from a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under threat defends the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show "abnormal curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission justified himself by harmonizing the existing disparate national rules that made trade more difficult.
The EU, despite resistance from some States, has nevertheless relaxed the standards for fruits and vegetables, citing the fact that the existing directives will lead to the waste of products.
A candidate to win the poll could also be last year's EU ruling, which requires that balloons sold must be supplied with a warning that children under the age of eight cannot inflate them unsupervised by adults.
The EU has turned to US research that balloons are a potential cause of death for children by suffocation.
This restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 who are not allowed to blow in fairgrounds.
Funny ideas are born and at home
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is rather absurd: everyone who has an official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, but should instead say "FYROM" (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists "Principle of Non-Intervention" (Laissez Faire), proposed for a vote, in addition to a few above absurd rules, such as the EU rule on the volume of food stocks in the membership.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food that can be in the Czech Republic on the day it joins the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it faced a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for the fact that they do not have the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies for applications for grants.
But these ideas originated in Prague, not Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSDP) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called intervention procurement, the State had full stockpiles that needed to be taken out.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to meet the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
Subsidies for the grant were offered to villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Nemz (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies had to go to the application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Fancy orders are the exception
While rulings in member states are easily criticized, the EU's efforts to regulate, as well as to better function and develop the European Union, are considered by many experts to be more recognisable.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the drawing of EU grants for projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with deepening European integration, but which member states have achieved in the discussion of the budget.
It is also a source of emotion among Czechs that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, retained the name "Olomouc cheese", but "The Native Rum", whose traditions in our country date back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename "Tuzemak".
Only products from cane distillate, not sugar beet, can be called rum.
The official list of registered EU products, along with the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from German Lubeck or Parma ham, have already included, for example, Carlovar breadcrumbs, Gorzhelitsky and Trshebon carp and harvest hops.
Pardubitsky gingerbread and Gorzhitsky tubes can also be proud of the EU trademark.
People want me to protect the republic, but I'm an amateur," Kamura said.
Mr. Senator, how does a man think of running for president?
I'm not thinking about becoming a senator or president myself.
If everything in our country functioned without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch how the country has been plundered over the last 20 years, how thieves are hustling, people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I'm forty years old and I'm an independent person who is not a member of any party, I have no other option to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you in this way?
I kept saying I'd be involved in the fight for the presidential lock depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
Later I specified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool by which I can exercise my views.
So I need the most influence and broad powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation murmur in our bar or at the TV, but at the same time are ready to trample anyone who will try to change something.
To this are added media, which denigrate people, and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, they said about me that I was paying bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiri Parowbek.
Let's get to your views.
You started the fight for the presidential castle with thesis about the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and about reverse property declarations worth more than twenty million.
To do this, the law must be changed.
You don't have such powers as president, and only a whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I lobbied as a citizen for excursions to become a free enterprise, it was promoted.
The problem is politice - when someone comes with a good offer left or right, they deliberately obstruct, and this deters citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much more potential to win support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country without party folding, without regard to dogmas.
Do you consider yourself to be a person who is more related to the right or the left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people think of me as a leftist.
It doesn't matter to me at all - a little left or a little to the right.
It's important for me that we move forward.
It's not about someone being right-wing, it's about the left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for the public, whether it will offer it to the HRC or the GDP, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get closer to.
You could call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already in place in the world, or are being talked about by eminent experts.
But without the support of the parliament you will be left only slogans.
And you won't last long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another option.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to their side, so that we achieve our goal.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would appeal to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, if they refuse, will have to tell why they don't want to.
If there is a strong personality who voices abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take direct presidential elections - it was a credit to public pressure.
I say directly that I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I'm just a beginner in politics, and for my program I will try to get the support of the majority.
I try to promote the business on my own; if that fails, I will finish in six years' time and return to the private sector.
It kind of sounds as if Kamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm the one I'm not going to do, so I've bypassed a number of famous people with an offer to run for senate.
I went to Radum Janchura, he refused due to the large amount of work.
I also at least supported the lead investigator, journalist Jana Lorenzova, who uncovered fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel on the scales.
Sixty percent of people did not go to the polls, and the majority of those who went elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two of us in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be implemented with difficulty.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about founding your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the purity of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money to do so.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, there are only twenty thousand kronor in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, but what about your own business with that?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of works of art for about 10 million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, and a few million more in the account.
By the way Aston Martin I had, because it was my boyish dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove a car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You drive an Aston Martin, you own $60 million in property and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million to campaign for.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my own pocket.
The campaign expenses will essentially cover the senator's salary.
But on this money I would not live, for example, could not pay my son for an English school, which costs 30,000 monthly.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So you're going to do business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to cut back on this?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the managing director of a travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a snrbre that would keep the republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get further.
And if I became president, I would have finished my business.

Architects MVRDV prove that real adventures are not only in the imagination - on the example of Speikenisse and his newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, we can finally see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, thinks, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself: why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad and e-books.
Now no one voluntarily goes to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Speikenisse, a little-remarkable sleeping town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they had the only opportunity to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Vini Maas of the Rotterdam Architectural Bureau MVRDV, a master of bold column charts and author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, treated the task with his usual calmness and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the members of the jury looked around puzzled and shrugged their shoulders, the brash Maas folded a pyramid of size from his original gift and concluded the speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear Citizens!"
Here it is, my suggestion: "Book Mountain" in Speikenis, the so-called Buquerenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain worth 30 million euros has grown.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground garage, supermarket, post office and several adjoining apartment buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, Book Mountain was awarded the second prize of the 2012 Best Library of the Netherlands competition.
The project also participates in the national Dutch wooden construction competition in 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which previously could not offer anything but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall, the white facades of which suggest the idea of a dairy, has become richer on one modern piece of architecture.
But the most important thing is that the first public building of cultural purpose appeared in Speikenis.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: book Eldorado under the cheese cap.
There is only one elevator in the center of the mountain range, because true fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
Glassed on all sides of the room - light and easily foreseeable, floors of burnt brick and elegant street lights unmistakably create the feeling of a public city square.
The urban environment is recreated perfectly.
The look is unwittingly looking for benches, dogs and football-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Usually bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless," says Vini Maas.
We turned the classic space configuration upside down and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The inner space of the book mountain is used skillfully: the center houses offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical facilities.
Especially please black bookshelves, which serve as a wall finish, parapets, then ladder railings.
Their look, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and civil engineers are lost in guesses, what is this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with secondary materials," explains Iop Trauborst, project manager representing the Speikenisse community, in accordance with the standard requirements.
And once at one agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness has been used as a lining for roots in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons, after which it can be thrown away.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was compressed into a panel four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, smelling a bit like a new car and a little sneakers.
There are 105 steps to the summit.
Anyone who crosses the path of almost 500 meters will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and wood ficus in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and first of all about the correct humidity on the literary mountain.
New soul costs
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite its many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trowborst.
The heat of the earth is used to heat it.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass cap, even on clear days the sun gets inside only for a short time.
Wide cleen wood farms, perpendicular to the glass facade, give shade and take on most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roll curtains.
Stefan Spermon, the IT skeptic mentioned above, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig has already been here.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who called Bukenberg "the soul of Speikenissa, which has long been lacking."
Reason: A few weeks before opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from their own congregation.
These books were to take up empty space on the shelves of the not-yet-fully-staffed library - at that time it had 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves are filled to the top.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Vini Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, now every resident has some connection with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it only serves as a decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal problem, which in professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Speikenisse wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
This is only the starting point for building an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin is teetering on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier in the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian bid for Observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in a vote to impose a no-fly zone.
As a result, NATO held the proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely moving from the policy, which, so to speak, was ruled by the United States, to the German foreign policy itself.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent unified policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that so far they are only groping their role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
The kind of foreign policy that France or Great Britain has.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a position in the national interest that does not depend on the position of the United States or Its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. on exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are very different from those of other major states, and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.
It therefore needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elites in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't attach too much importance to it, it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany harmed its relations with the United States by abstaining in making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the USA the understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as it was on the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect in this way.
After all, it signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be taken into account.
There are differing views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, by contrast, has clearly favored a veto.
Is there a divergence of opinion between the United States and many European states?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama government at heart has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But due to the local political situation, the government, of course, can not openly take such a position.
I believe that the significant differences of opinion are not as significant as it always seems.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you'll notice that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a united, consistent European policy, but now it is not.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and are forced to act instead on their own vision of the situation.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
It is clear that it is not easy for Germany, if only because of its ties with Israel.
This topic has always been sensitive.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they need to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it really take on the lead?
Or is the leading role still hard given to Germany?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes on an important role, there are a variety of anti-German feelings.
It's not easy for the Germans to deal with it.
Actually, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It should take into account a variety of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, the influence of the United States in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if you do not like it, unpleasant or strengthens dislike for you - such is life!

"Trademark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani will suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren - too.
But what is Armani Polo?
It is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies from which it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names are sued.
But even then it is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"It's becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to defend their trademarks in China," said Thomas Pattloch, an attorney with Taylor Wessing, a company specializing in trademark infringements in the Far East.
On my desk every week appears on a new case of this kind.
It is enough for imitators to add only a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci is Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
German companies, such as sporting goods manufacturer Puma, are legally copied in the same way.
Pattloch opens a folder with records from the trademark registration office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered there a trademark of zegna DF Puma, an artificial name, which also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights.
In large cities there are multi-storey department stores selling almost exclusively fakes.
But Pattloch's case is not like that. On behalf of his trustees, he opposes that Chinese enterprises quite officially receive from the trademark registration office the right to use the name, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "ban minpai," a brand-passenger.
This word is associated with "ban daquan."
That's what they call women who hunt rich men.
Chinese authorities plead not guilty
"It's damaging to business, it needs to be addressed," Pattloch said.
"The brand is eroding, the unique position is being lost, the image is suffering very much."
The financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are in the millions, especially for expensive copied products.
According to market research company CLSA, China, with sales of 15 billion euros per year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult to remove questionable records in the trademark registry and it is expensive.
The process can last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court rejected the claims, as after a long time the contested name became "the reality of the market."
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay plagiarist because he damaged his trademark in China, Pattloch said.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machine manufacturer Sany, a company that had recently acquired concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to the star Mercedes.
The Volvo-bought company Geely initially used a blue-and-white logo resembling a BMW; process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost out in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.
The TRADEMARK registration office of CTMO in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to a shortage of staff and equipment.
But last year there was a "return from an emergency in the working process to normal."
Thus, the number of unprocessed cases on objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
Fighting it is expensive
As is very often the least in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China for the tenth time in a row topped the list of new registrations around the world, the agency said.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees was paid.
To simplify, it means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth many times more to protest it, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting against Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to ensure that their illegal production of fake car parts was eliminated.
However, the simulator secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was an omission because names in Germany cannot be protected, said Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the trademark registration office CTMO rejected the Munich claim.
True, in both subsequent instances Freudenberg won, but the opposing side continues to struggle until now.
You have to be on the lookout.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs are hardly accountable, the company's archive had to review even the acts of a century ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a "large six-figure sum in euros" for the settlement.
"It's clear how expensive it is for us," Wentzler said.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spill over even into Europe.
Namely, if the imitators register unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather goods.
The concern has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this was able to prevent registration.
"You have to be on the lookout," Wentzler said.
Both he and Pattloh's lawyer recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark protection provisions, but rather foreigners should "do anything that should be protected in any way, register in China as well," Wentzler said.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed: If Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposite party licensing fees for his own name, Explains Wentzler.
Otherwise, we will be forced out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Trampling, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Choir of Imbonghi rehearses - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice in this.
The history of relationships that have covered a distance of more than 8,733 kilometers.
First there is a flood: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and men's sneakers pick up the beat on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only then slowly grow the voices of singers - viola, bass, tenor and soprano - they step, fascinate and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his cloth shoes as he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday evening, at the Music Hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir of Imbonghi rehearses a new song.
Fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years old came to the rehearsal, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor.
"Om"Obani" is not an easy thing, each voice of the choir has its own text, besides in a completely alien language: zulus, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that there are about 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland is home to 245,000 AIDS orphans.
At the same time, more than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitgeni, voices for Africa found chefs in Germany.
70 of them attend school, preparing for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take over the head.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch at the Goth Center.
Imbongs in zulus means narrator or praiser.
In this room they do not speak fluently on the banta, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been learning songs in this other way and even brings them back to where they first appeared: south Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8,733 kilometers of summer from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitgeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Infected forty percent
There live about 2000 people, some still in simple huts of clay and straw, among the inhabitants many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the ICH virus.
In Esitgeni, the disease of all of Swaziland is reflected in the miniature: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the foreskin in men, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than forty percent of Swaziland's population carries the immunodeficiency virus, and death in the middle of the fourth decade is not uncommon.
The choir opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the Imbogni participants saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but just everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first it was a private obligation of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity once a day to receive hot food.
But a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, which has since been almost professionally caring for AIDS orphans in Esitgeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Frequent viral STIs include HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Pubic pediculosis and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
What are the main hit groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that in at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany, transmission is the result of sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus are common in heterosexual adults.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Chlamydia infections are significantly more common among young people than among other populations.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
We also have a common human papillomavirus among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011, according to the Robert Koch Institute.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints about urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as bubbles or seals.
However, often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and go unnoticed.
How can I protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
After all, partially sexually transmitted pathogens can also be spread through contact infection and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, especially with frequent changes of sexual partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid long-term consequences.
Chefs, donations and not least fees for choir performances all over Germany allow you to collect something.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitgeni," said Annette Lennartz, the association's chairman.
In the village itself, money from Germany is managed by Tsova Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also ensures that orphans are well arranged, such as one of the grandmothers.
Gogues, as they call the zulus old women, is the mainstay of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that children in uniform every day appear in time for lessons.
Those who have no relatives go to the shelter to Haniycil, a lonely woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in conjunction with the American health organization PSI, organized HIV testing for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, prefer to be deeply silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
It is quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a state-sanctioned lifestyle also bears the blame for the fact that the ICH virus has spread so quickly in past years.
But it also lies with stray workers who spread the virus across the country.
There are free condoms on literally every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh."
To support cultural exchange a little, the Ibmogni Choir travels to sub-Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in black - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, happened, caused tears in the eyes of the harsh border guards.
The trip always leads also to Esitgeni, where the singers visit the children.
Despite the fact that the small village can hardly be found on the map, in the valley of the river Etzulweni it is more than known.
"Go to Esitgeni, there's light," the local people say.
And after the 8,733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the stomping singers return to the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also on fire here.
Messenger: NASA opens ice on Mercury
The Messinger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet can be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA's U.S. space agency has proven the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messinger probe has found evidence that the region of the planet, which is constantly in the shadows, is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Supposedly, water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid that collided with Mercury.
No one associates the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the probe's scientific director, Sean Solomon.
Temperatures on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life got to other parts of the solar system.
Inconspicuously, for The Earth's inhabitants, probes, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows in endless distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun beyond Neptune, Ceres, by the new definition of the international astronomical alliance from 2006, is not a "planet."
This fragment of the Spitzer infrared image represents a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, harder to identify pink "newborn" stars in the star circle.
This star formation region - scientists unromanically call it W5 - is discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This irerious heat of a dying star was photographed by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
A doughnut-like ring is made up of material that the star threw away while dying.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope took this photo of a galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with a telescope colors are better.
As the red eye winks at the observer the Snail Nebula in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
The resemblance to the earth's continent brought this nebula the nickname "North America."
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides expressive color transmission.
This new star in all beauty was photographed only with the help of infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they emerged - one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps it's fragments of Saturn's moon, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and clearest images of the Hubble Telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color, images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
A picture published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula, several thousand light-years away, in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-year, three-part), as dark dust bands divide into three parts the red-hot heart of the cradle of the stars.
In the constellation Of Serpentine, astronomers have photographed the harbinger of cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies rush towards each other and inevitably collide.
This is the birth of a star the Hubble telescope took off in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn't like technical abbreviations can call it "Southern Wheel."
A photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust particles that are ten to 100 times smaller than normal house dust.
This image was made up of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
The large spiral galaxy scientists call UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of new stars of our Milky Way.
The star cradle is constantly creating new stars.
This stellar cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, also constantly creates new stars - 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, only gas.
Researchers suggest that it originated shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe mostly had hydrogen.
Our views on the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey - even before Galileo Galilei began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more - and the spaces available to their eyes are getting deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
The "Big Binocular Telescope" has been installed in Arizona, USA.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescolio Canarias has a gigantic internal structure - the diameter of the mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The Mirror of the "Great South African Telescope" in South Africa is segmented - for the sake of reducing the cost.
However, it is about eleven meters in diameter.
Lack of inexpensive constructive execution: the telescope is rigidly fastened at a vertical angle - it limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature: high light-picking ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the "Finding Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing their processing power.
A view of the European Astronomical Service Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There is a "Very Large Telescope" here - fully corresponding to its name.
Its four mirrors allow to illuminate even the middle infrared spectrum in the visual tube.
The Chilean ESO Observatory also plans to install a European "Very Large Telescope."
Its main mirror should spread to as much as 42 meters - and will be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Kek telescopes on The Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into the sky with the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope - with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters - should appear on Mauna Kea.
Here they can be admired in the illustrations.
However, the most important species from space is supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been supplying paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for planets beyond the solar system - especially those where life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the mission began.
The photograph shows the last preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be sent to space until 2018 aboard the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it must search for the Big Bang by the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data about this, as "Messinger" rotates closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements over the decades indicated that Mercury had ice.
Thanks to the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to orbit Mercury - scientists are now confident.
Drink oil every day - and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically venerable age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
The search for clues in a country where 97-year-old elders seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically venerable age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
The search for clues in a country where 97-year-old elders seem relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
A minibus with thundering rolls along a winding road past dense forested hills, turbulent rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything around is so green and bright that you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the southernmost edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the Talish - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they speak great Farsi and Azerbaijani and differ in longevity.
The end point is Leric.
The small town boasts too heavy architecture of Soviet times, which does not harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost do not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth, to which the country owes oil to the Caspian Sea, here, to the province, has not yet reached.
However, Pilata Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Lerik.
"In May Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will have a festival of the world's oldest people," Fatulaeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
It documents the biography of about eight dozen talashes from these places, which are more than 100 years old. Fatulaeva points to a black-and-white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child
But the controversial star of the museum is shepherd Shirali Muslumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate, however.
And given that the oldest person, whose age is confirmed by the documents, was 122 years old, the age of Muslyumov seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973," Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children and allegedly had a daughter at the age of 136.
So did shepherd Muslumov add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of centenarians in Central Asia.
"It's amazing that a lot of older people can also be found in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," scholz says, "there are also very many very old people living in Sardinia."
However, due to the lack of documentation, scientific proof of age is not possible, as there were no civil registry.
Every day a glass of ghee
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the Lerica area are strikingly often reaching biblical age.
It is now home to 20 people over the age of 100.
Why are there so many centenarians here in the south?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with special thalys genes.
The director of the Fatulaeva Museum, on the contrary, believes that it is a matter of nutrition.
The Talish love meat, bread and most dairy products, many of them drink a glass of ghee every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it the primitive way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzoyeva lives in Chengemirana, a tiny village near the town of Lerik.
At 97, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasian region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Here, under the same roof live eight people, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and daughter, who have long had grandchildren.
Also nearby are two kids.
In the kitchen, guests are prepared tea, which is served in typical pot-bellied glasses of armud.
Mirzaeva has perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, under a headscarf she hides long dark blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals before us.
I always wash my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"I've never used shampoo," Mirzaeva said.
Monthly pension is enough for a living
She always ate only what grew in her own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought groceries in a store in my entire life.
She then talks about her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest part was after world war II.
But it got better when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the helm.
Propaganda doesn't often sound in an old woman's speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows almost no borders.
He was in power until 2003, then took the reins of power his son Ilham.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among The Elderly of Azerbaijan.
Mirzaeva receives 230 manats (approximately equal to the same amount of euros) each month as a pension, for local conditions this is the amount on which it is possible to live well.
And perhaps Mirzaeva's long-grown son is also right: "Old people in our culture are highly respected."
They live in a large family, are loved, surrounded by care and happy.
What's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is absent from the constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo show the deep division of the country.
The future constitution, based on sharia, met with fierce rebuff.
The Egyptian president did not skimp on pathos.
We have to create a transition.
"And its success rests on my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in the confused opposition, feel fear.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said that he had temporarily reduced the competence of the constitutional court and expanded his competence "to save the revolution."
However, what really wants to save the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles managed to drag in a late-night 15-hour race with obstacles at an Islamist-minded constitutional gathering of 100 participants, and this is partly a cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the proceedings are based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles" mean?
This was, and remains, a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists will use vague language and the resulting legal backlash to more strictly interpret Sharia law.
At least, this is hinted at by one new article: in all Sharia cases, al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamist institution with great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be brought to the council.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would de facto have the consequence of restricting the judiciary.
Much of the constitution is subject to interpretation
Another problem is that civilians should be held under military jurisdiction.
These courts during Mubarak's rule served to suppress the opposition.
Up to 11,000 civilians were held in military custody after the dictator was overthrown.
Also, as the draft says, the state should protect the "true essence of the Egyptian family" and "maintain its morality and values."
Legally, this is so vague that government agencies will be able to control even the content of film and literature with the help of this article.
In open text, this means nothing more than censorship.
In general, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
But the other forbids insulting and defaming the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording that "insulting people" is also questionable.
Will there be enough caricatures of the president or jokes about a lawyer?
The issue of interpretation, like much in this draft, which Morsi proposes to sign and which, he said, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The Revolution Is Back"
Opposition against Islamist supremacy has been forming for several weeks.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the document before it could take effect.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbaghy, who finished third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the international atomic energy agency Mohammed ElBaradei said the draft constitution had a place "in the dustbin of history."
Through Twitter's short news service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy."
"If he announces the referendum, we will go to his palace and throw it off," said opposition activist Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also said they did not want to observe the referendum, which would have rendered it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, out of precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after mass prayers on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under veils and adherents of Salafists, who shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded from Morsi: "Clean the country!" and assured: "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic square on which it all began provoked a state of almost civil war.
Morsi's followers obviously did not want to take this risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken loud and clear.
Now it's time to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should go.
Most for the project Islamists, it is considered a solved case.
"The concept of "human rights" is never mentioned"
Hafiz Abu Sayeda is furious at this forced constitutional process, which was actually supposed to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EDR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were imprisoned or tried under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivised for him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with Welt am Sonntag.
The expansion of Morsi's influence on all three branches of government in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures are a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civilian state, the de facto president annulled it," Syeda regrets.
After all, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Syeda feels that everyone has left it, even an international community that looks at the ideological struggle of directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be a reckoning for this.
A demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: "You are creating a monster that you cannot control."
Norwegian Rakfisk: the most smelling fish in the world?
Norway's five million people have one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but around the world.
Perhaps the mystery of the success of this country has something to do with the local addiction to one extremely foul-smelling fish dish?
Take a few overripe pieces of cheese.
Place them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You will have a smell-ing smell of Rakfisk - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
There are picturesque views around the snow-covered. It is very beautiful, but in the air spills indestructible characteristic smell.
Rakfisk is a trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for up to a year, depending on what kind of sweet thing you need to achieve.
As dusk thickens and it gets cold, crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this most, let's say, spectacular dish.
"They eat it raw and wash it down with a glass of aquavit, local cumin vodka," explains Havard Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and part-time "rakfika general" who directs the festival.
Everywhere around us people eat fish cut into small cubes and drink it with large portions of alcohol.
"Someone likes aquavit more than rakfisk," Havard says.
This drink is able to interrupt the smell.
I'm trying a couple of pieces.
If you manage to carry a piece under the nose, then everything is not so bad - not much different from the portion of sushi, which you took with you for a long time in the bus.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a completely different time, a time of poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish in the autumn soaked in hermetically closed barrels of salt water.
Then in the deep winter, when the fish was already well and thoroughly fermented, it was extracted and, muting the perception of alcohol, consumed in food.
It is still in the memory of the last generation that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, who are attracted here by jobs, high wages and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (a long-time rival, and not so long ago and much more affluent neighbor) come here to work.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, though somewhat foul-smelling element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and the majority of the country seems to be satisfied with it.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist and extremist who last year shot and killed 77 men, women and children.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called "the incident of July 22."
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
At the heart of Norway's current well-being is the growth (since the early seventies) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"However, oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, carrying trays of aged rakfisk, a woman with long blond hair and strikingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are such a people - as you call it - reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English very well.
We don't like to show up, we're not braggadocio.
Norway is very careful with its oil - most of the oil and gas industry's revenues are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was littered with money they didn't have, Norway thrixed all the costs.
"As long as you can ski in winter and go hiking in the summer, that's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's rakfisk," she adds with a light-hearted laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food - rakfiska has had enough of me.
Here's a hamburger with elk meat - it's certainly exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we will find even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
My hotel hosts a special dinner dedicated to rakfisk, during which visitors vote to determine the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
There is a live TV broadcast, which shows the presenter in a bow tie, surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jurgen, what is the grade you have put for the best fish there in your mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls from a chair, possibly by going through an aquavit.
Or maybe just inhaling the smell of this fish.
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start to his career.
As Mexico's newly elected President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
Traffic in Mexico City is now in a particularly poor state.
The city is overloaded with traffic at the best of times, and since Monday steel barriers have been erected, cutting several key highways to the capital and causing traffic chaos.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will wear a presidential bandage and take the reins of government.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderon, which is now resigning, but the country is mired in a war on drugs that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government is declaring to the people of Mexico its willingness to fight violence," Mr. Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House earlier this week.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Pena Nieto's political career had developed as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
Straight man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents credit him with the revival of tourism, the development of the resort sector and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Pena Nieto, which are strikingly different from the roads with potholes and pits that were previously on this site.
The plaques with his name hang on the modern building of the sports center and at the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are pinning our hopes on real and serious change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman from the Pena Nieto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that our country so desperately needs, particularly in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high hopes for Enrique Pena Nieto.
In addition, he refutes the accusations of incontinence made by the new president opposition.
He is very direct and very dedicated to the realization of his vision of the future of the country.
He is an excellent statesman, and, above all, a man who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualcoyot, also known as Ciudad Neza, is a stark contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under the overpasses of highways, it is in many senses a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe in the metropolis.
Earlier this year, troops were deployed to subdue drug gangs in those areas; and violence against women is particularly acute here.
Dozens of bodies of murdered women have been found in a vacant lot near a vast landfill in the past two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during the governorship of Mr. Pena Nieto, far exceeding that figure in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, whose name has become a household name when it comes to killing innocent women.
According to mr. Pena Nieto's opponents, it is at best that during his tenure as governor he has failed to deal with the problem of killing women.
At worst, his administration has been accused of ignoring the problem completely.
A resident of a concrete house similar to most of the houses in this dilapidated area, Irina Buendia can hardly hold back tears, showing me pictures of his late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of Mariana in 2010 committed suicide.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her partner.
"When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed before," Ms. Buendia recalled.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and her body was already covered.
Mariana's mother retells this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to the crucifix, which is written only one word: justice.
That, they said, was denied to the family.
"State officials treated me like an old gossip girl, a disgruntled troublemaker.
They want people to just take into their faith everything they say and keep quiet.
But it's wrong, it's not right, especially when there are so many violations and flaws around," she says.
Wearing a presidential dressing on Saturday, President Pena Nieto will take on the hard responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime, and the new President has promised to make tackling the problem a priority during his reign.
"I hope he will be exactly the same president as the governor," said Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nesa are most feared for.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, the prosecution said.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's claims of poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, increased attention was paid to Manning's stay in the military prison in quantico, Virginia.
The defense is demanding that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning's conditions were harsh.
A U.S. army private is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of leaking classified material in U.S. history, had failed to take advantage of multiple opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said he had been transferred while in a military prison.
During cross-examination at a pretrial hearing in Fort Meade, Md., Military Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that records of Manning's weekly visits to the prison administration during his nine months in quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, as part of the defense's motion to dismiss Manning's case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in themselves sufficient punishment, was conducted the day after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide while in custody.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was subsequently published online on The WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During Friday's hearing, Prosecutor Fein and Manning reviewed reports that were filled out after Manning's visits to the administration during his time in the cuantico prison, where he was held on a maximum-security detention facility from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Fein asked friday about the reports, Manning acknowledged that he views the treatment by the prison administration as "excellent" and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized."
The reports did not contain complaints of ill-treatment, even though Manning was directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed verbal concern about these issues and that his administration officials had discussed these issues with him and said they would deal with them but did not record them in writing.
"They were recording "no problems" (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't bring it up in the conversation," Manning said.
The military judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his mistreatment in January 2011 during a commission hearing examining suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing months earlier.
Manning said that during that meeting, he wanted to get the "injury prevention" regime removed from him and relaxed the conditions of his sentence.
The military leadership explained that a limited detention regime - a level lower than the suicide prevention surveillance regime - had been introduced to protect the prisoner as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm ok to have them cancel the injury prevention regime... to make my life better from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a prison at the naval base in quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had suicidal thoughts in Kuwait and that he had once lost consciousness because of the intense heat.
He explained that psychologically it is very difficult when you are not allowed to know how your fate is decided and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world has shrunk to Camp Arifjan base, to the size of my prison," Manning said Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in this cage."
While in quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day - all alone.
Manning says he was only allowed to leave a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move because sleeping or even just lying in the daytime was forbidden by the rules.
According to Manning, while sleeping in his eyes he was constantly struck by the light penetrating outside the camera.
If the guards didn't see his face when he was in bed at night, he said, he was woken up and forced to roll over on his back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal objection to Manning's mistreatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
Also on Friday, a judge asked Manning about a statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that after he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates during a morning checkup.
Manning said he was unable to cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
Responding to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he had to throw a blanket that he could cover for, but acknowledged that no one directly ordered him to leave.
On Thursday, Manning said he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer he could have used a rubber band of underpants or flip-flops to injure himself, but did not.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were taken from the cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he went through during his incarceration and significantly reduce his sentence if Manning is found guilty by a military court, which is due to begin hearing his case early next year.
The defense said it plans to ask Manning to plead guilty to lesser offenses, while challenging other charges as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon alleges that Manning was held in quantico under rules governing the detention of detainees with the strictest possible regime.
Charges against Manning include aiding and abetting an adversary, illegally facilitating the release of data online, passing on national defense information, and stealing government property or documents.
If convicted on all counts, he could face life in prison.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that American-born Mexicans are torn between two cultures.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the hallway for arrivals, approached the border control zone and froze on the spot.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called a Mexican all my life.
It's just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York consider themselves Italian.
Later I settled on the complex design of "American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex structures.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of native speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I got my American passport and stood in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were the usual issues for the meetings of the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Pena Nieto was eager to talk about the recovery of the Mexican economy, which would allow Mexicans to remain in Mexico with the same success, rather than move to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Pena Nieto has vowed to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals have been made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and resentful question.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of its territory at gunpoint.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is necessary only any statesman of the United States to speak at least a word of criticism in the direction of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society immediately there are complaints that the Americans encroach on the sovereignty of neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezum are filled with militancy.
Mexico's relationship with more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States is the most difficult.
Want to talk about grievances?
There are enough of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in this country, and those for whom there are no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican descent have only one reason: at some point in their family history, someone - a father or grandfather - has not been able to realize themselves in Mexico and has been forced to travel north.
Most often they were Mexicans of a certain type - dark, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember it.
In Mexico, it's not seen.
Today our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we studied in good schools and got a good job, but we will not forget that even this dream - American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider its own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer them the same way.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as fake Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We would not be behind the silk curtain now, having found a well-fed life in the United States, but having lost spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and moved legally to the United States as a child, and it reminds me that there are certain tensions between real Mexicans and Mexican-Americans - Mexicans have a clearer understanding of their national identity, and Mexican-Americans are offended.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my fellow Mexican Americans do not feel any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico, we're Americans.
And in the U.S., they call us Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relations are already not complicated enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country this is and how great it is to visit, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
It won't work.
Too many offenses in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us don't think this country is so beautiful.
Sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States, as they did with Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still offended by the way their relatives have been treated in Mexico.
Yes.
I think we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
Ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is long-term peace possible between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futility.
Sounds, become familiar, meaningless arguments about who first started; Many buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; for the first time since the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip landed near the Israeli capital, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly bogged down in their perennial conflict, the Middle East has changed.
This can be treated in different ways, but the events of the Arab Spring have swirled many well-established realities in a storm of rebellion, and Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to stay away from the vortex that has shaken the region.
Perhaps, as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
War without winners
At first glance, the current situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, signed on 21 November, is implemented, this week's clashes have only strengthened the positions of security forces on both sides.
Leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will claim that they forced Israel to retreat despite their losses.
Although some of the group's leaders were killed and 1.7 million residents trapped in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory now controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new powerful and wealthy friends.
The resurgent regional leader Turkey, once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, has come out with the support of Hamas; it was followed by the example of the Richest and Dynamic States of the Gulf.
Rival Hamas supporters claim to have created an Islamist crescent around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by the militant group Hezbollah, to Syria, where increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow Bashar al-Assad's government, and on to Jordan, where the king's rule threatens Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on Israel's southern borders, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood has been strengthened under President Mohamed Morsi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay much attention to supporting Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, is an organization very similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic arrangements, Hamas can become a significant player whose voice will not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, hardliners in Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the rockets launched by Hamas.
Israeli citizens can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the United States has remained true to its unwavering position; many European countries have also laid the blame for the latest round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is Israel's economic prosperity, especially under the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Although some 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip since 2004, Israel has succeeded in minimizing the problem of suicide bombings, partly through the wall that enters the West Bank - a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian State - and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the January 22 elections - has teamed up with even more aggressive conservatives under Avigdor Lieberman's leadership is very comfortable.
What is the point of pandering to the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If they surrender all power in the West Bank, will they not launch missiles towards Israel, as their brethren in the Gaza Strip do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and severely suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
Perhaps hardliners will win; however, their calculations could be refuted by the Arab Spring.
While Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
Israel's defence budget is larger than that of all its Arab neighbours combined.
Waging war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egypt's president, Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on the cease-fire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel must, to say the least, take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic changes in Arab countries onset, the denial of palestinian right to self-determination is a time bomb that will sooner or later explode in Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression was already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbated those problems.
The bloody operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have to be paid for by the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need external momentum
The only solution that sane representatives on both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper, are relentlessly calling for: the formation of two States and Israel's concessions to territories in exchange for security.
The hope, which is not too impressive in the short term, remains to be hoped that the ceasefire will allow other countries to have a more effective influence on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which has long decided to cut off arms shipments to the Gaza Strip, and Turkey and qatar have more than ever taken advantage of the position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than the upcoming UN vote, which could result in recognition of The Virtual Statehood of Palestine.
President Obama also has a role to play in putting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace plan.
Since returning to the White House, he continues to show a reluctance to engage in a solution.
This is a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is only possible in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
A law on unified packaging for cigarettes has come into force in Australia.
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and images of disease-stricken body parts are contrastingly highlighted on dull green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
Australia's first-ever law on the same type of cigarette and tobacco packaging came into force, replacing the logos and colours of different brands with the same box of dull olive colours with eerie images of disease-stricken body parts and images of children whose health was undermined by their parents' smoking.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packs, introduced mandatory from this Saturday - the names of stamps that are printed in the same fine print.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for the registration of tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government says the aim of the measure is to deter young people from smoking by depriving this bad habit of fashion status.
This decision was based on studies showing that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26, in 99 cases out of 100, never become smokers.
"Obviously, even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies try to convey by designing packaging," explains Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that have shown, for example, that the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess in children.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest smokers in the world, so these changes will not have much impact on the profits of multinationals, but other countries are already considering such measures.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market, which will sell cheap and affordable cigarettes.
"This law will have serious consequences that are different from those conceived by its proponents," said Scott McIntyre, representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply many more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha of the small family-owned company zico Import Pty Ltd argues that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone cases that hide unpleasant pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (virtually from scratch) since two months ago companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the High Court of Australia, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, the company has already sold about six thousand products to wholesalers and expects a new batch.
It's a good business for us.
According to experts, the popularity of social networks among the very part of the population targeted by these measures is a potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that made it illegal to advertise cigarettes and support sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from advertising online, but it cannot restrict overseas sites.
"If you're a tobacco dealer and you only have this little loophole left, the idea of promoting your product online will seem very tempting," explains Becky Freeman, who studies public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of trademark reviews written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is it really the work of an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he spared no effort and time and made a video, or is the advertising company behind it?
British American Tobacco's Australian division says the industry is now more busy adapting to the new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry even took measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these States make claims within the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that all these countries' trade relations with Australia are very low.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the government has discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory posting of photos warning of the dangers of smoking.
Now this rule is adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening the laws is being considered in the United Kingdom, New zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia defiantly disobey innovations.
These pictures don't bother me.
I just don't pay attention.
"Just snatch a cigarette and hide the tutu in your pocket," explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a photo of a mouth tumor on a tutu.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Wu, head of the King of the Pack tobacco shop in central Sydney, claims that the same packaging has made it harder to place goods on shelves
"It used to take me an hour to unload a new batch, but now it's four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and ban cigarettes altogether, we would then say: what to do, okay, it's over, close the store," he says, throwing his hands up.
To be bored in the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane that we were waiting for.
So I had plenty of time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight - it's really boring, and there are not much help neither books, magazines, iPhone, or even duty-free shops.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and specialists in children's development are speaking in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations it is not so bad for us and for our children to get bored.
This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may be conducive to creativity.
And since in today's world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we should strive for boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
I used to, like many people, think that boredom is an invention of recent times, when people have more free time.
This is not the case, argues Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary and author of Boredom: A History Lively, Yale University Press, 2011.
"Actually, boredom boasts a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls in Pompeii found Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating back to the first century.
At the same time, the question of how we understand boredom remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying research on the subject and asking a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want but can't do something that would give them satisfaction."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn't do something he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything when Apathy is apathetic.
The main thing about boredom, he says, is "a disturbance of attention and the associated deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is dragging slowly."
According to the description, boredom can seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible link between these states, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel bored when we're really just having trouble concentrating on something.
In her study, "Unoccupied Mind: Determining Boredom from a Spotlight", published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to an earlier experiment, whose participants listened to a recording of a voice reading the journal.
Some participants also heard loud noises of a non-relevant television programme in the next room, others heard the same sounds at low volume, so that they could barely be disassembled, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without a sound track.
Those participants who heard low-volume TV noted that they were bored, more often than others - they found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reason for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, peering into the stream of products on the conveyor belt in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It is believed, he continues, that when people start wiggle on a chair or draw a doodle on a piece of paper, they do so out of boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions just help not to relax physically.
"Research has shown that children who are not forbidden to fidget and twirl, learn better and memorize more information than children who are required to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
At some points we all feel bored: when the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people show varying degrees of inclination to boredom.
In the 1980s, to measure such individual characteristics, researchers developed a special "scale of inclination to boredom."
To determine the assessment on such a scale, questions and statements are used, for example, "A lot of what I have to do is monotonous and monotonous" or "I'm too much interested, so there's no time for anything."
Using these questionnaires, the researchers determined that boys miss girls more often, says Steven Vodanovic, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, "especially when there are a variety of external stimuli.
In general, however, teenagers are often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
It found that 32 per cent of teenagers said they were bored at school and during homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside of school.
At the same time, only 3% of parents said that they are bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what such data would be about boredom now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "adolescence is the peak of boredom", mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: is boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme forms it can, as studies show, encourage people to take absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who has devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; that's boredom," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at New York University.
However, this very brain does not always know what is better to do.
If you get bored and you direct that energy to playing guitar or culinary experiences, you'll make yourself better.
However, if you watch TV, you will feel better only for a while, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child misses and you give him an iPad, he will stop getting bored, but he will not learn to fight boredom on his own or in any other way to manage his time and employment, - says Professor Fenske.
"And these self-regulation skills are used in a variety of situations," he says.
Your child learns not only to occupy himself with something, he also learns self-control in general.
I don't think boredom should be extolled in any way.
However, it is not worth considering it as something bad either.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the uninterrupted flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see it in such a way that we need to experience boredom more often, even though boredom is an extremely unpleasant, unquenchable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
"In today's world, we are used to constant over-stimulation of the senses," he says, "and when silence comes, we get lost and don't know what to do."
It is not yet clear how the new law on marijuana legalization in Colorado will be applied
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old football team player and community college student in southeastern Colorado, is charged with a felony charge of what will soon be perfectly legal throughout the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and the tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orozco says that one day in September he and his friends were in Lamar and were driving a car on the prairie near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was subpoenaed for drug possession and possession of a drug device - minor offenses, each of which was due a $100 fine - and a court date was set.
"We are treated like criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been going on for weeks since the state of Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much on the law as on the place of consideration.
Charges of minor marijuana-related offenses have already been dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped charging people aged 21 and over for possession of small doses, which will become legal as soon as the law comes into force in a couple of weeks.
But in Colorado's more conservative districts, prosecutors have decided to hear existing marijuana cases and continue to prosecute for possession of the drug.
At the same time, some cities, from denver suburbs to the mountainous regions of the West, are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from appearing in their locations.
"It's all so fast that I don't even know what to expect next," Daniel J. says. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington state are also baffled by scratching their heads.
They will have to form rules to determine how to license cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done before December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most other states in settling marijuana use issues, first for medical purposes and now for entertainment.
"Colorado has a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Alcohol Regulatory Council in Washington state.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith, than put forward some proposals and hope that it will work.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can focus on," he says.
The Washington state bill, called I-502, will take effect on December 6 and plunge the state into a state of uncertainty for a year when the state licensing system is not yet available and marijuana ownership has already been legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects to be addressed during this period, such as how to strike a balance between the state's "adequate access" to licensed marijuana, with a ban on its trade 1,000 feet away from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana businesses in cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly formed Marijuana Legalization Center research group.
On 21 November, the Oates Police Chief of Aurora sent an e-mail to his subordinates saying that the city's prosecutor's office would no longer prosecute persons under the age of 21 for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police would stop convicting people of the violations "from now on."
Oates Police Chief said police would monitor the city's compliance with rules governing medical marijuana growers and prosecute illegal drug dealers and distributors.
Weld County's attorney in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, is taking a stricter approach to the issue.
After the vote on the bill, he said that prosecutors would continue to prosecute marijuana possession, mainly to encourage users to take treatment.
At the moment, 119 people have been charged with possession of two or fewer ounces of marijuana, though many of them are charged with other violations.
"It is the responsibility of our agency to prosecute for acts deemed criminal at the time of their commission," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction has been mixed even in places like mesa rural district, where voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, no longer prosecute adults for possession of a small quantity of the drug.
District Attorney Pete Hausinger upheld the decision, but also decided not to withdraw charges in already open cases involving marijuana possession.
"I believe that it is our direct duty to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado residents who voted supported the decision, it would not be easy to incorporate marijuana for entertainment into the state and legal system.
And the conflicting reaction of residents in different parts of the state laid bare the ambiguity of the attitude of local authorities to the state's experiment with marijuana.
"There is a cultural barrier for district attorneys in this matter," explains Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents those convicted of marijuana possession and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've been chasing people for so long that they can't really accept that it's not a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington - the first states to treat a small amount of marijuana the same as alcohol - are destined to become an experimental field nationwide to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Proponents of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of the legalized trade, but at the same time they are cautiously awaiting instructions from federal authorities, who still plan to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
Proponents of marijuana legalization hope the Justice Department will give in to the issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of drug dealers and patients who used marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government has in most cases made the go-ahead for medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Bureau of Drug Enforcement agents are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores that are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations had approved a moratorium on new marijuana stores that would not have been able to open before a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in a position where we're going to license someone, and then it's going to cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a city councilman.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many unresolved issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was survived from Oxford for being a Conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of the antique symposium, laying two foundations of civilization - freethinking and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying at the history department of Worcester College, Oxford University in the late eighties, I packed my bags and left, which turned into the first real scandal of my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from chipped cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was systematically bullied and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I went to private school.
I was bullied for one reason only, and in this glorified cradle of enlightenment it looked like real barbarism and blind bigotry: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the Conservatives.
You may ask, why do we have to think about it now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students, who adhere to the center-right views, are subjected to the same bullying.
This institutionalised and growing hatred of Conservative students at Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as the one afforded to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at Corpus Christi College In Cambridge say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and made to feel like unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the college's equal rights committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only exacerbated by a recent BBC 2 documentary on student politics, "Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right," in which conservatives were portrayed as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cooke, the former president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, who rides a Rolls Royce, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver sledgeham over.
At other universities, conservative students complain that they are being made "scapegoats because of higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Conservatives Association of The University of Nottingham, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing bias towards left-wing views in the university environment.
People who don't even know us think we are the brazen and violent children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi College, where the petition for increased protection was filed, calls the atmosphere "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cherill, 19, the new president of the Conservatives Association at Oxford University, says the student club's attitude toward centre-right voters has deteriorated significantly.
"This is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate and just the normal lives of the club members," she said.
The first few weeks at Oxford I wasn't just in the minority, I was alone.
I got there in September 1986, a timid and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford was feverish with hatred for the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university had stripped former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree by a vote because of budget cuts to higher education.
Even Stalinists would be uncomfortable in such an atmosphere.
In the first days of the freshman week, when students get to know each other and teachers, I felt for the first time what was waiting for me ahead.
I did not know that teachers not only looked past the bullying of conservative students, but also gladly took part in it.
Political issues - the miners' strike, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - penetrated through the wood-panelled walls of the auditoriums.
At my first seminar, I needed to translate the 18th-century French into English, and I wasn't ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was given to me with difficulty, I stammered.
Harry Pitt was a very bilious man with a face that looked like a cake.
"Thatcherists fundamentally don't teach French or do they just have brains?" he asked.
Other students giggled.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take a few initial French lessons in your spare time, unless you are very busy rotating in society," Pitt said.
I went back to my room completely miserable.
That evening in college, I sat alone at lunch; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year English student who introduced himself as a member of the University Conservatives Association.
"I know who you are," he said amiably.
"Unfortunately, this is the case:
anyone suspected of being sympathetic to the Conservatives will be bullied.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be harder for you.
Most of the fresh conservatives pretend to be Labour."
Later, at a local pub, I cowardly tried to be hypocritical.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick didn't work out.
The freshman of the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex? One of them asked.
"They're stabbing each other, aren't they?"
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the prosecution was abolished in the sixties.
Will I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or will I have to meet like-minded people only under the cover of night?
Will I be forced to become a Labour MP and hide my real beliefs?
The next three years began to seem hell to me, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a Conservative, but also for being Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He didn't show up in college.
He despised him for his provincialism, pettiness and commitment to a Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he took up a professorial position at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents' home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased metropolitan friends.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the forties there accepted any political views.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said plaintively.
"They can't do that, but not in the city of dormant spires...
Even my Communist friends have always behaved impeccably."
His wet eyes were clouded.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop my university."
I was exhausted by the constant trips to London and my emotional defence was weakening.
My friend, also a conservative, could not stand the pressure and abandoned his convictions.
The following week, during a seminar, when another history teacher seriously called me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In my heart, burning with shame, I confessed that "my parents brainwashed me" and called them "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin of my oxford career was destined to hammer my father.
At the time, he was writing two columns each week for Rupert Murdoch's publications.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and got on the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a crybaby and a rag.
But at eighteen, no one should be the target of such anger and intimidation in the school.
It is all the sadder that it was Oxford, which not only produced fourteen Tory prime ministers, but to this day hides behind the undeserved reputation of a university that values equality and free-thinking.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the exhibition "Valentino: The Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemitz and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of the English queen Elizabeth I, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of "Valentino: The Master of Sewing," a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "il signora" Garavani, but it could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobility.
The first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, is full of personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a humble tailor from the city of Voguera in northern Italy to the idol of the international "elite".
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with that.
"At least they don't put out the cigarette butts of your gorgeous carpet, like some great pop stars do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemica.
In the 60s and 70s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unparalleled host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved coming to his chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And despite this, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza remembers a charismatic fashion designer.
One day we went to dinner at his house, it was after a fashion show in the Plaza de La Liga in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy Jr.
Valentino's style was evident in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in its decoration, in food, in music.
"Valentino made each of the guests feel important and loved," recalls the "top model" whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during Paris Fashion Week.
"He never goes out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art," she concludes.
Pedigree Parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of falling in love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been turned into a glamorous catwalk sixty meters long, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and has to defile on the catwalk, contemplating the "viewers" of dreams who sparkle masterpieces from Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that Monica used in "The Nights" which belonged to Empress Fara Diba.
In this public, such names as Sybil of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg shine from the models.
Nati Abascal and fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino - as the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember him beautifully.
These were pants, a shirt, a vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," said Nati Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I love the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they "fit" his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion legislator Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she's dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed that I would have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally came that hour in the late 90s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear it for a holiday at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with ruffles, a "corsage" in the crease and a strapless neckline.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her festive dresses from the fashion designer with "maximum care... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories accompanying it."
"King" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House - Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the fashion designer calls his seamstress) to make this outfit of ivory silk with inlaid pearls, twelve kinds of different laces and a train of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is a high fashion mark of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from the highest light."
Intoxicated for many years by the "lifestyle" of the elite, now Valentino himself is its best representative.
Cavalier of the Grand Cross (the mark of distinction of the highest rank in Italy), The Cavalier of Labor, Commander of the Order of Arts and Literature, awarded the Legion of Honour, Garavani collected as many honors as any of his clients' spouses.
"I always had his finesse, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance," D'Arenberg recalls.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museo d'Ors.
He was sitting at a table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
"He was immaculate, time did not exist for him."
If the princess says it...
The hardest profession in the world: miners from Kawah-Ijen
For four euros Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of the volcano on steep rocky trails
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who make a living mining for sulphur in the Kawah Ijen volcano on the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphurous gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes in contact with the air.
Chipping huge chunks of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, puts baskets on his shoulders and carries them up on a steep rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, the height of which is 2,386 meters, only 250 meters, but the exhausted loaders need more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle step, with difficulty keeping balance and carefully groping the way, so as not to stumble and fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong move could cost them their lives, as happened to a tourist from France who fell off the cliffs of Kawah-Ijen a few years ago.
Miners from Kawah-Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur they produce
Once at the top, they make their way between tourists who take pictures of them, as if they were monkeys from the circus and, wearily carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales, which the mining company placed a little higher, at an altitude of 1.850 meters.
We are talking about PT Kandi Ngrimbi, a company that has operated this volcano since 1960 and, better and not to say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemicals, because it is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"Since the norm is carrying 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each walk," antho, who usually carries three daily shifts, explains to us.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
While it seems like a miser for such a non-human effort, it's three times what he'd earn in the field.
"The fee for miners is very high by local standards, where coffee fees are paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the loader, who used to work as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason, which in Indonesia is as crushing as the sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where only Hindus, and brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly, and his eyes water because of toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawah Igen, whose sulfur had already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs, and his eyes get water because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this nice and intelligent young man might be a tour guide, waiter or porter at the hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the sulfur does not cease to flow out at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, illuminating his way with a small lantern connected to his helmet, which he himself bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carry baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur production to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work on their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they don't even get a portion of the 30,000 rupee (2.5 euro) photography fee, which, along with the entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this reserve charge tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its mules.
"This work is for cattle, not for people," says Badrusin, a stocky porter for 42 years who has spent three decades on Kawah-Ijen since he left college.
Able to lift up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will tolerate work "as much as he can" because he needs money for the education of his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm going to die here, because a volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur burns the throat and burns the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains of their severe diseases ... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, knee pain and sores on the shoulders, which deformed under the weight of baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can now only lift 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day he and his comrades carry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to a warehouse in Tamansari, covering a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the thickets.
"I'm not retiring, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unaynik says, opening his mouth wide, which lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30, also works as a sulfur vector.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest things in the world: what human mules from Kawah-Ijen do.
Singapore seeks children to save economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress and house prices and education on the absence of children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I am a patriot husband, you are my wife a patriot, we will fulfill our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the mint tortilla advert, but despite this - or perhaps because of it - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Let's put bao (bulka) in the oven" to make fun of The Birth Rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, cherishes the hope that with the help of advertising they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining form.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill "their national duty."
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world for reproduction of our own kind, so we felt that this is a topic that we should address.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, such as launching spirits with pheromones or organizing fast dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely to compose a rap?
1.2 children
Who does not take it so lightly is the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The state package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax credits.
But all this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservatism and strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its National Population Authority, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - which is known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tang Wei Ming, director of policy for couples and families at the National Population Administration, said the reason was "improved education" and a "broader range of career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities other than weddings and family building," she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of bachelors and to the postponement of marriages and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policies, which aim to dramatically increase immigration to counter population declines, are causing outrage among local people.
There are websites in Singapore that thrive on the barely concealed xenophobia of many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who have been criticized for keeping wages low and not being integrated.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that Singapore's ruling party won the worst election result since independence last year.
After the election there was an attempt to solve the problem, with quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in fertility is having a known impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, medical spending and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts not to build so many small housing.
For example, this has started to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Guide has moved to monitor the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These 46-square-metre apartments sell very well.
However, there is a view that they can contribute to a single lifestyle and deprive the incentive of developers who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of housebuilding firm EL Developers, says their "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than more spacious specimens.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold out for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash flow is increasing.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers who used to be put on the hurdle if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too overstretched
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the center's financial quarter, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"People are very overstretched, housing is expensive, as is education, and because of this a lot of people put it off," says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man, 20.
Men and women cite their careers, stress and house prices and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how hard the Government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, in terms of procreation, Singaporeans have the final say.
Personal offline - personal online
confidentiality.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish Dictionary, it is a private or "private area that has the right to protect against any interference."
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when discussing things on the Internet that he probably wouldn't share outside the Internet?
elPeri'dico interviewed five children from ten to 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine," in personal terms, and "password and username" when applied to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't have uploaded to the post," says ten-year-old Jorge, as he tries to explain the personal value on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he says.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I also have fun with my friends.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who's behaving stupidly," he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish indecent photos of nudity, crimes or write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know 35 friends he has at FB and nine of his Twitter followers.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother knows she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just download them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
Without hesitation, he replies that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't take into account someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teen has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter admits that he does not know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one rubbed into his trust and did not ask for his home address or phone number.
"If I'm being pressured or asked, I'll just delete them from my account," he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is now known as cyber mobbing.
One friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted money.
"He never found out who it was," he assures.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
"Only included privacy."
He then explains the sequence of steps to set your account up safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do it if I don't like the person or if I want to.
"Although I know it's cyber mobbing," he confirms.
Key questions
Marilos Porras, an English teacher and specialist in education and learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, you need to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites the rules of the game have changed," she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prenski, a master of pedagogy at Yale University and author of The Digital Aboriginal and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines are them, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are still learning," she says.
He explains that the topic is complex "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken, at an age when maturity is not sufficient to do so."
"Also, to be selective, while the most important thing for them to be popular is to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what privacy is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it online?
Or would you like to post a picture of you like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you sign photos from parties, do you ask other people for permission to celebrate them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they should behave online the same way they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"Outside the Internet, people behave with respect, responsibility and other principles, so should be on social networks," she says.
vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university lecturer, primary education professor and education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social media policies in good faith.
Understanding each of the items, they have good reason to talk to children about the premise of opening an account online.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published," he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key question is reminding children of the lesson "don't talk to strangers."
UNASUR summit ends without the announcement of the Lima Declaration
The 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and theoretically signed by seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly attempted to gain access to a document signed at the 6th meeting of UNASUR heads of state and government, but sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration indicated on the front page that it would be handed over after the closure, but then confirmed that it would be published on the Peruvian government's website at some point.
When asked about the text, they indicated that the contents had been provided by the President of Peru, Rillanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the Summit was limited all the time.
During the day it was only broadcast, in the press room, a video of the presidential assembly without a sound with the message "closed meeting, sound is forbidden".
A small number of information circulating among reporters was passed on by the press secretary of some UNASUR governments who attended the meeting, but not the Peruvian one.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of participating presidents, which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Administration of the President of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was a statement by Humala, not an official document that concluded the summit.
Peru hosted the III Summit of the South American and Arab Countries (ASPA) last October, and the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was not circulated at that time, despite the insistent demand of the press.
On the official ASPA website, you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that transmission systems for all journalists were provided, but they limited the receipt of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to accept the verdict of the Hague Court, which would settle a territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Olyanta Humala, and Chile's Sebastian Piniera, gathered for a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins hearing statements by both sides in The Hague on Monday, as part of the accusation that Lima has brought against Santiago.
"We will abide by and implement a decision that will clarify the differences that we are currently presenting to this international court," Umala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of differences, pacts and international tribunals," Piniera added, and greeted with a handshake between Umala and the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they will submit to the International Court of Justice came just after Colombia challenged this week's Bogota Pact, under which it accepted submission to the verdicts of that international court following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it deemed erroneous.
The summit took place in the absence of the president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina' Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former president, Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The host president, Illanta Humala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, just after noon Lima time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he said that 16 agreements were adopted and directions for 31 projects among South American countries were approved, the amount of the proposed investment amounted to 17 billion dollars.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries would take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding residency agreements".
He said that action was being taken to improve "cooperation against citizens' insecurity and against organized transnational crime, action to increase the availability of medicines, low-cost Internet access in all corners of South America and taking into account the cumulative and effective risks of natural disasters".
Since Europe is in crisis, "economic unification (Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our production framework and foresee a better future for our cities," Umala added.
"We decided to give privileges to a group of 31 iconic projects that will improve the connectivity of South America' spaces, especially in the rural and border areas... uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes," the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five belonged to Peru and were limited to cross-linkings to its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and the two aimed at a greater link with Ecuador, but he did not provide further details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve as its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united and to have good relations between its neighbours, was another topic highlighted at the summit.
In that sense, Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos, said before entering a regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City for respectful talks on the maritime dispute in the wake of the verdict of the international court challenged by Bogota.
"The day after tomorrow (Saturday), I may meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will revise all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will cope with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they have a presence at the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto.
Also during the summit, the bloc's defense ministers met tentatively to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimity on the issue of protecting the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the latter's participation is suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, reiterated today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who attended the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peruvian state television that the Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and in other clashes, "but now they are almost the same fatherland."
He defended, in this context, the south American citizenship project, which was endorsed by UNASUR member countries.
"We need to achieve free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back in time," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President has also shown himself to be a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the pretext of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who signed the San Jose Human Rights Pact.
Those who lecture never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and funded by the United States," he said, alluding to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles with him, but respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that at one time "there was some suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be respected."
He also criticized the Swedish justice for demanding that he come to his territory for questioning about an alleged sex crime, while "the Swedish law itself considers it possible to carry it out by video conference, which could be made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of deterioration in Assange's physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
What really is is the danger of his physical and mental health deteriorating due to being imprisoned in a small space without being able to do exercises in the air.
"It affects the health of anyone," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through a guarantee of immunity that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stressed that there were talks in London to find a solution to the WikiLeaks founder's imprisonment.
We are not negotiating human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, conducts a number of trials in various European courts," he said.
And he said that "if the UK provides a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation allows it perfectly and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogates him over Skype, that problem will be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as an advocate of press freedom and stressed that he does not tolerate "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort freedom of expression."
"The main enemies of press freedom are not corrupt villains-politicians, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect, he was pleased that neither these journalists, "neither bankers nor bourgeois hegemons dominate Ecuador" and added that, having been re-elected, "the revolution will deepen the development in the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the guise of the rule of law" because in reality "it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian President also found it "perfectly reasonable" for his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to now negotiate maritime borders with Nicaragua following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which had proved to be in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not being respected.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by a desire to go together.
We need to process them together to overcome them and keep moving forward.
He also expressed the hope that the dispute over maritime borders, which is being waged in the same court of Peru and Chile, would be a good end to, and that it was "right for Latin America to appeal to international authorities if the two countries commit to a decision, however difficult it may be".
Regarding the possibility of running as a candidate in Ecuador's upcoming presidential election to run for a third consecutive term, he said he viewed the possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he loses the elections in February 2013, he will leave public life.
On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in such unjust situations as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
If we won, that would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"It's a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I have just spoken to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he has gone for a treatment that has already been scheduled, routine, and that he is expected to skip the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean that President Chavez's health is deteriorating," he explained.
The Head of the Ecuadorian State took part today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS test had tested positive.
"It was like I was stunned," he recalls the moment, despite the doctor's tact.
The young man hid it from his family.
Deciding to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And his efforts were justified - he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" patients in the HIV department of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he was admitted in 1994, having overcome many obstacles.
He has been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 1990s it would have been hard to believe - there were too few treatment options, too little knew about the disease, too biased against the sick.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, in those days to have AIDS was a sentence.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and do it without impairing the quality of life.
However, without knowing about their disease, still many people come when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the advent of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "the great achievement at the moment is that the survival of the patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of HCG's HIV department, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, citing the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
An infectious disease specialist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of immune system damage available to patients at the beginning of diagnosis, with better life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years when reported 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above means that those who are diagnosed with HIV-positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since the advent of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths had already been reported by May of this year; however, it is claimed that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still fatalities?
- Personally, I think that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's the way it is in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years we have had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late because they do not know about their infected condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He cited devastating figures: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some kind of opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore samples must be provided for detection on a massive scale, for all the people who ask for it."
In his proposal, experts and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco (COESIDA) agree, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who applied for a check-up at a private laboratory, prompted only by the fact that his friend did it and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposha sarcoma, a cancerous tumor which is one of the common complications.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know.
"If I die anyway, I'd rather get drunk three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercises, take medication.
To date, his parents only know that he has suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of occupations, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but with mutual responsibility, I care about myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, to encourage those who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, feeling fear.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This message summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a great gap between health programmes and ordinary citizens, according to Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has tackled HIV-related issues.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "there was actually an increase in the distribution of condoms, we used to be given one or two, now we are given packages of one hundred, and that's very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you need them?" is a popular question, with echidna and condemnation, from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and health care workers who don't want to hear teenagers, the propagandist assured.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms should not only be behind the counters and that a hundred of them should be in vending machines in public toilets in places frequented by young people.
This is not an encouragement of promiscuity.
It's not about paying for beer and a motel, Gov. Emilio Gonzalez said when asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Jalisco
There were 13,435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections refer to the sexual pathway, 6% through the blood and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know about it for one reported case.
Given the ratification by the United States Court of Appeals of a decision that would revoke the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a fatal precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country that has solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of firms, which are allowed by Mexican laws, are not valid in the country of bands and stars, in contravening international agreements.
In practical terms, the june 15 decision by Judge Harleen Hale in the Bankruptcy Court of the Northern District of Texas leaves defenseless Mexican firms facing the possibility of arrest on their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door for Mexico's leading glass manufacturer to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies.
As an entry, while the court judge notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says the primary proceedings relate to competitive proceedings in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the annulment of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, the UN Model Law on the Unification of the Law of International Trade was created for this purpose, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbiter.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without an intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of competitive debt production that vitro subsidiaries had before the parent company, there would not have been a majority needed to approve the restructuring.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Productions.
It is also true that subtracting the votes of the affiliates, one way or another the creditors of Vitro, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely funds "vultures" like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 percent to 37.
The Court of Appeal omits this data.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, which has been affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States has overtaken by its attacks on the country.
For now, the Gonzalez Sada family will appeal the decision to the appeals court itself to allow the vote to reach its plenum, that is, five judges, because only three voted.
In the case of failure, an application for a certificate will be filed, which will require a review of the process by the highest court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government as an amicus curiae ("friend of the court") that described the process that Vitro follows under the Competitive Proceedings Act, signaling that it exempts itself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it to Section 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, rules established for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Cannon from two boards: they beat in Vitro and beat in the country.
Total balance
Given the months-long complaints placed on the table by The Mexicana de Aviaci'n unions against the company's former owner, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Union Association of Aviator Pilots has already discovered the bottleneck.
The agency, headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino, has just submitted a criminal claim against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory body systematically refused to submit reports to the Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic regarding the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the F/589 trust fund of IXE Bank, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be used to buy shares in the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Ascarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Surround Dragon Mart
Gathering over the weekend for a forum at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of the general civil society approved the creation of a broad front to counter the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We're talking, as you know, of a giant hub for the sale and distribution to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for employees of 150 companies.
Earlier, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the southeast zone to confront the monumental forces, which leveled off part of the protected areas and put serious threats against the industry.
Death acta
Referring to the Government's rejected senate requirement to explain under what conditions and circumstances Mexico's ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as the acronym in English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already been archived.
As you know, the action was carried out, despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of treating it as infringing freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long run

Hector "Gethin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Avid basketball traveler Hector "Gethin" Reyes was more than 60 years associated with this sport and, thanks to him, traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Gethin" Reyes.
And after all, before a brain haemorrhage chained him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a small-league player, major basketball player, authorized and head of BSN with the Bayamon Cowboys and president of the Basketball Federation.
"I've played many basketball roles throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of BSN, general manager of the National Team and president of the federation in the 90s," Reyes recalled during Primera Hora's visit to his home in Bayamon, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating by making this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected over his long journey, bear witness to this.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotion he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, starting from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old as a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships that took place from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Minsi made his BSN debut.
From that moment on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, was in charge," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartov, who was on his way here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7."
"Do you want to?"
And that was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended the sniper Raymond Gauss, who got citizenship and became one of our top scorers.
I remember saying that if Minsey had won the championship for Bayamona, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboys championship with Gauss, but from a distance, because by 1988 I was already the head of the federation.
By that time I preferred to enjoy his achievements and Minsi's achievements in the national team.
I remember winning for the first time against the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and it was going to be bronze, were it not for the Canadian referee who made us replay the final game," Reyes said.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one that won against Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and defeated the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze at the World Championships.
Not only did Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and Piculina (Ortiz) play again, but also the young (Javier) 'Tonito' Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihote' Morales, who was unable to participate in 90 due to a knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic qualifying tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role-playing players like 'Canito' Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hurruitner in place of players suspended for the mess at the Pan American Championships Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level the way Piculin did.
And that's without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
This is a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s in BSN there were up to 17 teams per season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to implement, like regionalizing smaller categories.
For example, to the boys from Ponce to play only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys travel and play too much, and it's unnecessary.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born september 21, 1931, in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon-predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of "Dallas," died Friday night due to complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas-based studio.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he liked the most," his family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving fair.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her spokesman Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted to drinking for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Long before "Dallas," Hagman gained notoriety on television for his role as a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive genie girl, played by Barbara Eden, and begins to live with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his mastery interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the pinnacle of fame.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its entourage aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?", conceived to create a hype around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, has spawned international discussions and millions of dollars that were risked in bookmakers.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at that time.
When the response was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned "Dallas" into the second-highest-view entertainment program in history, after the 1983 finale of "MASH" attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. prevented her and then threatened her that he would accuse her of prostitution if she did not get out of town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: a dishonest businessman and an unfaithful husband who wanted his wife an alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be placed for treatment.
"I know what should be on the J.R. gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It must be said: "Here rests an honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Principe, also the heroine of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, both on and off screen."
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us who is fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new "Dallas" episode were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT.
The recording of five episodes of the second season was already finished and the sixth was in production, the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have not yet announced what will happen to the series after Hagman's departure.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shined in such classic works as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he gave birth in 1931 during his marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the new York theater stages in the early 1950s and then served in the Rafe of England from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met the young Swedish artist Mai Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoir ,Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales About My Life."
"I didn't include anything that I thought could hurt or affect someone in any way," he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began advocating organ donation and volunteered at the hospital to help patients in fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go to surgery and after," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some solace, like "don't be afraid, be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He has also been an outspoken campaigner against smoking and has participated in several campaigns.
A course that explores the "End of the World" begins
Each week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
This semester, when professor of religion Stuart Sharme decided to read a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible lure: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar, December 21, which many people seized on as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what was expected in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call "long-editing", and the growing conflict that Israel is embroiled in, a place where Christian theorists of late times believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharme told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you analyze what's happening in the world now, as if we only have 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic way of thinking.
And he's not the only professor to offer "end-of-world" courses this semester, theoretically the last one in history.
At Temple University, Associate Professor Barry Wacker is reading the "Media, Culture and the End of the World" course.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way hypothetical scenarios suggest that certain human actions are offered.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell the students what might be plausible and impossible," Walker said.
On the main campus of The University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to read a course called simply "The End of the World."
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again in case the end of the world doesn't come," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent destruction," students must study, prepare projects and pass final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work "until the very night in which the end of the world is supposed to come," Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
"Places ended in two hours," Restall said of his high-scoring student course, which enrolled 35 students.
We received e-mails for many weeks before the semester from people who asked if there were still places.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in the Department of Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or lack thereof.
Will Vekes, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course to teach that," he said.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed - let alone the professor - said they believed in the end of the world date on December 21.
"Our first project involved the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Seglen, a 21-year-old final-year student at Temple University in West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; It's just a key moment in the calendar," Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that dates back several centuries, where people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"Other places people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, was quick to respond to a question about whether he knew of any course about the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, alluding to a higher court order.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the last trial had been talked about for a long time, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are careless about this date.
Some said they were going to end-of-world parties.
"Maybe I'll call one of my friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
