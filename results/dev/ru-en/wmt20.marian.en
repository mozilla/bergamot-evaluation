This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Chancellery of the State Council of the People's Republic of China for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.

TikTok hides undesirable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which - under 18 years of age
Imagine China / Reuters
The Guardian says that the Chinese social network TikTok censored with videos mentioning Tiananmen Square, Tibet's independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong.
The documents found in the publication say that the owner of TikTok (company ByteDance) with the help of the application promotes the foreign policy of China abroad.
The major part of the violations relating to China's policy falls under "incitement to hatred."
In each case, TikTok places undesirable publications in a context that is appropriate to general rules so that the actions of the social network do not look censored.
For example, the ban on criticism of the socialist system of China falls under the general ban "criticism or attacks on politics and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc."
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under "digestion of the history of China or other countries."
The document also lists the list of banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or statesmen," including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, American presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Pak Kain, President of Indonesia Jodno and President of Indonesia.
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.
Publications from the first category are removed by social network administrators and may result in blocking the user.
Not too severe violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: "Now we use a localized approach for moderation, as well as attract independent local specialists."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the "Producer Center."
"Producer Center" is one of Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Producer Center" coordinates with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be placed without agreement, Bogdanov reports.
When asked whether TikTok can speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov responds affirmatively and says he has seen such publications.
Our Didgital founder Roman Zaripov agrees with Bogdanov: "The main rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: it is impossible to post shocking content, discriminating statements and so on."
But under these rules you can sum up any content that does not like moderators, notes Zaripov.
Zaripov's agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which - under 18 years.
According to the user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
Social network administrators check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: neuronet analyzes the faces and determines how many years a person looks, says Bogdanov.
If the neuronet decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork co-working.

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The theme of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
Of the most famous - pine pollen.

It is time to establish interregional relations
The Committee of the Federation Council for Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions about the existing programs of business development and the legalization of self-employed, as well as the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve the current legislation.
"To date, communication between the regions is insufficiently established, as a result of which the entrepreneurial community in all regions of the senators was outlined the question of the lack of information about regional programs of development of entrepreneurship in the whole country," said Andrey Kutepov.
In the appendix to the letter sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments in the regions for the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and problems (it is available to the editorial office).
In addition to relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions are also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.

And in some other regions special measures are taken to support youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to be removed from the shadows
According to the regional authorities, a number of changes in the current legislation should be made to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity," since this "is the most consistent with the content of the state service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens."
In the Ivanovo region it is necessary to make amendments that provide for the expansion of the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for the finishing and repair of residential premises, summer houses, physical training.
The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous producers of dairy products with the help of the veterinary system "Mercury."
And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions advocate for consolidation in the legal field of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and directions of support of social entrepreneurship.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills," assured Andrey Kutepov.

At the same time, the value of imported products declined to $226.5mn from $4bn 975.5mn respectively.
We are talking about the supply of goods that did not fall under the embargo.
According to the report, the volume of prohibited products was compensated by increasing imports from imports from the CIS, Africa, Southeast Asia, Serbia.
Recall that in late August, the government prolonged until December 31, 2020 the validity of the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited for import into Russia in the framework of countersanctions.
The document, posted on the official portal of legal information, noted that the validity of the rules for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the decision to destroy the sanctions was applied to products from the USA, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine joined this list.
The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of the illegally imported "sanctions" (products caught under the food embargo, which Moscow introduced in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government allowed to destroy "sanctions" food in any legal way.
As the sanctions of the West remain, Russia has also prolonged its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, the products that citizens import for personal use, this measure does not apply.
The ban does not apply to the importation of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, Mikhail Fedotov, head of the Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, described the destruction of food as "just immoral" as "just immoral", and this, according to him, negatively affects the education of people.
Moreover, Rospotrebnadzor launched an initiative to ban the destruction of food suitable for use in early June.
After that, a similar recommendation was given to the government by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.
Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that it is wrong to destroy food, and we need to think how to use them for their appointment, assessing the quality.

In Chile began to build a telescope worth 1 billion euros
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, this week officially began the construction of the dome of the building, where the telescope E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope - "European ultra-large telescope"), while the most expensive and ambitious ground astronomical project will be located.
Its total value, according to ESO estimates, will exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope - its record large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments of 1.4 meters.
This is a huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflective surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters will help E-ELT get the first detailed photos of planets outside the Solar System, stars in other galaxies, as well as look for doubles of the Earth.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory for observation of the surroundings Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
