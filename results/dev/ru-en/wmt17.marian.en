Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
The international group of biologists concluded that the longest-lived vertebrates are the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, reports RT.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the eye lens of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest kurk, whose length exceeds five meters, can be from 272 to 512 years.
Biologists believe that a low metabolism plays an important role in the longevity of sharks, which leads to slow development.
Females of Greenland sharks reach puberty only by 150 years.
Earlier it was believed that the longest vertebrates live "neighbor" sharks - the Greenland hood.
The oldest individual, known to the scientist, was a little older than 210 years.

Is it worth going to the sanatorium, if there is no health problems?
Our expert is the chief physician of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, is it worth him to go to the sanatorium?
Sanatorium-resort rest is necessary not only for the treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In the conditions of the sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his body and get the doctor's recommendations, how to live, so that his health is not destroyed.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" - this is an important signal of the body, it should not be waved.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is experienced by about 90% of visitors.
And he is most prone to people from large cities aged 45 to 55 years.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and give yourself a rest in time.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to spend a vacation with children, you don't have to part with them.
For children, even the smallest, there are health programs, which include both diagnostic services, pediatrician consultations, tests, and therapeutic.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalations, a special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, therapeutic physical training.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor taking into account the individual indications and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, the sanatoriums usually operates a children's club with animators, where children can attend game classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with babies, provide the baby with the necessary conditions and provide services of an experienced babysitter.
A soft winter, a long summer, an abundance of sunny days a year (over 300) create good conditions for a year-round holiday in the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are held indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium-resort treatment is desirable to carry out 2 times a year, especially for people of mature age.
The main chip of the region of the Caucasian Mineral Waters, of course, therapeutic mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and affects the different systems of the body.
The water differs in temperature, the amount of salts, the total mineralization, the chemical and gas composition.
The doctor picks up water depending on the patient's health.
Thus, Narzan has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating action, restores the function of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
Essentuki 4 acts on the gastrointestinal tract, reduces the level of sugar.
"Essentuki new" has anti-inflammatory, choleretic and diuretic action.
The same effects have the water "Slavyanovskaya."
When assigning water, the doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it selects less salt water, because salts are delayed by the liquid, which leads to increased pressure.
Acceptance of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and specific temperature.
Now in the sanatoriums are available and various cosmetological procedures for the face and body.
What types of recovery, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained in the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake Tambukan, slury dirt from which is useful for joints, spine, internal organs.
It has anti-inflammatory, absorbing, immunomodulatorifying effect.
This is a wellness walk on individually drawn up routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Resort Park (the second in size in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in close proximity to the mineral spring "Narzan."
There you can also take wine, pearl, iodobral, selenium, sage-lakry, depending on what you will appoint a doctor.
We extend the fruiting.
What to do to the harvest went until the end of the season?
Tells Yulia Belopyova, agronomist and summer cottage.
High tomatoes it is time to arrange a haircut: remove new stepsons, cut the tops, remove all the leaves to the penultimate cluster with fruits and inflorescences with small rivets - will not have time to ripen.
All tomatoes, regardless of the "constitution," as well as peppers and eggplants, feed the zoleno-superphosphate extract, treat biopreparations (Accomp to the experiment - to accelerate the pouring and growth of fruits, Phytosporin-M, Phitolavin, Hamair, Batofit - from diseases, Immunociofith - to increase immunity, Fiops.
From chemicals at the end of summer should be used only copper coloros, colloidal sulfur and green soap.
We make the last watering of plants.
Long-legged cucumbers in the greenhouse lower from the sleep so that the lower, the head, detrusive part of the stem (25-40 cm) lay on the ground, watered with warm water and a solution of the Circron, sprinkle the stem 5-7 cm compost.
It is also easy to extend the fetus: cut the old leaves, pour with warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, sprinkle the fertile ground under the bush.
To protect against night colds, install above the arc bed with cover material.
During the day, keep the plants open, and after sunset close.
Signs of the end.
What does Russia point to the crisis?
Economists saw signs of Russia's withdrawal from the longest recession in the last twenty years.
According to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, GDP of the Russian Federation shows positive dynamics - in the second quarter GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This indicator is minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest Rosstat data, the decline in the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed down to 0.6%.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development also announced the stabilization of the situation recently.
Ahead - a slow growth.
According to experts of the CBR, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
"The index estimate of the Russian GDP indicates that the recession remained behind, and ahead - a slow growth of the economy," the Bank of Russia says in the bulletin "What Trends Say."
The regulator's modular GDP estimate for the current quarter increased to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter GDP decline stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter seasonally refined GDP decline amounted to 0.2% QoQ.
But during the quarter the decline stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June the GDP change was within 0-0.15," the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development of RIA Novosti quotes.
The slowdown in the Russian economy's decline over the past five quarters shows that "the day has been over."
Among other tokens pointing to signs of revival of the national economy, Bloomberg calls the growth of demand for electricity and rail transportation, the revival of the business.
If you make an amendment to the fact that the leap year, it is clear that the dynamics of plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to an additional working day.
Add to this a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight transportation, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data, and plus-minus 0.5% of the half-year volume can also be explained by seasonality," explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lowering price pressure.
In July, consumer price index was 7.2% compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks Rosstat records deflection.
Prices in Russia declined for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble, which, although showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, after August, has strengthened by 12% since the beginning of the year.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy," Yakovenko emphasizes.
In addition, since April in Russia there is an increase in industrial production.
In June, the figure rose by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May slow down.
Positive dynamics also demonstrate the situation in the labor market, where the unemployment rate decreased to 5.4%.
Below it was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the safe situation in the labor market, the issue with real available incomes of the population to leave much to be desired.
In annual terms, the figure is reduced by 4.8%.
This factor can inhibit the recovery of the economy, as household expenditures make a considerable contribution to the GDP.
As a rule, in the structure of the economy their share exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia's tough policy can also be called as risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator holds the rate at 10.5%, which is not the best effect on the real sector.
Negative factor is not high level of investment, which restrains the development of industrial potential.
But in general, we can assume that by the end of the year the rate of the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015," - says Irina Rogov, analyst of the State Committee of Forex Club.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and perfectly in the winter sports at the Olympic Games in Sochi, is not so actively developed in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and speak former foreigners, in most cases we are talking about the natives of the countries - the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process - quite a large number of Russians perform under the flags of other countries.
In each case, the history of changing citizenship is different.
Some parents were taken to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone did not stand the competition for a place in the Russian team.
And someone considered that abroad will be created the best conditions for development in sports.
"AiF.ru" found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In the German passport of 27-year-old girl it is written that her name is Lisa Ryzhikh.
But earlier she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to go in the footsteps of her elder sister - to engage in athletics.
Just like her sister, Lisa chose pole jumps.
She stayed in Russia, it would hardly be able to "move from the throne" Elena Isinbayeva.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio Lisa will be the only countryman, albeit former, in the sector for pole jumps.
Its best achievements in this sport - the bronze of the European Championship 2010 and silver continental championship in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the evangelistic direction.
Many of them because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight more children grew up in the family.
They all lived in a small town of Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena began to get carried away by the struggle at school.
Showing good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where at the US Training Center continued classes under the guidance of another former Russian Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first battle.
But at the World Cup in the same year - a victory.
Before that, by the way, she managed to win silver at the world championship in 2010.
After that there were bronze 2013 and silver 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in Yaroslavl, where she first met with synchronized swimming.
But it would be wrong to say that it was brought up by our coaches in Russia.
Soon the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Freya continued her classes.
Soon she was already a member of the U.S. national team and showed great results at the Pan-American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level, it cannot compete with Russian synchronists, but for America its indicators are the ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, Kristina Shaldybin received at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue training the girl rhythmic gymnastics over the ocean.
Until then, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
Having emigrated to the United States, she quickly joined the youth team of this country, and later burst into the main national team.
At the Pan-American Games 19-year-old Christen won gold and silver.
For the first position on the world stage, of course, it did not have to fight, but for the United States she organized a real breakthrough - brought a star-striped team to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former "artress" - Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who stands for the national team of Germany.
Yana was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more prospects to get into the national team.
Soon she represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, however, Jana was able to take only 17th place, insufficient to get into the finals in the individual championship.
But two years before that, she managed to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games - youth.
Another gymnast, only this time sports - Irina Sazonova.
If the ways of emigration of the previously mentioned athletes can be called standard, then the choice of Irina's family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a pupil of Volgograd sports school.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became the champion of the country.
However, Ira is still training in Russia - he specially comes to his homeland in order not to lose his skills.
In Rio she did not perform as well as she would like.
The best place - 40 in the individual all-around.
There are very few reports about swimmer Maria Ugolkova in the Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria lives and trains in Switzerland.
However, for a long time she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a record of the country at a distance of 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to perform under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance - 14th place in the complex relay 4x100.
To get on the game, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6 thousand francs, which allowed her to pay for the preparation for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle fighter Adam Batirov spent almost all his career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time winner of the European Championships, the champion of Russia, the master of sports of Russia of international class.
When he stopped entering our national team, it's time to think about changing citizenship.
For several years, the talented fighter disappeared from the sports bridges.
The triumphal return took place at the Asian Championship 2016 - Batirov has already represented Bahrain, for whom he won the gold medal and received a ticket to the Olympic Games in Rio.
About another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, is even less known in his homeland than even about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkov.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand, when the boy was quite small.
It was there that Mikhail began to engage in gymnastics.
He did not achieve great success at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in qualification on parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympic Games in gymnastics - already a breakthrough.
When Nast, who was born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There the girl continued her classes synchronous swimming, showing good results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronized swimming.
In a duet with Eugenia Tetelbaum Anastasia took eighth place.
In the solo program she was the fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Croyter stands for the national team of Israel.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry has already become the champion of the country.
In the same year, he won in the youth world championship.
A year later, Croyter wins the gold of the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to jumping in height, Dmitry is engaged in jumping in length and triple jump.
Albert, 31, is another native of Khasavyurt, who after long speeches for Russia decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he also played for the School of Higher Sports Mastery of Krasnoyarsk, in 2011 even becoming the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the USSR volleyball team player Yaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player of the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
There the family remained for permanent residence.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he won the bronze medal of the European Championship, held on the territory of his new homeland.
Hadzhiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and got together with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country - had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimkhan continued to learn freestyle wrestling.
Soon he won the world championship among juniors, and later qualified for participation in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
And again a freestyle struggle, and again a former Russian.
This time we will talk about a native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain - Taimuraz Fryeva.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and currently he stands for the national team of the country.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to note high results in Russia.
He became the bronze medalist of the country's championships in 2007 and 2008.
Tied from the failure to enter the national team, Taimuraz decided to change sports citizenship.
The last on our list is the Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Makhachkala, - Artur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur, on the advice of his eldest brother, began to box.
Since then, Arthur three times became the champion of Canada, and in 2012 became the world champion among young people.
In 2015 Biyarslanov won the gold of the Pan-American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Why do children need Cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratiev, "the Cossacks need to be brought up not by actions and parades, but systematically."
They should grow and at least from the age of 7 to understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossacks.
But as long as this work, it seems to me, is being carried out formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes will take into itself all the positive, which has accumulated earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I will be glad.
If everything is drunk and unknowingly as, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
Housing and utilities are still one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
There are encroachments on the funds allocated for the needs of the communal sector from the budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General's Office, the inflated tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the sphere of housing and communal services.
As a result, consumers of the region overpaid more than 170 million rubles to power engineers.
Recently, the prosecutor's office of the Krasnodar region revealed the facts of inclusion in the tariffs of unreasonable costs.
And in the costs of LLC "IV-consulting" (submissive cold water) were laid 4 million rubles. for car rental at a price higher than the market.
And such examples in the country are mass.
The people give the last money for the "community," and pays properly, - according to the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of proceeds from crime, abuse of power, etc.
According to the investigators, as the head of the fund, who was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, the work on them was not actually carried out, but paid.
Businessmen just returned most of the money to him.
As the owner of the Criminal Code, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers did not pay and spent them on their own needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and residents - millions of rubles.
The scheme of Makarov's machinations is, alas, typical for Russia.
A wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the Criminal Code, who were awarded money to citizens, swept the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan, by the way, is also a former deputy of the city council, who is accused of machinations for 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013 in Elizovo, Kamchatka region, he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract works for the Criminal Code, two others played the role of cash settlement centers, that is, they took money from the population.
However, A. Kohan did not transfer funds to power engineers, but spent on himself, beloved.
Judging in the sphere of housing and communal services is quite difficult.
The cases are not excited, tightened.
And "helps" this extremely confusing housing legislation, - says Svetlana Razvorotneva, executive director of PN "ZhKH Control."
We do not have time to earn one law, as we come up with a new one, which should make the previous one work.
Specialists, including among judges, on housing and communal services are also not enough.
The lawyers themselves admit that the housing law in universities is paid very little attention.
The Prosecutor General's Office also speak about the refusal to initiate criminal cases, the Prosecutor General's Office speak about the refusal to initiate criminal cases.
Out of 3.5 thousand crimes in 2015, less than half of the crimes were sent to the court.
According to the rest of the investigation, the protracted nature, and every fifth was suspended due to the failure of the accused.
Often the shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement agencies are written off for gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the organs of inquiry do not hurry to incite and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015 there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting - only 60 criminal cases were opened.
For 5 months of this year, their number increased only slightly - 99.
And what is the falsification of the minutes of the meeting of residents?
This means: the change of management of the house, financial and other issues go bypassing the opinions of the owners.
And this means that the market of housing and communal services can not get through normal companies that want to work honestly, and not "to "eating" the population.
It turns out that tenants are minus, small and medium-sized businesses too.
First of all, due to the eradication of corruption as such in the whole state, says Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property Issues.
And now this work is being actively carried out.
These are not just single actions - it is a purposeful course to fight corruption.
Of course, not in all regions such a sad situation.
In particular, scandals in the capital and do not smell.
Why is there no such scandals in housing and communal services in Moscow, as in many other regions?
Yes, because the Moscow government has shown iron will and brought order, - said "AiF" Anatoly Election, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean both the personnel issue and the legislative amendments and legal education.
The management companies have a close supervision and all of them have passed through licensing.
Complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in the public space (and appeals of residents, and response measures are placed on the portal of the Government of Moscow).
Many not just pay monthly receipts, but carefully monitor what is written there, as the house is contained.
The awareness among the population about the rights of owners and obligations of resource supplying and managing organizations is very high.
Plus Moscow checks the validity of tariffs for housing and communal services - after all, a considerable part of budgetary funds goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Probably all this together explains the calm situation in Moscow.
So, everything rests on the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe the launtary should change the place of work?
Turkish gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan nominated the United States ultimatum, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d"état.
He said this, speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan urged the Americans to abandon the support of the "terrorist organization of the fetkhullahists."
This is not the first statement from Turkey, in which the U.S. calls to change its position.
Experts believe that the split in relations between Turkey and the West is growing and can lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
"Sooner or later America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO ("Terrorist organization of the fethullahists").
Either the organizing coups of FETO, or democratic Turkey.
It should make this choice," - quotes the Anatoliy Agency Erdogan's address, sounded on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but already tougher demanded from the United States to fulfill his request, announced for the first time immediately after the suppression of the mutiny.
Recall that on the night of July 16 in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army attempted to overthrow the legitimate power in the country, as well as an attempt to assassinated the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Erdogan made an appeal to the population, the mutiny was suppressed, and its organizers and participants were arrested.
In total, about 8 thousand people were suspected, in the ranks of which, in addition to the military, were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gulen, living in Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan's supporters also admitted that the coup d'etat could be involved and directly Americans.
The U.S. denied all claims, refusing to issue Gulen and advised to change the tone.
The last statement of the State Department representatives was made at the time of Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the president of Turkey - he insists on his own and also puts forward demands to other Western partners.
"Ankar will cease to fulfill its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union, if Brussels does not name the date of the abolition of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," - said the Minister of Turkey for EU Affairs Omer Chelik on August 9.
According to him, the introduction of amendments to the anti-terrorist law by Ankara, as required by the EU, will jeopardize its own security in Europe.
It should be noted that on August 1, German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded Turkey to stop the blackmail of the European Union with promises to open borders for migrants to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were a response to the statement of the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement by Chavushoglu made last Wednesday, admitting that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The Turkish Foreign Minister did not rule out that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance, if it did not meet the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defense sector is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign states in the defense sector - they are importing missiles," Chavushoglu said in an interview with Anadolu.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system on the basis of its technologies, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
"Until now, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member states, but the results have not satisfied us, and we began to look for others," the Minister said.
Experts believe that all this speaks about the serious disagreements between Turkey and the West and the reorientation of the country to the East.
Yevgeny Minchenko, head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go to a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot of things to the West and from the point of view of business, and from the point of view of the military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance, maintaining framework relations with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a completely obedient person in this post," the expert explained.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (on non-payment of compensations to the EU, the requirement of visa-free space with Europe and the issuance of Gulen from the United States) will be pressured.
"Rejep Erdogan will face the deterioration of relations with both America and the European Union, and they will put pressure on him on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governing the country, and so on," - said Minchenko.
Alexei Mukhin, head of the Political Information Center, admits that the President of Turkey will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as he benefits.
Eight months ago, Erdogan held an extremely tough position in relation to Russia and in all ways sought favor in the West.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that after some time the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again.
I think Erdogan has entered the period of shuttle diplomacy.
Having between the two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Mukhin said.
In his opinion, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to keep the political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnership relations with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States will cease to support Gyulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States, which, with its help, control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, the consensus with Turkey will be reached," the expert believes.
Anna Glazova, head of the Center for Asia and the Middle East, is of a different view.
Now the relations between Turkey and the EU and the United States are quite tense, and this is primarily due to the internal policy pursued by Erdogan personally.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reset politics both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel are resolved, there is an active political cooperation with Iran," said AiF.ru Glazova, admitting that Erdogan's next step will be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
According to her, Erdogan's policy is now being pursued - a return to the course of the foreign policy concept, which was followed by Turkey before the Arab revolutions.
"It is then on the positions of "noble problems with neighbors" Turkey began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region very actively.
Now there have been very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and Africa.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey's position both in the regional and international arena," the expert believes.
Glazova believes that it will be incredibly difficult to return Turkey to the previous relations with the EU, now the question is whether the EU will toughly respond to Turkey, which can go to the opening of borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Strike of junior doctors: calls for new collective protests
Representatives of junior doctors asked the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over the new employment contract.
The Committee of Junior Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask its full advice to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC says the ministers failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Younger doctors and medical students voted in July for the abolition of the employment contract agreement with BMA.
It was rejected 58% of its members who participated in the secret voting.
In a letter to Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC Chairman Elen McCorth said that the government continued to "snortly keep silent" about the problems she said, which, as she said, led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: "Given the current situation, the JDC leader voted to deviate the proposed new employment contract in full and called for official re-negotiation on all your issues."
In response to the government's silence, the head of JDC today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuous program of expansion of collective protests, starting early September.
The dispute led to the fact that young doctors took part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of junior doctors of the BMA, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after voting for the abolition of the agreed terms of the employment contract, which recommended BMA.
He told the BMA members that the deal was good, which should be accepted during the meetings on the eve of the voting of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the voting, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that this employment contract will be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "The Alliance of the Bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had a stable impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked strained, and he hardly radiated warmly even according to his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in contrast, said many times about his "expensive friend" to Mr. Putin five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia will return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan's actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But the prolonged coolness, coming from Mr. Putin, showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in the opening comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this moment was furious.
Mr. Putin broke out with an angry tyra, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
Insulting was even stronger on the basis of a supposed friend.
Restoration of real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
During the months, the state-controlled media conducted a stunning, total offensive to Ankara.
It seemed sudden that the Turks should be considered guilty of everything.
The most serious accusations were from representatives of the top leadership that Erdogan's own family had made money on illegal oil trade from Syria's so-called Islamic Emirate.
He denied it resolutely.
But in St. Petersburg there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin received an apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim victory of a kind.
For Ankara, the advantages of the ceasefire announcement are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost overthrown from his post last month when he tried to coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions strongly hit - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast annually.
The number fell sharply by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here, of course, will feel relief when the flights will finally resume.
They put on the peak of the end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish import of agricultural products will be allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as stated in the report in the Vedomosti newspaper.
But the visit also had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is evil in the West for the fact that it considers a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this its protracted dissatisfaction with the skulling pace of conversations about joining the EU and the step of Mr. Putin - who seeks to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy the Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for support of elected authorities after an attempted coup d"état.
Keep in mind, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deeply rooted fear of changing the regime.
So, the summit in this brilliant palace on the sea coast allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as "the bad altyans": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West, unite forces.
However, despite the public display of reconciliation, these two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
Perhaps it is said for the fact that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents were giving a press conference, they did not even touch the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility, taking into account the possibility of a complete catastrophe, when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter, it is better that the two leaders at least speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
The brand RBS should be reduced to the role of back office, according to the executive director of the bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and it had to be saved.
During this period, the brand's strategists used "RBS" to protect other brands of consumer lending.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship to international sports, from the Six Nations Cup in rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it was decided that it was correct to allow more national brands to come to the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to the RBS, including the external headquarters and the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for banking services of individuals who will gain more influence of Coutts, Adam &amp; Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during a tour of clients and employees in Inverness.
He told BBC Scotland: "RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be employed, because we are now becoming a larger brand bank."
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I now say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship support of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building up the profile of various brands in sponsoring sports.
"This is the right time for us to move the brand bank, as we have been based on (we asked ourselves) how we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said that we are going to be a wonderful bank for customers and would close all these brands.
But with the work we did, focusing on the needs of customers, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can return these brands again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Deetteri reaches 3,000 winners with a victory in Newmarket at the bias
Dethrowers sprinkles champagne, after a double in Newmarket leads him to 3000 wins
Jockey Frankie Deetteri achieved his 3000 British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second night winner on his home path - on the bias taught by John Gosden.
45-year-old Italian is the sixth toy, which reached this outstanding mark in smooth jumps.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Dugo Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Iddery, and Willy Carson.
Three-time champion of the Jockey Dettory, who previously won at Ghayyar, said, "This is something special."
I am very excited because my family is here too
I am very glad that it happened in Newmarket, as it was here that I settled 30 years ago.
This is not a big secular event, it is not Royal Ascot - it is the usual Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am free from business and very unprediced.
Deetteri accepts applause when it leads Predisposition after victory
Two Jokes reached such a mark in the obstacle races: the champion of the Joke Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McKa, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record career.
Leicester Piggott, nine-time winner of Derby, 4493 wins in his career
Franks is one of the best jackeys of the modern era and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few reached him before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical wit makes it different from others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for races, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans in this sport for years.
I told Franki a few weeks ago in Epsom, he would bring 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big races!
And if serious, Franki brought the winners in the UK most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is an energetic character that is good for British races, but moreover, he is an incredible jackey.
Franki Deettery celebrated this outstanding mark with a branded rapid juice from the horse
From the rapid finishes to the rapid jumps, Franki Dethroty has been a symbol of British smooth jumps for two decades.
They were ups and downs.
A lot of winners of big races, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and stayed in disqualification because of doping.
Three years ago he first encountered difficulties when he returned after a six-month disqualification, but he showed a great willpower to challenge the skeptics and return to form.
And he may not have finished for a while - Deetteri said earlier that he would like to continue to participate in the competition, at least up to 50 years of age.
Putin dismisses Sergei Ivanov's head of administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his head of the administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trustee's close circle over the years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed a representative of the environment and transport.
The statement from the Kremlin says that Putin "has ordered Ivanov to be released from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but did not mention the reason.
Deputy Mr. Ivanov since 2012, Anton Vaino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Vaino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later he was the head of the protocol of the president and the government apparatus, reports the website of the Kremlin (in Russian).
During his appointment, he told Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as the head of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are fulfilled.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to dismiss him from this post and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Do you like smiles?
This is a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As the head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on the state television, both men said that the head of the administration resigned at their own will.
But despite the smiles on the camera, few people have convinced here especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these unforeseen consequences of some struggle for power?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement that the person, for whom he was once agitated as a potential president, suddenly wanted to manage the Russian environmental policy - was met with huge skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "This is true that in early 2012 I asked you to trust me this very complicated position, even for four years.
Well, it turns out, I was the head of the presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Previously, he worked as Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB's state security service, as well as Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who came to replace the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
Once it was believed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as Putin's third term would be contrary to the constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister until returning to presidency after only three and a half years.
Star TV series "Thought as a Criminal" Thomas Gibson fired after a fight with the producer
Gibson was a participant of a brawl on the shootings of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday, before it was announced his removal.
There were creative differences on filming and discrepancy in opinions.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how the character Gibson will be erased from the show, which is monitored by the FBI agent team, is expected to come later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
54-year-old actor, who previously played a major role in the sitcom Darma and Greg, was in the show from the first season in 2005.
"I love "Thought as a Criminal" and invested my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I hoped to be present in it to the end, but now it will be impossible.
I would just like to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful team, and, most importantly, the best fans, of which the show could only dream of.
It is planned that the show will return with its twelfth season on September 28.
The riddle: the fish landed in the garden of Banfa
A man from Banfa asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be sandstones left by a waterstorm.
Bean, living 500 meters from the sea, put a filming of this spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone will be able to shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferi Crossing: The bridge is now connected to Faif
1.35 billion pounds project now to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the northern span and the Quinsferry Crossing's viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faif.
This is the first of the four sacks between the "veers of the canvas," which are now coming to the end of all three saws of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Faif is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vans of the bridge.
The 1.35 billion pounds project is now to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Kit Brown today visited the site and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferi Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering really epic in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and have been used only for the construction of this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the closing of the gear between the viaduct and the bridge is a virtuoso operation using extremely accurate build permits.
In total, about 79% of the total bridge is now on the spot, for the last section of the canvas, the concrete coating is poured into Rosite today, which means that everything is ready to climb the place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first clamping on each bridge project is always a milestone.
In this amazing project, this clamping is the most modern construction art.
After the installation of the last section of the roadway and its connection with the expanding North Pylon roadway, we had to close the remaining clearance on the northern side or facing the shore.
This was done by pulling the viaduct of the northern approach to 700 millimeters south.
It was a large-scale and at the same time very graceful operation.
Large-scale, because the viaduct length of 222 meters weighs about 6,000 tons and was to be raised to the angle of inclination of about 3 %.
Graceful, because the tolerances the team was working on were tiny - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, all this went very well.
Rescue in the Moelfel-Freun: Troy men 'lucky stay alive'
Three men 'lucky stay alive were after they were thrown out of a fishing vessel to Anglcy.
The rescue station Moelfre RNLI raised alarm at 13:20 British summer time on Friday, after the team saw the incident unfolding in the Moelfre Celebank.
Three men tried their best to sail to a safe place, while their ship continued to go.
"We saw their ship circling next to them and supposed the worst," said the Moelfre's steering boat Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, by the time we came down to the water, a strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued with the help of a local fishing vessel, and the third man of 60 years was found wear and caught in the buoy without a life jacket.
They were all raised on board the coastal rescue boat and taken to the rescue station
Jones said, "Three men thrown into the water were lucky that they were alive and completely intact.
The engine of the boat had an emergency shutdown, but somehow he unhooked from the man who was driving the boat when it overturned.
Someone guarded these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time looking into the screens, was a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go tears people off from the sofa and involves some physical activity.
The screen time was initially limited to TV, then video games and recently smartphones.
It is so great to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I, of course, mean the funeral fascination that Pokémon Go is, an application based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (later the series of cartoons, playing cards and other branches).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all this has lost its former relevance a little earlier than this new game has become available in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launching in other countries at that time was detained due to the massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost the same as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players with smartphones are going to look for Puckmons that are tracked by GPS and, being discovered, can be 'photographed' (through a screenshot on your phone) or 'climbers'.
The generation that played the game, being younger, joined the sl why, torn off the sofas to search.
In the U.S., the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps passed by a "ordining" person daily.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people tracked by them, who daily performed 30-minute exercises, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays in Pokémon Go, it just sees the initial data on passing levels.
Many health campaigns that convince people to "find 30 minutes," "to get off the sofa" and "to be active every day," have not found a response, because most health messages are boring and expressed by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight correction, high arterial pressure, diabetes and still a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the love of Pokémon Go is that it pulls people out into the street to do what they love.
Thus, there are three basics of health: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring nudes, who are looking for what to complain about.
And yes, someone can stumble on the door.
Well, what about?
The breakthrough occurred.
After all, despite the fact that applications for smartphones, such as Fitbit, could have been tracking our physical activity before, they did not give us a reason for classes, as this game gives.
The novelty will come and the use will weaken over time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon will appear more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Byles wins the gold of the absolute championship in women's gymnastics
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the turmoil.
Simone Byles is invulnerable to all this.
Dynamic on the vault.
Unforced on a log.
The slescent on the floor.
Awesome everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of champion in absolute championship on Thursday, placing a chasm between each other and the rest of the world at a convincing demonstration under close Olympic attention.
Her total score 62.198 was at a sufficient distance from the silver medalist and teammate "Final Pyatka" Elie Riceman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Bijlz from the United States performs at the gymnastics log during the final of the women's individual absolute championship in rhythmic gymnastics at 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bijlz became the fourth consecutive American woman who won the title of champion of the absolute championship and fifth in general, securing his reputation as the best of his generation and, perhaps, whenever it was.
She insleed when she showed her final overall score and her long journey had ended by this moment.
This achievement puts it in the same league as exceptionally rare athletes such as Michael Felps, who raised their sports to new heights:
Bijlz spent the last three years, dominating in her sport, winning 15 medals of the World Cup - including 10 gold - with such stunning programs in their mixture of hard work and accuracy that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lu Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One last test waited in Brazil, the competition is not so much between Bijlz and the rest in this area, as between her and the weight of inflated expectations.
Anyer less than going back to his family's house in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be regarded as an unjustified expectation.
Simone Byles from the United States, on the left, and Eli Riceman are tempt after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual absolute championship in rhythmic gymnastics at the Summer Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Bijlz earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of the retired coordinator of the national team Marta Caroli.
While Bylz insisted that she had never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, that's not quite the case.
Part of her free exercise program is the one that includes her signature passage - installed on Latin American music, which would be suitable just like a house on the street right outside the Olympic Arena Rio.
This is not a coincidence.
The girl, conceded by her grandfather and grandmother, being a beginner to walk with a child and an open mother of coach Amy Burman during a visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She has not lost any competition in absolute championship since the summer of 2013 - a band of luck, which should last as long as Bylz wants it.
Despite the fact that Mustafin got a small advantage with two spins, it was a mirage.
Gymnastic log and freestyle exercises - where Bylz defends the title of world champion - lie in an ambush.
She went forward again with 15,433 on the log and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Riceman gently hugged her while they were waiting for the final account - a pure formality and tears appeared around the shiny red with white and blue eyeliner Bijlz's eyebrews, when the plan she had once recorded in the clipping album, was realized.
Riceman's speech was a little revenge for the incident four years ago, when she shared third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafin on the tie-break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "babushka" was much ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise, covered by a return, which sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Bijlz, the virus tweet 19-year-old from the beginning of this week now has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in the case of serial killer shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most deadly attack in the case of the first serial killer of Phoenix in the last decade, sat in the car, talked and listened to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochel Lainer, Stephanie R. Ellis and daughter Ellis, Malia, were shot on June 12, when their car was parked on the roadway, the authorities said.
The criminal made about eight shots from the pistol, standing on the passenger side of the car, after which he disappeared on another vehicle, the report reported.
The police claim that the triple murder, apparently, is not the result of robbery, as the attacker did not take wallets or $2,900, which were at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
The police representative of Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting prompted the investigators to check whether he was associated with the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others were injured as a result of nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas for four months.
"This happens in a residential area in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, a branch of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including the brown Nissan late 1990s, the black BMW late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were connected with each other and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33 years old, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31 years old, and the daughter of Ellis, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual in the fact that they were sitting in a parked car, listening to music.
The authorities also published a report on the shelling, the purpose of which was an empty pickup in half an hour before the triple murder and who is believed to have been the case of a serial killer.
The investigators found the sleeves and extracted the bullet from the seat and the bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephalia: "Becomes better"
Like most six-year-old children, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund's microcephalia is the result of a genetical disorder about which his mother Elisabeth Piksivto did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do it.
I didn't sign up for that.
That, in fact, is not true - of course you subscribe to it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent said that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even proposed to put it in a specialized medical institution.
"My first answer was: I did not think that people are doing so," explained Pixivto.
Edmund walks with the help of walks.
Edmund did not sit and crawl until he was three, and he still does not speak.
But it slowly passes some stages.
He walks with outside help and rides a bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and singing.
Elisabeth shows the gesture Edmund came up for "pity, sleep to me."
"We teach him the language of gestures," said Pixivto CBS News.
But not just the usual sign language - she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalia may occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and forecasts can vary significantly.
It is too early to talk about how it will affect the lives of those who are infected with the Zika virus.
Pixivto recalls emotional losses due to uncertain future.
I have always said what would happen?
What will happen?
And she still does not know.
I didn't really ask for a life forecast because I don't expect someone to really tell me.
But Pixivto has an encouraging advice for mothers of children with congenital defects due to Zika.
It becomes better.
You know that everything will be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding cause rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
A heavy rain and a large-scale flood in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, while even more rainfall is expected to fall over the state until Saturday inclusive.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of Mississippi came out of the shores and threaten with a large flood after the extreme rainfall, the National Meteorological Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and the assistance has already left for the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Office of the Governor for National Security and Readiness for Emergency Situations, said that there are requests for transport for high water, boats and sandbags.
Styl said that only the arrival of Tanjipaho asked tens of thousands of sandbags.
The danger of the flood remains in force until Saturday in most of the south of Louisiana.
The Meteorical Service said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches can be indid with the area.
In southern Alabham, duty in anticipation of the flood was in effect until Friday, as the rain continued to go in the area of Mobile.
The Komit River near Baton-Ruze and the Aimite River next to Den, Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set a flood record last weekend.
Synoptic Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton-Ruzha.
He also said that the flood going downstream in Assensen's parish is a threat, as these slack rivers will slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of Mississippi's border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest of the ever registered levels at 9 am Friday.
Rescuers still pulled people out of the floods in the districts of Aymit and Wilkinson in the south-west of Mississippi.
Leo Hansford, his wife and stepfather were among those rescued early on Friday near Glosser.
Hansford, 62 years old, says that the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his house, quickly rose overnight.
He said that another stepfather who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water continued to come," Hansford said.
It reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that this was the biggest influx she had seen in 48 years that she had lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family had a disability, and he was the only one who knows how to swim.
Hansford said that the rescue service rescued all three with the help of an army truck and delivered them to the fire station in Glostre, where they sheltered on Friday.
Krautmann says that the flood "has spread rapidly," as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering the order to evacuate.
Krautmann says that one observer near Livingston reported a fall of 13.75 inches of rain from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil was oversaturated with rainfall from Wednesday.
The strong rain and flooding of streets led to the rescue of residents from homes in the parish of Tanjipaho and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, the authorities say.
WWL, CBS branch, reports that the adviser to Tanjipahoa told about 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, but they are both now flooded.
Chairman of the parish Robbie Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets in high water.
The shelters were opened in the city of Aimite and Hammond to receive those who were evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts retreating," he said.
In Hammond, the parish of Tanjipaho, about two dozen streets were closed due to the high level of water, and sandbags were available for the issuance of residents in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and enterprises.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lиxe Landrum, city governor.
It is on the way to become a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison District, Head of Emergency Services Rupert Leisy said that the cover rain continued to go on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none was registered on Friday.
Kate Touson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store in Aimit, lives in the area of 40 years.
"I have seen water in the places where I have never seen it before," said Tauson, " and she still pours on the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "resolved by bullets" survives after the shooting in Philadelphia
The police reported that in Philadelphia fired at a 6-year-old boy, registering a second shooting in the 6-year-old in the city this week.
The grandmother and grandfather of the child identified him for the CBS Philadelphia as Mahazh Brown.
Grandmother and grandfather say Brown received numerous firearms wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot, his little body was smitten by bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melandez station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in the hospital in critical condition and has experienced several operations.
The family said the station that it is expected to recover.
He had to go to the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of the four men in which they fired in the quarter of Germantown.
They also fired in three men: two 29-year-old and one 32-year-old.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-old men - in critical condition; the other two victims were registered in a stable state, according to the CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the front seat of the car next to 29-year-old in critical condition, reports the station.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the wounded men could be fired.
Investigators report to the CBS Philadelphia that there seemed to be a skirmish between several armed people.
The hyls from semi-automatic weapons, attributed to different copies of semi-automatic weapons, stylated the place of action.
It seems that this was definitely a long battle.
There were sleeves on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, to all appearances, there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting," said the police captain of Philadelphia Anthony Ginaldi.
Many houses and cars in this area were also stingy.
No arrests were made, and the police, according to reports, are watching CCTV cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was struck by a shoal bullet on Tuesday when playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
It is being restored, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I call the women's Olympic team for gymnastics this year and for several reasons.
First, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And the second: three gymnasts play a key role in this team: Simona Byles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this national team, supplemented by Elie Riceman, who is a Jew, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team looks like America at last.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of this sport.
Over the past four years, the female gymnast number one was African American.
Last year, Simon and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's powerful.
At last Olympics Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed approvingly.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of the three-time World Champion Simona Byles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected, but nevertheless virtuosic gymnastics exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American in a row, who won gold in the women's individual absolute championship.
A colleague in the national team Elie Riceman earned silver.
We witness the peak of this sport, but it does not look like this in the gymnastics sections throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same way as Eli and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the "final five," because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of coaching Marta Caroli.
But in reality gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastics clubs, supported by parents paying the cost of training, equipping, travel, form, fees for participation in competitions, payment of hotel services (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are located where gymnasts receive everything from their trainings, and it is an expensive and long-term duty for the families of gymnasts.
Amy Burman, Simona Byles coach, and Maggie Hani, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must create a more affordable and affordable training in gymnastics to the number of young girls inspired by Simona, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics classes located in Harlem, for more than 15,000 city young children (mostly black and Latin Americans) and brought up national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (My hometown) to provide high-quality youth gymnastics, which deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for body, as well as resistance to deer work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a positive impact throughout life on good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and it is great.
Doing sports is so important, especially for girls.
Now is such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Eli, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the "Women's Force" in winning the team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different origins to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Younger doctors took up the announcement of further strikes after the rejection of the proposal by Jeremy Hunt
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing a modified agreement with the heads of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the voting rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce this contract, saying that the NHS was on the "nothing land" and any subsequent delay would damage the staff and patients.
The first younger doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in employment at night and weekend to improve service during extracurricular time.
Dr. Elen McCocot, Chairman of the Committee of Young Doctors of the BMA, said last night in a statement: "The younger doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular, that he will feed the existing labor crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly."
There are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors will be transferred to a new contract, it is necessary to progress, and time is over.
The WMA's attempt to resolve the dispute was met by the reluctance to take action and sometimes completely silence from the government.
And this despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremie Hunts must act now, inspire the introduction and respond to the fears of younger doctors.
If he does not, then the younger doctors are unequivocal that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The last surge at the end of April brought a delay of about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses, while nurses and consultants were attracted to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing a modified agreement with the heads of the British Medical Association.
The WMA wants a better payment for the weekend for 54,000 junior doctors who will fall under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortymer said: "The strikes reach little or nothing, but put pressure on the already working at the limit of the team and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorders to patients, nurses and their families."
Over the past two months, we have talked to the Committee of Junior Doctors and together with the Health and the Health Department and others, positively responded to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate awareness policies.
The workers hoped that the continued positive assistance on other important topics, such as the distribution of personnel, the flexibility of training, additional training for those who returned after a break in their careers, the cost of training, the mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender differences in the payment of medical work was a sign of how serious the employers, Health Education England and the Health Care Department were going to respect the conditions achieved in May and February.
The drug for 2 - per day can reduce the threat of heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use the drug for 2nd day, after the authorities recommended to give it to more people and for a longer time.
The anti-concitting drug ticigreor reduces the risk of repeated attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or a new attack.
The NICE Supervision Service of the UK National Health Service advised people to give it to people for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, now the NICE Supervision Service of the UK National Health Service advised to give it to people for four years to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The heart attack occurs with approximately 140,000 people in England annually, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fatty material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the cans are torn apart, it can cause clots that block blood access to the heart and cause a heart attack.
And if clots move, he will be able to move through the blood flow and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already oversubstanged one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Tikaglelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making the clots less likely.
The NICE draft manual, published today, recommends that people give 90 mg of ticgerera for 12 months, then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day over the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, Director of the Center for Medical Technology Assessment, said: "Despite the presence of effective methods of secondary prevention with about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Repetition fears can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that the ticigreor in combination with aspirin is effective when reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
Pre-recommending ticigreor, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
Since the information on the effectiveness and safety of the ticigre is particularly at the risk of bleeding - for the expiration of three years is limited, the draft instructions do not recommend treatment longer than this period.
The culture of PC ownership allows to thrive the falsification of vote count in Muslim areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year due to corruption, serving as a shock to the government's report
The culture of political correctness led to the closing of the eyes, which resulted in the widespread falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim communities, according to the information from the devastating report of the government, published today.
Former member of the Cabinet, Sir Eric Pikles, criticizes the police, observers of the election and city administration for ignoring the election violations due to "the excessive sensitivity to race and religion."
Former secretary of local communities, now the anti-corruption tsar, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that the police should allow to put cordons outside the polling stations in order to protect the frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters should only specify their name and address.
The report even suggests to put indelable ink on the fingers of people when they pass their ballots, in order to exclude someone to vote twice.
It is necessary to provide better protection to the agourees, said Sir Eric.
He calls for more access to the documents of the local council and decisions made by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is done not only to protect itself from fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from an open culture of corruption and financial fraud going hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street due to a scandal with a vote in Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special court considering elections issues ruled that the incumbent mayor of Luftur Rahman was to be dismissed due to a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distort" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, as it was said, "has campaigned based on the duty of believers to Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were doubted or the result of the person voting, appearing to someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed special concerns about the swindling with voting by mail, in which senior members of the Muslim community, as reported, exerted pressure on people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations for cleaning the voting system, including the requirement to bring your identity card to prove who you are
The report says: "There were evidence of pressure exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and youth, to vote at the will of the older ones, especially in the communities of Pakistani and Bangladesh origin.
"There were fears that... state institutions have closed their eyes to such behavior due to the excessive sensitivity of "political correctness" about ethnicity and religion."
Eric Cheese gave 50 recommendations on cleaning the system, including the removal of political activists from working with postal ballots to stop "the harvest of votes."
The report, under the consideration of Theresa May, also calls for stricter checks during registration to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
It is considered the option to demand from voters to present an identity card before voting.
Use indelable ink on the fingers of people as soon as they throw their bulletin to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks of people's nationality to make sure they have the right to vote.
To introduce a three-year restriction on applications for automatic postal voting.
To exclude political participants of campaigns and activists from work with completed correspondence voting and envelopes with postal voting.
To give the police the authority to establish cordons around polling stations.
Change the law in order to facilitate the prosecution of people intimidation according to the Presentation of the People's Act 1983.
Photographing at polling stations is illegal.
To make a requirement that only English be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Enhine training to ensure that the staff forces voters to go to the booth one by one.
Sir Eric is fiercely attacking the city police, stating that it was "extingtect" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The court discussing the election issues disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corruption and illegal actions," he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of a reasonable doubt - the criminal standard of provenness - on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes unsuccessful "checks for ticks" of the electoral registration departments of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: "The last year's judgment of the court in Tower Hamlet was a signal to awaken.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and hidden dissemination of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
The madness of the bike analogue Kate and other doubles of the celebrities of the Olympics in Rio
The fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy about the French cyclist Polin Ferran-Prevo, which, as it turned out, is impressively similar to Duchess Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old participant of the Olympic Games is not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, which can boast of its own famous double - at least, according to reports in social networks.
So, in honor of the Games Rio and all the famous faces appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL compiled a list of Olympians who have more than superficial similarity with Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: US Archer Brady Ellison, men's team on the left, compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's double on the bike path, many people online hurried to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of the superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. archer men's team Brady Allison was the cause of the hurricane on Twitter, after the images of his, looking frighteningly like the Wolf star with Wall Street.
And in fact, the archer learned about the madness of social networks and admitted that he had heard that he was like Leo since he was a child.
"I personally do not see a huge similarity, maybe with the exception of vegetation on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012, will undoubtedly indicate even more this year: a striking similarity between the British jumper Greg Razerford and the popular actor Nile Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large expressive eyes, as they say, is an exact copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estephan.
And in the pool of the South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burga compared with the star Hora Matthew Morrison for many years.
Going to a more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a "sports version" of the actor "Beginning"
Another long-awaited comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who can boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The silver medalist swimmer from Russia Julia Yefimova boasts not only the same tanned skin and light hair as the actress AnnaLinn McCond, while Natan Adrian from the U.S. team, according to fans, looks like a "sporting version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt."
Sorry women: Football Star Hope Solo, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Decter, on the right, have the same shapes of face and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason that is based on the similar appearance of this pair
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to make public his delight that "the other Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
In fact, the US football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar shapes of face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of the actress Laura Linny, as well as the gold medal won gymnast Gabbi Douglas, who boasts his own beautiful broad smile, which looks like the smile of the star "Dobeys success" Gabriel Junion.

Analysis of Byron McDonald's fourth place at the finish line of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at the women's relay freestyle 4x200 m outraged on Wednesday the audience CBC in live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcasting company CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "start like a nan" and "did die as a pig" during the swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought that his microphone was turned off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final women's relay 4x200 m freestyle.
It was possible to hear McDonald, who was attracted to the team of commentators CBC, to "dilute her color," said: "This 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, started like a slack, died like a pig.
Thank you for this.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, who is 14 years old, sailed the second stage of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Raq, allowing Canadians to eliminate the lag from China.
Viewers across Canada quickly reacted online after being shocked in the tone and used expressions
Emmet McFarlein tweeted: "Is the CBC speaker just saying that a 14-year-old swimmer from China ' died like a pig????
This idiot did not understand that they were still on air."

We make it clear, Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, and not to her as a person.
Still, it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying that he did not think that his words were interpreted as an attack on the person.
'I would like to take advantage of the moment to apologize for the comment I made last evening after the women's relay, - he said at the broadcast of the Olympic Games on CBC'.
'I spoke of the swimmer's speech, not of her personally.
'It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I am very sorry.
The Primark buyer offended a woman who shamelessly tried the underwear in the middle of the store
The buyers did not know where to take the look, when a woman exposed to try on the panties, on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she tried how she looked in them, pulled them off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear in the store of the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folston.
Primark shop Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folston, where a woman tried knit panties before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at that time, said that after fitting underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the shopping hall, she took a couple of panties from the showcase, removed her own tights and panties and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a secluded place somewhere to do it, she just stood there, shameless."
"Everyone stared at when she took off the panties again, and they obviously didn't like it because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three other pairs before she finally decided that there was nothing she liked here, dressed again and went out.
"It doesn't seem like she was caring for her, or what she thought of a man who would eventually buy these cowards she tried."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson from Kent said, "How nasty to think that someone is going to take home the coward which someone else had already worn, and they weren't scented."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff seems to have tried to remove these garments from sale after she left the better."
"I would not like to come home with a new pair of women's coward and find out that another woman put on and took them off, and they weren't sneed."
The Primark representative said: "Primark is aware of the incident that happened in our store in Folston on Tuesday, August 9."
All the goods we are talking about have been withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself from attacks with a gun using a krav-maga
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it for you a little safer.
We talked to Ron Mispoly, a master of the ravage federation in New York to find out how to cope with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you come from the front or behind, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his same weapon.
If you come from behind, according to the Ghost, the first thing to do is to unfold so that you see the attacker and 'free the fire line'.
Then you tightly compress the gun between your forearm and shoulder, before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee in the groin, and while the attacker bends in pain, you twist the pistol out of his hands, beat it in the face with the barrel and go back, holding the weapon put on it.
For an armed, suitable front, the way to perform is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and unscrew it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the gun and hit the attacker with your fist in your chest, then pull the gun out of his grip before you move back and target it.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how it does the Ghost.
But remember that the safest way out of any robbery - if you are not a master of the krav-mag - it is to give your cash.
For the guide traveler Jan Wright conducts his language to the most dirty places in Europe
The British traveler has undergone its immune system and vomiting reflex to a serious test, licking some of the most dirty and nasty places in Europe.
The host and author of the books about travels Jan Wright, 51 years old, from Suffolk, conducted the language of the euro banknote, the railings of Cirque Pikadili, the button of washing the toilet on the train and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of its immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what it climbs into.
But the experiment, which should become a film called "The Guide to the Traveler-Lizun on the Inner Force," gave some amazing results.
The idea of licking the button of washing in the train, which thousands of others use, can be extremely disgusting, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright talked to doctors and nurses about the increase of intestinal bacteria and its own health.
Fortunately, nothing of the slucky brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for its bowel strength tests, traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public railings at the stations to the button of the toilet bowl wash, this task undoubtedly experienced its immune system
In the film he filmed, he said: "From childhood I was completely carefree about my health and I pulled many different things into the mouth of the earth, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the dirty Russian public toilet.
Its trial ointment demonstrated the value of the luminometer exceeding 4,000 units.
For comparison: the newly washed hands must be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet, which he refused to lick, after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while the newly washed hands show less than 60
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio made a film about a traveler called "The Guide to the Lizun Traveler on the Inner Force," which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the toilet
In the film he said: 'It's close to one of the worst things I smelled in the toilet.'
There's nothing more dirty than it's!
I'm not going to lick anything, because it's disgusting.
"The guide to Lizun's Traveler on the Inner Force" was removed together with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company has provided Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains fermented milk bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help accelerate the growth of human intestinal bacteria and develop the immune system.
Senior Vice President Valio on snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorming that ended with the idea of "Let's call Yanu."
They claim that interest in the health of the intestines becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a greater context: good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is associated with the immune system.
The growing interest in the health of the intestine is a global phenomenon, and with the help of this documentary we were able to present to consumers more information about it in an interesting form.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added: "Let's say this: I would have lost respect for Yan if he had sliced some things I asked, for example, the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.
Naturally, some things for Yanu was easier to lick, and some were quite harsh.
I am glad that some of these vocations we managed to shoot on film.
During a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 percent of respondents associated fermented milk bacteria exclusively with a good condition of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they use at least sometimes products containing added fermented milk bacteria.
The family of hooligans destroyed Saltash, Cornwall Municipal House, on the eve of eviction
The hooligan family left its municipal home with losses of 50,000, after they were evicted for intimidation of their neighbors.
Tanju Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilkoka were expelled from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked officials of housing and construction cooperatives found this property in a state requiring repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the flooring was opened, the garbage was scattered on the floor and the walls were stained with graffiti.
The family is now resettled and is supposed to live in a private apartment
Donna McEvoy, the settler at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid she was not to save him.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I don't think people should live like that.
There are many things to weigh because this property is probably known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys bad fame and their name enjoys bad fame.
The couple had three sons who lived in the property from time to time, and the police reported that the kingdom of terror caused by the family included fights on the street with baseball bats, intimidation of residents of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive cries, disputes and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, received a warrant for anti-social behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, which can be demolished, found old garbage
Floorsuits in the house in which drugs were sold in the past, were pulled out
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from home this week after they were given a prolonged period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The eviction was welcomed by the neighbors, who said that their lives were turned into hell.
One said, 'They didn't care anyone'.
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it has always been bad.
The number of times when we saw the police here is unbelievable.
'This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet - we weren't used to it!
Now that they have finally left, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of Cornwall Housing Neighbourhood Group, said that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and to that regularly called the police
Garbage and old toys were scattered below on the overgrown side of the municipal house
He added: 'This is a shame that the tenant could not take any responsibility for her and her family's behavior, as eviction is always the last method of action that examines Cornwall Housing.
It was a very difficult case, as the behavior was ultimate, and their actions must have been horrible to its observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community who bravely spoke out to give us information.
I hope that this development will give a little consolation to the neighbors and send a signal that asocial behavior will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said that they all then were a little more than 20.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
The resettlement workers will now have to remove the piles of debris that surrounds the house
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 g of hemp, as well as scales, corresponding accessories and 1700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he found himself guilty of possession of class B drugs for delivery.
She said that the money was spent on the gravestone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were made homeless, there is information that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were stained with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say that they will try to evict tenants who do not obey the rules of renting the premises
Angela Crowe, Devon and Cornwall's police, said that this eviction had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they can behave without accusing the accuser, as well as those who are harming such behavior."
Criminal and anti-social behavior will never be allowed by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane almost touched the beach
In the city of Aveira in Portugal, tourists ate to soak in the sun, scaryly afraid for their lives
The P-3C Orion Air Force of Portugal flew incredibly low
The Air Force reported that he was carrying out a training flight, but insisted on the lack of risk for safety
Here is the moment when frightened tourists begin to panic, while the moment when the low-flying plane spoke over the crowded beach.
On dramatic shots you can see a military aircraft flying almost at a distance from the hunters on the sand band in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Vacationers jumped to their feet as soon as they became for obvious reasons concerned about the noise of aircraft engines, but not being able to see that it moves in their direction through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the city of Aveira in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few vacationers who published a video of shocking flight on social networks, said: "He flew quite low twice, and there was a moment, at some point it seemed that he would break."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and swearing, there was such a feeling that the plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on the beach Aveira were terribly frightened when the plane appeared out of the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force today said that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was carrying out a training flight to detect fishing ships at the shore, and was forced to fall so low, as it was the only way to check them.
Pilot said that the plane flew a little lower than usually due to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was subject to danger.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal, as well as took the lives of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made today a statement that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances of thick fog and smog from forest fires that worsened visibility
The aircraft was carrying out a training flight, and the pilot was instructed to detect fishing boats as part of the task
The system "HASSP" for more than a year is required for catering, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Checks become more active, and businesses face fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system has been in the Russian version of HACCP - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for the use by producers and carriers of food, as well as catering companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CU).
Rospotrebnadzor's business inspections for compliance with these norms in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials issue fines only for certain violations of the regulation (see "The list of documents...").
Failure to comply with the regulation as a whole will cost the enterprise 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HACCP as a system that takes into account the risks of working with food and preventing them, invented in the United States in the 1960s.
Then it was about the safety of food for astronauts.
Now the system is used in all food enterprises not only in the United States, but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HACCP operates on the territory of the Customs Union.
The development and implementation of the system of business was 4 years (the requirement of HASSP appeared in the technical regulation of the CU in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard about this norm.
Unfortunately, we were convinced for a long time that the norm concerns only food productions, and not restaurateurs, - said the head of the Public Council Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone is trying to make up for lost.
Expected period of resumption of charter flights to Turkey - the end of August - beginning of September.
But they will not cause an agiotage of demand, as their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts say.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies yesterday sent a letter to the government asking to allow charters.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of choosing a quality and affordable seaside holiday is insoluble, since in the resorts of the Krasnodar region and the Republic of Crimea, most of the accommodation facilities are already booked until the end of September," - noted the authors of the letter and emphasize that the opening of charter transportation in August will not significantly affect the already established demand for the Russian sea tourism.
According to the North-West regional branch of the Russian Union of Travel Industry (PCT), if the aviation agencies of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
Clear understanding when the charters will be resumed, so far there is no, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, aircraft can fly in September, even August, if tour operators quickly build programs and agree with airlines on the necessary on the direction of the boards, "said Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director for Communications and international projects of the North-West regional branch of the PCT.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but will not have a great impact on the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from rest and are preparing for school or spend holidays in other countries.
In the velvet season buy tours mostly single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously, "- says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists, if it now gives a very budget offer - 50-60 thousand rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who purposefully wait for very cheap tours," - says Valery Rozental, CEO of the travel agency Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, rely on the excitement is not worth it - the bulk of travel is already planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that, since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, the charters will also be in demand, but the excitement should not be expected.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters is now a rehearsal of the next season," - says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"The opening of charters to Turkey is positive news for the next season," - agrees Valeria Rubtsova.

The Sultan family said that she married ISIS militant in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reed says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Judge in case of election
The democrat leader in the Senate, Harry Reed, says that he is convinced that the democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate the judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected as president.
Republicans of the Senate blocked Garland's statement, the one that President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The head of the majority group in the Senate Match McConnell says that the next president will choose the person who will be able to replace the last judge of the Supreme Court Antonin Skalia.
Reed said at the conference call on Thursday that he predicts that Clinton would choose Garland "with some degree of confidence."
The representative of Reed later said that he did not speak directly to Clinton whether she would put forward Garland, and simply made assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "sway the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reed said that the Republicans who block the Garland nomination are "privests" and "accomplices" of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said that Trump is not suitable for office.

End-Consumer of Vinyl: Who actually buys records?
Lone solit old men love vinyl.
And until you rushed to clog the section of comments by gross insults under the pseudonym Not All-OdinokhemyMosses, this statement stems from the actual data.
According to YouGov, so much discussed revival of records is due not to a boom among the generation of two thousand who want to penetrate the novelty of the material subject, and nostalgia of middle-aged years.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a high degree of probability are between 45 and 54, according to data.
Moreover, those who belong to the age group of 18-24 years are the least likely.
This is also not just an act of collecting amateurs - this has an emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers with a slightly greater probability keep their feelings in themselves (56 % vs 53 %) and enjoy loneliness (69 % vs. 66 %).
But are YouGov results true?
If this blog were a TV news reportage, the camera would follow me while I would go to the center of the bustling street of Soho, in a modest gray suit and riotously gesticulating before stopping, folding hands and saying something impressive like: "So, let's see.."
So let's see.
While the heart of Soho slowly loses its fascination and dirt hotels, cafes, shops Paperchase now filled the buildings, once occupied by independent sellers - several music stores with fantastic specialists still remained.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene in which I am close to different people in some of these stores and try to evaluate their age and emotional attitude by watching.
Glasgow Stewart, 55 years old, followed by Sister Ray (data counting: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data counting: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20 years old), in London for half aday to hold a meeting, and walks shopping to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
"I suppose yes," he says.
I have about 3000 or 4,000 records.
These records, depicted above (he sent me an e-mail picture, I didn't chase him to the house), go lines along the walls of his living room.
Its reason for purchasing such a huge number of albums and singles is partly derived from his available income: he can now buy records that he could not afford when they just left, and redeem the items he sold when he was young and on the chalk.
"Among what I buy is the end of the 60s, the early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things for which I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are likely to be introverts who like their own company, adding: "I do not smoke, I do not drink a lot.
This is my drawback.
West, 25 years old, who works in Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets correspond to the YouGov profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people under the influence of hype in the media, people who heard about the return and felt the obligation to redeem their old records.
Judging by the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually about 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to redeem their records," he says.
This can explain the boom among the revival of vinyl of a certain age.
And what about the supposed emotional importance of records?
It is enough to spend a few seconds in the store, such as Phonica, to understand that the stores of records offer a comfortable society for people with similar views.
According to Uez, some older clients, in particular, are insulted by a non-cash payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel shocked by the digital world and prefer to retire into the consistity of familiar envelopes for records, items that awaken memories of serene youth.
"I think it can sometimes be filling the emptiness or possession of material things as a kind of calmness," says Wees.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think many people too.
This is an easy way to occupy your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the record rack.
The ICM survey in April showed that almost 50% of people who bought the vinyl album last month have not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41 % has a player they never use, while 7 %, of those who buy vinyl, no record player.
At this stage of the news reportage, I would probably look seriously puzzled, flipping through the rack with the collections of Bosano.
The "Trofe" aspect of revival is what Johnny noticed, 42 years old, who works in Sounds of the Universe (counting data: three middle-aged men).
"Sholy came recently and said, "I have no record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so that we can put it to myself a shelf," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More part of the doss, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They are younger people, not elderly, they are a little less than twenty, who only get acquainted with it.
Fopp, who has now taken almost the entire floor of the vinyl, is much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples who for 70, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above stores - the last time and sexy-pamp Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation, breaks through the columns - it's nice to see the diversity in their customers.
None of them looks particularly lonely, but a painful psychological injury is difficult to set standing for 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleonora, 27 years old, went to Fopp for a few minutes, looking at various records available on sale.
She looks at the goods, not spending money.
She does not earn a lot, according to her, so collecting records is not a very suitable option.
It is expensive.
Listen to music on a computer or other device - just, but the beauty of vinyl is...," - she immerses in dreams of a sigh, crowded with love.
I don't know how to explain it's really unique.
My last stop is a shop that, as they say, contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl lovers: City fashionistas.
While I am creating an illusion that I consider denim tight-minded shorts, I watch a group of teenage girls, every minute going around the Polaroid camera, before his father and daughter start discussing the purchase of the player Crosley.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is placed by records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Flitwood Mack: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory records for any middle collection.
No one looks - perhaps because they are just a decoration, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
This is a real "artistic vinyl."
But given that any attraction of attention to these subjects can mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the province of Soho for a while, almost nothing to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the layer of the population, which is more likely than most has more time and money than most - this is the layer that spends most of the money on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my conclusions show that the results of YouGov are accurate, at least in Soho's records stores, they do not exclude the existence of a huge number of female collectors and lovers of vinyl, which exist in reality, in records stores and online forums.
These people probably work all in school or offices.
But they clearly do not spend the morning of Thursday, strolling through the records on Berwick Street, flipping through the records and avoiding the looks of an unpleasant 30-year-old false presenter, who hung over the shoulders of unsuspecting men of middle age.
Greenlandic Polar shark - the longest-lived vertebrate animal - video message

French Court rejects the proposal to demolish shops in the refugee camp Jungle
The French court rejected the proposal of the authorities of Kale to demolish dozens of home-made shops and restaurants in the Jungli camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At the court hearings this week, the authorities of Kale said that the state should be able to carry a total of 72 home-made stores, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or the simplest dishes for several euros in home-made restaurants.
Kale's prefecture said that these places should be demolished because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitary risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free dishes offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not give enough food for growing numbers in the camp.
They said that home-made shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those who need it.
The court of Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to expel people who were managing 72 home-made stores, but said that the problems of Kale prefecture "was completely clear."
Judge Jean-Fransoua Molla said that groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely shaky conditions."
He said that the spaces provided peaceful points of meeting refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened with demolition was the Jungle Book of the camp, which works for no benefit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes and consultations on asylum for hundreds of vulnerable minors unsusified in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
The letter sent to the Guardian said that its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of which are not older than eight years old."
Two charitable institutions, assisting Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday assessed that the number in the Jungli camp has grown and exceeded 9,000 people - the highest in history - after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Libraries of microdistricts invite young librarians to cognitive programs.
This week, the libraries-branches will hold meetings dedicated to the City Day, the Year of Russian cinema and even the Day of Physical Education.

On Sunday, August 14, for the children from the northern neighborhood library branch number 3 will hold a game program "Fiscult-Hello!."
Britain stops on silver in rugby-7, after the Fiji master class allows them to take gold
The impressive series of Great Britain in Rugby-7 was crushed at the final obstacle Fiji team in the final on Thursday evening, when they were completely defeated 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class on possession of the ball, merging, evasion, support for the game, running lines and rough strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with a not too poor consolation in the form of silver - the third in the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament in Rugby-7, in which on the way won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The painful beating of Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier on the same day, could return to a negative impact on them in the final.
But, despite everything, Fiji in this form won the best team of 15 people.
It may be some consolation for the UK - but probably not that at least one British will hang a gold medal tomorrow on his neck: Fiji's head coach - Ben Ryan, former English chief from Wimbledon.
It was a journey for the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
These blows will cause pain, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji began great, for fun, breaking off the UK's attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like a collis with the column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osa Colinisau dived into the corner.
Having four minutes on the clock Jerrr Tuva added another touchdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and the UK barely touched the ball.
The magnificent attempt to intercept Mitchell kept the man-mountain of Leon Nakara from scoring the third, but it only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner, and the UK lost 17-0.
Nakarava added another after the resumption and on the clock was still more than a minute... in the first half.
Watmo Ravovo then broke through a few more sluggish attempts to intercept the UK and stormed the line to get a point.
The implementation led to 29-0 during the break.
It looked as if Fiji were born to play rugby-7, while the UK is still mastering the craft.
That is largely so.
Great Britain made massive replacements in half of the game, and they blocked the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which according to the standards of the first half was good until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed an attempt for the UK, making a touchdown in the left corner to score 36-7, but the game has long been on the way of the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the stands.
It was impossible not to admire the full joy of Fiji's approach.
Mata William embellished a violian cake, which did not need to be dyed, another attempt in the last seconds.
There was a whistle, the Fijians were omitted, and the UK fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier on the same day, Fiji won Japan 20-5 in its semi-final, and the UK a little bypassed South Africa in a tense semi-final of one attempt to each - the difference of the British implementation.
Kyle Brown brings Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great work of his legs, torn the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept Marcus Watson, brother of 15 in the direction of England, Anthony, provided the victory and ultimately silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the rowing coach with cancer
There will be no more exciting gold on these games, and it says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy climbs in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional value of their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two of them pulling the oars, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of Robin Williams's coach was always there while they sought the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sport, who reached such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, after all, it was their 39th undefeated performance, unprecedented again.
What we see is, two brilliant athletes, sliding over the surface with the elegance of the swans, do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every gold rowed battalion of ready-made hands, contributing gradually increasing victories, which are important, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of the coach, who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know whether he would live to see this day.
As he said, it was a dangerous matter.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of what they can operate and they did it.
If they don't, he's going everywhere.
It could have been a rather bad situation.
It changes your views for the future a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start treatment in early 2014 in the off-season, keeping the gap in the chart minimal if it can be the right expression in circumstances such as these.
I needed to pay, so I had to recover quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the compartment of about 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, though they spoke a few steps.
That's how it starts.
The squire is a journey by itself, but it makes it a little more.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual, in an attempt to overcome their own experiences.
Stanning, captain of the artillery regiment with the service in Afghanistan, said: "I was emotionally ruined this week, maybe it's a bit too much, but that means so much."
This only confirms how much it means to me how much I and Helen worked, and Robin too.
It was a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be no, so thank you very much to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I could not ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
This pair sets a intense rhythm to which their competitors could never match.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were strong in the phase.
Helen called: "stay in the process, stay in the process.
Now it is very important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do something amazing.
We did not wait for fireworks today, we just waited for us to be able to row well and get out and win this race, what we did.
A couple will need a year to solve their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, on her own with the TV claim of adventure Steve Backsholle.
Now she wants to just enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say it was my last race.
This would mean too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I became the Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so better," she said.
Government extends term for the destruction of sanctions products
The government extended the period of destruction of food prohibited for import into Russia by the end of 2017.
The corresponding decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it is published on the official portal of legal information.
Embargo against the countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.

In particular, the ban was meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products.
Food utilization, imported into the country bypassing the embargo, has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
Only in the first quarter of 2016 about 100 tons of prohibited products were confiscated from sale.
Hunting for "prohibition"

The WTO arbitrators panel has established that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil are contrary to the rules of the organization.
The import rates exceed the obligations assumed by Russia when joining the WTO.
"This is the first case when the WTO made a decision against the Russian Federation," the statement reads on the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia's measures "was systematic" or "become a comprehensive nature."
Russia, in turn, promised in the near future to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators.
This is stated in the message of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization on the actions of Russia, which introduced additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the U.S. behavior in resolving disputes in the WTO undermines the principles of discussion adopted in the organization.
Such a statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of the Americans to approve for a second term South Korean judge Chan Son Khwa.
In this regard, Russia will not appeal to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against Russia.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
Now it includes 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
Head of the Presidential Administration has changed
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed former deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Vaino as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin made a reshuffle in the presidential administration and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, during the meeting, Anton Vaino said that he considers the important anti-corruption work, which he began as head of the presidential administration, Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, "Izvestia" wrote that experts consider the situation with Sergei Ivanov's dismissal from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable and reshuffle will not change anything fundamentally in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head, who worked in the presidential administration for a long time, has effectively built the activities of the AP.
Instead came Deputy Head of Administration Anton Vaino - a person who knows the specifics of this work.
In Poland, it is admitted that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The Polish state oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years gas deliveries from Russia may become unattractive for it due to reorientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was announced by Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company Bohuslav Mazhets.
His words are given by TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (Gazprom), we are now diversifying our deliveries.
Within the next four years, the main areas of supply for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway," - said Mazhets.
Gazprom currently occupies a dominant position in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG announced that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas, which is 30% higher than in 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in the purchases of PGNIG increased to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
Recall that on July 22, the antimonopoly department of Poland did not agree to the establishment of a joint venture "Gazprom" and its European partners for the construction of the gas pipeline "North Stream-2."
At the same time, a month earlier, Poland left a request to Gazprom to supply 11 billion cubic meters of gas on the Nord Stream-2.
This was stated by Deputy Chairman of the Holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the capacity of "Nord Stream-2" will be held in 2017, and in the fall of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its installation.
In late May, it was reported that Gazprom has not yet plans to take any actions due to the intentions of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for gas supply from Russia after 2022, said Deputy Chairman of the Management Board Alexander Medvedev.
He reminded that in the first quarter of this year the Poles only increased the purchase of gas from Russia by 42%.
The deputy chairman of Gazprom added that the fact of filing a Polish PGNIG application to the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not mean termination of negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court to reduce the purchase price of Russian gas.
Recall that the authorized government of Poland on gas and energy infrastructure Petr Naimski said that the Polish authorities decided not to extend the contract with "Gazprom" for gas supply.
The contract between Poland and Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish government commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure Petr Naimsky said that his country could abandon the supply of blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
The Nord Stream-2 envisages the construction of two maritime gas pipeline lines with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE special monitoring mission increased the number of observers near the border of Ukraine with Crimea.
This was reported by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine Alexander Khug.
"I can confirm that the number of observers in this field has increased," he said, answering the journalists" question, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, there are no incidents affecting security.
Observers monitored the events at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a passenger plane landing at Ufa airport Yak-42 appeared in the network, which rolled out of the runway by 400 m and fell on the left wing.
The video was published by 360 TV channel.
The emergency occurred at 4.30 Moscow time.
Flight airline "KrasAvia" arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, there were no victims.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport operates as usual.
The Volga Investigation Department on Transport of the TFR began to clarify the reason for the tough landing of the aircraft liner.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in the areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo held by the rebels.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria Stephen de Mistura considers the fact of the incident indisputable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of the inter-Syrian talks, which should begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the terrorist attack using toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
At that time, the opposition said that in the area where the Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before, the aircraft dropped the bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow these accusations were called a drop.
Later, the Russian Defense Ministry accused the opposition group Kharakyat Nur ad-Din al-Zinka of the incident.
Soon it became known that there were two bombs launched with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, the beginning of burning my eyes, it became difficult to breathe," the eyewitness quotes the edition.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people died, 23 were hospitalized.
If the fact of using poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be regarded as a war crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told journalists: "Eleasures that this really happened, a lot."
The inadmissibility of using chlorine for military purposes is prescribed in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Despite the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the "moderate opposition."
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that the shelling of its districts is conducted daily, and terrorists prevent the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to establish a "humanitarian pause" in military operations.
The current regime of daily three-hour calm in the organization is considered "insufficient to help almost 2 million civilians trapped."
The adviser to Staffan de Mistura for Humanitarian Affairs, Jan Egelann, said that a 48-hour ceasefire will be required to deliver assistance and evacuation to the city to deliver assistance and evacuation from there every week.
"We have to send bulk cargoes with a column of trucks in areas where the roads are practically destroyed, and those that remain mined," said Mr. Egelann. "But the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between the U.S. and Russia representatives on the establishment of a "humanitarian pause" continue.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the face of the ongoing battle for Aleppo - the second largest Syrian city - Russia on August 11 announced the introduction of a three-hour cease-fire regime, which will operate daily starting Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is designed to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and basic necessities to the city.
The decision of the Defense Ministry was made against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the demand to curtail the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions in the resorts of Thailand killed four people.
Several explosions thundered in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed, 19 were injured.
The epicenter of explosions fell on the city of Hua-Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four countries, there are no Russians among them.
So far, none of the terrorist groups have taken responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs has hurried to say that the Islamists are not involved in it.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of the organization of explosions.
According to preliminary data of the local police, the scale and peculiarities of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military leaders of the country.
Attacks occurred on popular tourist resorts, including the beach Patong in the area of Phuket and the city of Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat-Tani.
After the arrival of the military junta to power in the country in 2014, the economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, the country has already been visited by 14 million people, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of attacks have already been detained, police colonel Crisan Patanacharoen said.
It is too early to talk about the goals, he added, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the country "sure that they are not connected with international extremist groups."
It's too early to draw conclusions," said Mr. Patanacharoen.
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact, they are local sabotage, and we are trying to identify those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of Queen of Thailand Sikrit.
The Thai junta considers the defense of the monarchy as one of its main priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to the statement of the police general Sichaya Shsshoparonerat, the bombs were exploded remotely with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside the trees on the busy streets filled with tourists dining in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who traded street food.
The other victims are still unknown, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Police of Thailand, among them are four citizens of Germany, three subjects of the Netherlands, two Italian citizens and a citizen of Austria.
There are no Russians among the victims of explosions, the press service of the Federal Tourism Agency reported.
Local experts also attribute the explosions to the August 7 referendum, at which 61.4% of the population supported the draft new constitution.
He was prepared by a commission to draft a constitution, appointed by a military junta.
The voted should have determined whether they support the system in which the upper house of parliament is fully appointed by the military and has a significant role in the election of the Prime Minister of the country.
The new system was adopted and tested for the first time at the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall, May 22, 2014 in Thailand there was a military coup led by the commander of the army of the country Prayut Chan-Ocha.
According to him, the army was motivated by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military established the National Council of Peace and Order, introduced a curfew and censorship, dispersed protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok was in an emergency
The Thai government headed by Prime Minister Yinglak Chinavat in January 2014 announced the introduction of a state of emergency in Bangkok and adjacent to the capital provinces.
A special regime lasted 60 days.
As in Bangkok there were two explosions.
In January 2014 in the center of Bangkok at the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, there were two explosions, as a result of which 28 people were injured, five of them were in critical condition.
The explosions produced unknown on motorcycles.
The authorities have strengthened security measures in the capital and attracted military forces to protect demonstrators.
In the Dry Log began the development of conditions.
As it became known, the government was invited to agree on the draft auction terms for the Dry Log gold deposit with the preservation of two key restrictions.
It is proposed to prevent companies, where 25% and more belongs to foreigners, and those applicants, whose capital will not be at least 25% of state participation.
Industry participants do not expect that the government will repey the terms, noting that many players do not risk taking up a difficult and expensive project.
The auction may be announced in August, and held in October.
The Ministry of Nature submitted to the government a draft order and terms of the auction to the largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia Dry Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), told two sources "K" familiar with the situation.
The project was introduced on Wednesday evening, one of them clarifies.
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project was submitted to the government.
Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin, a representative of the supervising subsoil use, said that the project has not yet been submitted to the official's staff.
"The auction can be announced in August, immediately after the government's order is released, and taking into account the deadline for the applications of potential participants (at least 45 days) the tender can be held in October," the Ministry of Nature says.
According to "K" data, the project retained two key requirements to potential participants, prescribed in the version, which was sent for approval to the ministries and FOIV in July (there is "Sh").
The first is the presence of no less than 25% of state participation in the capital of applicants.
The second is the refusal to access the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on foreign investments in strategic societies.
According to the two articles of the Federal Law, as already written by "I" on August 2, the auction may not allow companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, as the Dry Log refers to the subsoil of federal importance (the reserves of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project "will contain restrictions on the admission of foreign companies," but refused to comment on the details before the government's order.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the auction participants was put forward by the Irkutsk region, said in December 2015, "K" in the Ministry of Nature and later confirmed Governor of the region Sergei Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by its predecessor Sergei Yeroschenko, "have an agreement on investment projects with Rostec."
Who lobbied the restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interlocutors "K" do not specify.
"But this is in the spirit of time: not to give control in the largest gold deposit in Russia against the background of Western sanctions," says the interlocutor, familiar with the preparation of the auction.
On August 1, Minister of Nature Sergei Donskoy said that foreigners "can go to a consortium" if the applicants attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners."
The interlocutors of "K" believe it unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for the Dry Log in the industry is considered a consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation, PJSC "Polyus," controlled by the son of Suleyman Kerimov Saidu, and "Rostekha."
As Kommersant wrote, in July the partners created a JV "SOL Gold," where Polyus has 51% of shares, the structure of "Rostekh" RT-GR - 49%.
Rostekh refused to comment, and said Kommersant that "it is certainly interested in this asset" and possesses all the necessary competencies and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the terms," - added in the "Polyus."
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision behind the government of the Russian Federation, said sources "K."
The possibility of participation in the development of the Dry Log was announced by the Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which develops assets in Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to the data of "I," are not interested in the asset.
Head of the Union of Gold Industry of the Russian Federation Sergey Kashuba in December 2015 estimated "I" investment in the Dry Log of $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants scare not only the volume of investments, but also the complexity of the project: serious inventory and technology of working with complex ores are needed, the interlocutors of "I" in the industry explain.
The largest M&A transaction - KIT Finance Pension Administrator launched the pension market.
As a result, on the basis of the "Gazfond of Pension Savings" the pension fund with the volume of savings of about 373 billion rubles will be created.
On the launch of the procedure for combining four pension funds - "KIT Finance," "Promagrofond," "Heritie" and "Gazfond Pension Savings" - yesterday said the owner of 100% of the funds of LLC "KIT Finance Pension Administrator."
"The reorganization is carried out in coordination with the Central Bank, while observing the requirements of non-ruterior conditions of existing contracts," the company said.
The association is carried out on the basis of the "Gasfond of Pension Savings."
According to General Director of this pension fund Oleg Byaloshitsky, the merger of funds allows to solve several problems: expanding the geography of presence, concentration of resources for development, reduction of costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimization of corporate governance.
According to him, the approximate deadline for the completion of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the pension fund "Gazfond Pension Savings" will become the largest player in the market of the FPS.
According to the data as of March 31, the volume of pension savings of the merged funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the reporting on the fund website, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through the LLC controlled by the LLC owns 65%) and NPF "Gazfond" (35%).
However, the unification of the group itself has launched much later competitors.
Thus, the NPF controlled by O1 group "Fuel" absorbed the "Stalfond" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this joint pension fund is joining Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
Nikolai Sidorov, general director of the Future pension fund, notes: "Unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, it is necessary to solve structural problems."
Active work on consolidation of funds from April is carried out in the pension group "Safmar" - NPF "European," "Education and Science" and "Region Fund" should join the pension fund "Safmar" until the end of this year.
In 2017, they will be joined by the pension fund "Trust."
"The mergers of funds will give the effect of increasing control over risks, operating processes and expenditures," - noted in the pension group "Safmar."
A pause in the merger of funds, which was withstood by the "KIT Finance Pension Administrator," can be caused by several reasons, according to experts.
Until recently, the pension funds could not buy more than 40% of the issue of infrastructural bonds, which were actively placed by the group.
After the amendments were made to the Central Bank's decision in March this year, there are no such restrictions on a number of issuers that meet the regulatory requirements.
If necessary, the entire issue can be bought by one major player," - says the director of the group of ratings of financial institutions of AKRA Yuri Nogin.
Several leaders of the NPF from the top 15 on assets are another possible cause of the pause and, as a consequence, personnel appointments in a single fund, which were to be harmonized by the group's owners.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comments.
The request of "K" in the NPF "Gazfond" also did not respond.
Although the consolidation of funds is a laborious and expensive event, this decision will be justified at a long distance.
According to Sergei Okolsnov, general director of the consulting company Pension Partner, the Pension Savings Fund has fewer outflows, joining will stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, a more successful experience of NPF "KIT Finance" and "Promagrofond" in the construction of retail sales of the FPS, as well as the use of more modern software will be in demand.
The requirements of the Central Bank for the processes and personnel of the pension fund are constantly growing, so it is not advisable to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director for Corporate Ratings of Expert RA.
"The effect of reducing duplicate functions will definitely overrrow the possible costs of unification," Mitrofanov notes.
The cost of combining four funds by Sergei Okolsnov estimates 30-50 million rubles.
"The expenditures on the maintenance of four funds of such size are about 400 million rubles a year, while the consolidation in the medium term, the budget is really halved," says Mr. Okolsnov.
The Russian rental has come the most kind Disney movie "Pit and his dragon."
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the slander dragon, the soul-to-peer history and the songs in the country style are enough to believe again in the old-fashioned magic, believes ELENA KRAVTSUN.
A frightened baby picked up a dragon, who became a human baby and a gentle baby, and a devoted friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of the puppy from the book of fairy tales, plays with him in erupt and falls asleep in the embrace.
Six years later, he, who had fallen in and in a hip bandage, is no longer distinguished from another clever forest torn-bee - Maugli.
In this form, Pita discovers the red-haired woman-herr Grace (Brys Dallas Howard), while the Gavin Brigade (Karl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively rolls the forest.
Now she will have to not only believe in the existence of the dragon, but also to help him save.
Pete undergoes an accelerated course of "to be a man" surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear carpet shirts, moral code in the heart and smile more dazzling than in any advertising.
No character looks and does not act too horrible, so that the viewer really began to hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who opened the hunt for an atypical inhabitant of the forests under his control, is far from the incorrect villain.
A huge fluffy dragon also turned out to be not terrible, with a good snout bulldog, an airliner span of the wing and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon urinably urinably, murmurs, even frowns, and, fortunately, does not say, but he all the time wants to stroke, this he favorably differs from all known cinematic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner of staying provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments begin to weep desperately in three streams not only small spectators, but also adults.
Amazingly good and little-year-old Ouch Figli in the role of Pita, breaking between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuoso gives out canonical grandfather, who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Louri shoot a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten Disney film "Drcon Pita" in 1977, mediocre from the nose to the tip of the tail and remembered only the mix of animation and game cinema, and make it the most soulful film of this summer?
No other way than the miracle helped.
In his picture of Louri from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan of Pita and the dragon.
Behind the board remained musical numbers and most of the strange jokes.
In this good fairy tale are read the features borrowed from "Bambi," "Inoplanetian" and many other lovely hearts of children's paintings.
Disney continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remayer of the 21st century.
Of course, "Pit and the Dragon" is not as stunningly beautiful as the same "The Jungle Book," and there is no skillful villain in it, as Keit Blanchett was in the role of a stepmother in the new "Golden."
But this naive film no less successfully helps to believe in miracles and goodness in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys of the magical castle of Disney director Louri will receive again - for the artistic adaptation of the story of "Pitera Pan."
Drafted in the "Pit and his dragon" tandem David Louri and scriptwriter Toby Halbrowks entered a new ambitious project about an unadven boy on the fairy tale of the same name James Barry.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov to be charged with new charges
Lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, charged with organizing the activities of an extremist structure, said that the prosecutor's office found deficiencies in the case of their defendant.
The fact that the prosecutor's office brought such a presentation, we learned from the investigators just yesterday.
We planned to participate in the court hearing on the restriction of acquaintance with the materials of the criminal case, but the session was not finally held, and the investigators reported to us about the presentation issued by the Prosecutor's Office," RBC quotes lawyer Olga Dinza.
She said that the prosecutor's office pointed the investigators to the inconsistency of the case qualifications and collected materials.
Now the investigators will have to eliminate gaps in the evidence base and present a new accusation to Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CC) will appear in the case, or will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinse points out.
As reported by Kommersant, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June this year it was reported that the investigation excluded the wording of "disrutaing the political situation towards instability" and "the overthrow of the authorities illegally."
The correspondent of "Kommersantboscosport" ALEXANDR ZILBERT lived the life of the Olympian in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian national team, had dinner in the local dining room and even passed the WADA test.
It seems that life here does not die for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end in midnight, after which athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, without stopping is being inhabited and eviction from the village, as some athletes complete their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only arrive here.
Well, at 7:30 am at one of the temporary shades stretched heads of all Olympic delegations.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational household issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house, which housed our, consider, exemplary - it was put into operation one of the first and demonstrated to all the inquistandings, even in it there are some shortcomings.
Then with hot water problems, then, sorry, with toilets.
We struggled for purity for a long time.
At first, just no one came to get out.
Then wedges began to come, but only popiked some substance on the floor, and that's all.
They have, you see, some innovative.
They say they can't be washed humanly.
Yes, we know these floors - laminate is ordinary!
In general, we have achieved a change of cleaning company and now with this all OK.
The Olympic village - is such a South Butovo, a sleeping area, fenced on the one hand mountains, with others - an impressive ditw, sometimes flooded with water.
And for reliability there is still a two-meter perimeter of the iron fence, along which automatons walk.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17 thousand people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is completely given to the needs of our team.
Looking at the small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems, apparently, are the most pressing for the domestic team.
At the reception there are two ads: printed "Pleasure, do not throw the paper into the toilet!" and by hand "I'll receive the bad bad.
The counter itself is drowned in the booklets.
Their cheerful color contrasts with the titles of the brochures: "Memory on infectious diseases for traveling to Rio de Janeiro," "First aid in drowning, ingress of a foreign body in the respiratory tract, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiac and pulmonary resuscitation," "First assistance for burns, heat shock, fractures and bleeding."
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example, this: "Infecting is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, not everyone is waiting for a favorable outcome.
Of course, in the location of the Russian national team there is a medical center, which at any time is ready to provide home residents with qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massage.
Opposite the medical center - the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door - an inspiring poster "Despite anything, we will win!."
And, of course, verses:
All arguments are absolute delirium!
They are believed only by those who fear.
Let us less, the taste of victories, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for even greater upliftment of the spirit hangs an ad: "Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of His Holiness Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill spiritual care about the athletes of the Russian Olympic team is carried out by Archpriest Andrey Vladimirovich Alekseev.
You can order a prayer service and other trebs by phone...
In general, there is a Center for Meditation and Religious rites on the territory of the village for representatives of all denominations.
But the Russians, it turns out, in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the load of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to be used during the fire.
And in the darkness he stumbled on the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of a new cleaning company.
I believe that in readiness at any moment to rush on the washing of innovative floors, they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor I was waiting for a meeting with a long-time acquaintance - Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our trampoline players, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and the pupil, European champion Jana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
To complain by and large is not what, - says the honored coach of Russia. - Live two, beds, of course, almost stand in the butt, but it is not critical.
The bathroom is one on four, but spacious.
The cabinet, of course, funny, of fabric, does not cause trust, but things can be put.
"No, well, you throw, the tea is over!" - spreads the hands of tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, met me in the main dining room.
The main it is called at least because it is a space of 2.7 thousand square meters and is ready to receive at the same time 5 thousand visitors.
Here they issue on-mountain 60 thousand portions per day completely free.
The menu options are: "Best from Brazil," "Kukhni World," "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta."
The last option, as I sleek, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, say, soups I did not find any of the branches of the giant restaurant.
"What soups?" wonders Kuznetsova. "It's not a time!
It's good that I took Chinese with me, weaned.
And the kettle.
But in general, so that you understand, we have food on our courts even worse.
Here at least something can be chosen, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose a cod for a couple and meatballs in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish is a plate with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as indicating the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, it was quite, to admit, it was edible.
I do not even understand why this queue is all the time in the local McDonald's.
The satisfied, relaxed, we can say "warm" athletes at the exit from the restaurant waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They lure cleverly - a quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
They provoke, we can say!
To get a gift, it is necessary to answer at least eight questions out of ten.
There are questions in Russian! - a girl from WADA attacked me.
But it was not attacked.
That is, I am in a patriotic impulse to get in, of course.
The situation aggravated already on the second question: "If I received a notice of passing the doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?"
I stopped at the version B: "No - I have one hour."
I lost, so to speak, vigilance.
Forgot that WADA has no concessions to wait.
In general, it is necessary to appear immediately.
But at the seventh stage of the quiz, my position became quite critical.
For some reason I thought that if it would be difficult for me to observe a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and, by the way, it's hard for me!), then I can use bio-additives to get "additional nutrients to enhance my productivity."
Ah no, do not allow!
More precisely, the answer is formulated so that they do not categorically forbid, but insistently, in several sentences are disscured.
It's WADA playing dishonestly!
Well, how are they, Russia? - bullying asks the leading quiz.
There is nowhere to retreat - behind Efimov, Isinbayeva and all our bleeding team.
So I concentrated and from the last strength won the unfortunate T-shirt.
Know, as they say, ours!
In a victorious mood, I stunned to the fitness center next door.
He became interested in counting simulators.
He fell by 250.
He noted with surprise that in this heal of treadmills was not found any Russian athlete.
But maybe it's right?
Let the one who does not know how to play is training!
But in the nearby polyclinic one of our boyfriend was sitting.
In line to the oculist.
Don't worry, not a Rifleman.
In the clinic, however, as well as throughout the village, wherever the spit, hangs a device for issuing condoms.
It is inspiring insulting invocation: "Hang up with a condom!"
Next, it remains only to cool the iron, resembling the handle of the door lock, and the condom made of natural latex Amazonia, is readily released from the apparatus.
I took one, in memory.
From the athletes will not stay - they brought them 450 thousand.
Just for the festive and idle time in the Olympic village there is a whole entertainment center.
Near him just in case is a cognitive plaque, reminding that the International Olympic Committee in various ways spends on athletes $3.25 million per day.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices, similar to video exercisers.
This is what is it? - I am interested in a comrade in the form of a Ukrainian team, which actively uses a strange toy.
I could, of course, just say that he does not want to talk to a man in the form of a national team of Russia, and that's all.
Here, by the way, by some strange coincidence of circumstances in the eyes of the guys in chewed in a chewed-blakitny.
The most playing team, it turns out.
To bypass the whole village, looking into each corner, you need at least three hours.
But, if you walk, and not ride electric cars, you will open and the house of the Canadian team with a lose at the entrance and tent with a restor bath, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and dry cleaning, and hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with goods of everyday consumption, and mail with unique brands (only you still can not wait for the line of Chinese and fins, and photo-shops.
And late in the evening you, deceased, sit down near the olive tree, hung with colorful ribbons in memory of friends and relatives of athletes who left this world.
And you will be under the accompaniment of the machine, randomly spraying liquid for the killing of insects, to think about the eternal.
That is, about the Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world held breathlessly watched, as the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, real fans went to the network.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in the rapier at the XXXI Olympic Games, I got the first.
Maybe I'm even the only Muscovite who saw how it happened - not counting those, of course, who watched the competition in Carioca that evening.
This can only be understood by a real fan.
Imagine: a deaf Moscow night.
The neighbors from below - as always by one o'clock in the morning - wake up and begin to sound without sound, but shout at each other very loudly.
And threatening to move the furniture.
The kitchen is a crane - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as requested plumber, new.
In the TV timetable, nothing is clear, so he simply kept on control the channels "Match," "First" and just in case "Russia" - although it is almost pointless.
"Russia" is the birthplace of repetitions, the whole sport there for some reason is recorded.
There TV series live broadcast.
Hope, of course, at the Match - a whole evening the young man shouted in newscasts first about the great semifinals of Deriglazov--Shanayev, then about the coming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead basketball is the USA-Australia.
By the way, I can't say anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were on equal terms, the first half generally won.
They put the Americans in the place of the ofigued from their own greatness.
As a result, they still lost, but, as they now say, the basketball Olympic tournament will not be the same.
That's all good, but the battle with Di Francis is coming, and there is no change on the screen.
In a light panic I start to flip channels.
It feels like it, the second time in a row.
Well, let's go deep into the cable.
There is no fencing on any of the thematic "Matchy."
And, according to my feelings, the battle is about to begin.
Text and tweets of some sports sites are not satisfied with me.
Surfing gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the website of the First, it turns out, there is a live technical broadcast of all competitions, which are held at this moment of time.
I will fencing, get a fight for gold.
Deriglazova perfectly counterattacks, goes ahead on points - and obviously begins to pull time.
The Italian woman wins almost the entire gap.
Our one point ahead, to the end a little more than two seconds.
Di Franchica rushes to Deriglazov, it retreats, time ends, the Italian strikes an injection.
Victory!
After a couple of seconds, the Olympic messenger on the phone reports the fourth gold medal.
Comes out, I'm the first to see it with my own eyes.
Insane, faithful, involved.
The Spiritual Administration of Muslims (Mum) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the plenary session of the DUM obliged its imams to conduct Friday sermons only in Tatar, to make young Tatars "to learn their native language."
The management states that this "in no way infringes" the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques Kazan complain that the Tatar language does not understand up to 60% of parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
Imams fear that their sermons in the Tatar "will not reach the whole audience."
Yesterday, the plenary session of the Tatarstan DUM unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in mosques of the republic only in the Tatar language.
According to Mufti of Tatarstan Kamil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to "learn their native language."
"For those who say that it is "heavy," in every big mosque we intend to organize lessons of the Tatar language for free," Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that "the decision has already come into force" and today in all mosques the sermon "should be already in the Tatar language."
He recalled that the Duma of Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Shur" with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
Imam, who speaks Tatar well insufficiently, "may prepare for them thoroughly."
The Tatarstan DUM unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to Mufti, in the districts of Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, in a number of mosques previously used predominantly Russian language.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev mosque, Zakabannaya and Eniler.
However, Mukhametshin stressed that the leadership sets the task for all students to speak both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no question of any infringement of the Muslim-netatar," said Mr. Mukhametshin, explaining that the sermon itself "is not a mandatory, the main part of the namaz."
At the same time, the namaz itself will still be read in Arabic, in mosques there will be lectures and lessons in Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin said that there was no serious threat of expulsion of the Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar other languages, for example, Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in preaching in the republic.
The decision of the DUM was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT).
Head of the Executive Committee of VKT Rinat Zakirov said: "Mecheti is an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language had left this sphere.
He noted that the conduct of sermons only in the Tatar language "desir of imams themselves," but in the executive committee of the VCT " consider this correct."
The imams, who preached in Russian, are ready to fulfill the decision of the DUM, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulties with understanding the clergy.
The mosque is both Tatars and Russians.
Many people do not understand the language.
They, of course, will be tight.
"We've had to rebuild," says Farhat Mavletdinov, Imam of the Burnaev Mosque.
According to him, the Russian language's sermons are closer to many Tatars, since "Russian and in schools, and in kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere initially."
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We rely on Allah.
Allah will show a way out of this situation," he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot goes to us foreign students: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we have passed to the Russian language for four years," says the imam.
He believes that in the Tatar language the sermons will "reach a narrower circle and will not reach the whole audience."
But we will obey the decision of the plenum.
Just the result of the sermons will be different.
But time will show.
"For example, it will only be easier for me, because the Tatar language is my native," Gabdulla Galiullin concluded.
Former director of the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) was sued
The Moscow Prosecutor's Office approved the indictment on the criminal case under the investigation of theft of budgetary funds allocated for the needs of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia.
Former head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused the FSIN damage in the amount of more than 2.7 billion rubles, will appear before the court.

Yegor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
"I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, which cost 2-3 times less than for films of foreign production," he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for the audience with large Hollywood films.
In our country, more than 100 paintings are made per year, of which 20-25 tapes reach the screens.
"And even they are very difficult to compete with "Transformers" and "Iron Man," in the promotion of which huge budgets are pumped," - said the film director.
Recall, July 1 in the Crimea began the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum "Tavrida."
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian directions from all over Russia and a number of countries of near and far abroad.

Konstantin Akukich, lawyer of former vice-governor Nikolai Sandakov, was detained in Miass (Chelyabinsk region).
According to "Yuzhnyi Ural" another lawyer of the defendant - Sergei Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akuchich today called to the investigative department of the TFR Miass to charge in the case of a year ago about the strike.
Then Konstantin Akulych went to the place of an accident as a lawyer to help one of his participants.

The Russian copper company (RMC) is ready to take social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMK took up the modernization of one of the oldest and most environmentally "dirty" enterprises of the country - the Karabash copper smelter.
The Karabash copper smelting plant was founded by the English Joint Stock Company led by Leslie Urquaart in 1910.
In Soviet times, this was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually provided vital activity of the whole city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, which caused serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabash copper smelter.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabash plant - environmental.
By the early 2000s Karabash was already infamous as an ecological disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedia began to change in 2004, after the company was transferred to the management of the Russian copper company.
The company began to modernize production, which began to gradually reduce the environmental burden on the environment.
Governor of the Chelyabinsk region Boris Dubrovsky recently noted this, who visited Karabashmed in early July.
The head of the South Urals called the changes that have taken place with the enterprise since the "Karabashmed" moved to the group of RMK.
The main event on modernization of "Karabashmedia" in recent years was the construction of a new sulfuric acid plant that allows to catch up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the president of the Russian copper company Vsevolod Levin, the volume of investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of CJSC "Karabashmed" is the reconstruction of the convertible redistribution.
The replacement of three converters, dusters, gas pipeline route is planned at the end of 2017.
The cost of the project - 2.5 billion rubles.

WSJ: The United States is considering the introduction of sanctions against Russia due to the breach of the Democrats" servers.
U.S. officials are considering the introduction of new sanctions against Russia in response to the breach of the Democratic Party's servers, writes The Wall Street Journal citing sources.
It is reported that in order to impose sanctions, the US President Barack Obama will have to officially accuse the hackers of attacking the servers of Russia or supported by the Russian authorities.
According to sources, the FBI and other American special services are practically confident of Russia's involvement in cyber attack.
WSJ notes that usually the United States prefer not to specify by name those who carry out hacker attacks.
The exception is the breach of the database of Sony Entertainment Pictures, which was officially assigned to the DPRK in 2014.
However, last year Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for introducing sanctions against those who carry out or promote cyber-attacks.
Initially it was directed against China, but can be used against other countries.
The process of making a decision on sanctions may be prolonged, the newspaper writes.
Even if the officials came to the conclusion that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, before making a decision on disclosure of information, they will have to weigh the possible consequences.
They have to determine whether the incident is so serious that it is to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was reported that the Obama administration allows the use of sanctions against the state, whose hackers have hacked the servers of the National Committee of the Democratic Party.
WikiLeaks published an electronic correspondence of the National Committee of Democrats.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities may be involved in hacking.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.

The effect of "Animates" Snapchat is criticized as a caricature for Asians
Snapchat says this filter is inspired by an anime, but some observers say it's racially tactless.
With the Linzy tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change the reality and play with individuality in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into pineapple, dog or character to catch up with the picture of Roy Liechtenstein.
The lenses are rough, twisting features of instruments that create more than 30 million corrected selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become generally known.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the application's dark facial skin or encouraged bleached faces as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users this week offered a lens, which gave them slant eyes, crooked teeth and plump cheeks, some critics considered this racist caricature on Asians - "yellow-faced."
And they wondered if these repetitive contradictions indicate a more serious problem of the company related to diversity.
On Wednesday, messages were spread and the following indignation in the reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat announced that they had removed the function.
The company commented: the lens was conceived as a respect to the characters of anime, and not as a caricature of Asians.
But experts who know about racism firsthand, the lens recalled insulting stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with anime.
In an e-mail, Grace Spapani, a Korean-American student of art, whose tweet was actively shared about the photos, said that the lens was "sorry and at least embarrassing."
She added that "it is hard to argue with the comparison side by side of a very rough caricature on Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow-faced, but highly humrially yellowic.
Snapchat is not the only company passing through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, ranging from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat - who are more racially diverse than their older generation - can mean that they are more likely to wait for understanding.
When one of the lenses Snapchat creates an image insulting to the user, then, said in an interview on Thursday 25-year-old Katie Zhu, "it's much harder to go unnoticed as it used to be."
On Thursday, the production manager and the engineer, who works on Medium, decided to delete his account in Snapchat and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview she said that racial contradictions are the reason for insufficient diversity when recruiting shots in Snepchatka.
Juu criticized predominantly the white management of the company, consisting only of men and finished her article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu wrote, who is an American of Chinese origin: "Either they have not had enough unwhite people in the state who could make such decisions, or they have non-white people, but they do not occupy positions that can be safely and openly expressed."
Other observers share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction with the fact that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information about the presence of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of its personnel, but according to the trustee, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on insufficiently represented segments of the population and active attempts to involve internal resources.
For her part, Zhu said that she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us so that they can say that it wouldn't go."
Military leadership distorted intelligence about ISIS, the Congress Commission reports
Officials from the Central Command of the U.S. Armed Forces have changed intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic Emirate in Iraq and Syria, which is the reason for the events on the spot, the Congress Commission reported on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group, established by the Republican Chairman of the Committee of the House of Representatives for the Affairs of the Supreme Court, the Committee for Intelligence and Subcommittee on Military Assignments, found a "widely widespread dissatisfaction" among analysts of the Central Command intelligence service, who claim that the leaders have corrected their assessments of American actions aimed at the victory over the Islamic State.
The central command, known as the Centkom, is the main military administration in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The reconnaissance documents, approved by the top command of the Centkom, as a rule, gave a more optimistic image of the US anti-terrorist actions, which is confirmed by real data from the scene, and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence services," the newscast, dedicated to the report.
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when the top leadership is unreliable analysis, our military suffer," said Ken Calvert, a member of the House of Representatives, a Republican from California.
Problems with the leadership in Centcoma reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report examines the shortcomings that have constantly arisen in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the armed forces of Iraq, provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain final evidence that members of the Obama administration ordered to falsify reports, he claims that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership forced them to pose a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic Emirate, also known as ISIL or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony of the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than the real events," the report reported.
For example, the Centkom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul may begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic Emirate.
"After months of investigation, it is certain," said a member of the House of Representatives Mike Pompeyo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest leadership of the US Central Command intelligence service forgery was counterfeiting the intelligence documents of the command to reduce the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created an operational group when they learned that analysts expressed concern that the intelligence about the Islamic Emirate was falsified.
As the investigation progressed, the report published on Thursday will follow more unfolded data.
Additional, unfinished investigation of the informational data Center is conducted by the chief inspector of the Defense Ministry.
Representatives of the Democratic Party of the House of Representatives of the US Congress published their own data on Thursday, which agree with some of the conclusions of the republican operational group.
"By 2014 and 2015, the Centkom created an overly closed procedure for producing intelligence assessments regarding ISIS and Iraqi security forces," says Adam B. Schiff, member of the House of Representatives, the main representative of the Democratic Party in the committee.
This procedure, according to Schiff, "susipated the release of intelligence documents," caused damage to the morale of analysts and "insufficiently reflects the divaous views."
But Schiff and the Democrats claim that they did not find evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to "a given or political interpretation."
The preliminary results of the Congress investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation into the Pentagon's chief inspector, opened after the complaints of Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant-commander Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defense will not comment on the report of the Congress, while the investigation of the chief inspector continues.
But he said that "experts sometimes differ in the interpretation of complex data, and the special services and the Defense Ministry welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics relating to national security."
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the target of the US bombing in Iraq and Syria (as now claims more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defense).
But last year's statements make doubt whether President Obama can rely on the fact that the Central Command provides truthful assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of the intelligence of the Islamic Emirate repeats the disputes that took place more than ten years ago, when the Centkom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article stating that the administration of President George Woker Bush, because of the protest of many analysts, supported a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think that it would follow the invasion of 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence in the Islamic Emirate.
Last year, according to officials, Hooker's team came to the conclusion that despite public statements about the opposite, airstrikes at the re-transfer refineries belonging to the Islamic State did not lead to a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group, because it built temporary refineries to sell oil in the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside the Central Command, as the Times reported in September.
The then commander of the Centcom, General Lloyd G. Austin III, was criticized last year after the testimony in the Senate, which many deputies considered an excessively optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at the Central Command of Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. wins 4 times in a row in the women's grass hockey, thereby approaching the decisive fight with Britain
Having scored three goals in the match, which ended with a victory over Japan with a score of 6-1, Kathy Bam opened the scoring on Thursday with the first two goals for the US women's grass hockey team, when the Americans defeated India with a score of 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27 years old, says she is not sure if she would once do something like that.
"I will not do my Uma," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who track their goals.
That's what she knows: the score of the Americans 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains invincible after the loss of Japan with a score of 2-0 on Thursday.
The teams of Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams claim the quarterfinals, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams, and who - the second.
The winner will avoid a strong team of rivals from Holland, the leaders of another group, a little time when the games of the quarterfinals will begin.
However, Saturday's game shows that the Americans here made a noise of their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was in that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time took a club for hockey on the grass when she was 3 (its older twin sisters played this sport in Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she did not qualify for the final team.
Then came 2012, when everything did not get well with her and her teammates.
Next year, Koeig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training," said Bam.
In London, we did not have the same performance that is now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half of the game with an inconvenient hand at a short distance.
India approached the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative in its hands.
She made a long pass with the ball down the left side of the field, then on the spiral went into the middle and sharply sent the ball into the goal, thereby giving the Americans the advantage of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The victory of the "dry" was the first in the tournament for the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three victories.
She's in a blow.
Like Bam.
"We are in a good position right now," Parnham said, but how good it depends on the result of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the fury of the Olympic Games - ed.e. jumps on the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how much time it is now, it is the Olympics.
Events in Rio de Janeiro seem unchanged and inevitable, it is a mad combination of competition and aspiration.
Like the Olympic flame itself is the burning torch, which is passed from archer to swimmer, to gymnast, to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in turn in the cafe and do not hear about Simone Byles, Katie Ledeki or about the hostility between Michael Felps and Chad de Clo.
And there is Logan Douly.
Dolls, for the first time participating in the Olympic Games, a hottie with pit on the cheeks, could well be among those celebrities, which are shown in prime time, which are promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencing.
But 28-year-old Dolly from Lake Forest in California is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline jumping competitions.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all events in the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are those sports that are not recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, long reigning him.
But if I am allowed to timidly speak out in defense of my personal addiction, allow you to pay attention to the modest charm of jumps on the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jumps have been Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the games in Sydney, over the past 16 years they received so little recognition that many people surveyed by me were not aware that they generally belong to Olympic sports.
It can be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in the trampoline jump, and their athletes did not reach the final until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually share male awards, and the Chinese and Canadians - women.
Dun Dong from China and Rose McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But jumps on the trampoline have an outsider, in particular because for the unenlightened ear is more associated with the circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I must admit that I am not an expert, but only a landed enthusiast.
They really have a comic potential - this caricature flash of endless jumps - but also the elegance of gymnastics and jumps into the water, two sports, which they mainly combine.
The word "battle" comes from the Spanish word "elpol tram'n," meaning "a jump to the water."
The contenders jump on a giant trampoline, taking off into the air almost 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends and salto) until the final landing on the feet.
They are evaluated by execution, complexity and "time of flight," according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
The applicants for the medal should go further, faster, higher and higher in the chase of gold, sometimes to the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, here and there on the field.
They strive not only to the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in sight of the cameras, to another distinguisher frontier: the world or the Olympic record.
This persistent aspiration is noble, worthy of admiration, even fanatically, and it is enough to make even the spectator weave.
But it, in my opinion, is somewhat tired when watching the Games.
From it jumps on the trampoline give a respite.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, it seems weightless, like astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And in them, of course, is not without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program there is no insane zeal to the finish line, there are no jumps in length, only a wonderful, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
This is the closest to the Zen Olympic sport.
Women's qualifying competitions, and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast in an hour of Eastern European time day; men's - on Saturday, also an hour.
NBC will broadcast the finals within the day program starting from 14:00 to both days.
In the midst of the Olympic insanity is expected to be calm, a wonderful moment that can be easily seen in the common landfill.
And if the growth of consciousness can be achieved only by exposing male athletes to the coherent views and objectifications, as, according to the Wall Street Journal, recently suggested male hymennasts from the United States, "Duly only waits for its new admired crowd of fans.
"Generation protests" in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
The fierce protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced a violent confrontation on the part of the government.
Eyewitnesses say that dozens of protesters were deadly wounded during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of splitting?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid Western ally with a rapidly developing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shocked the country, extending to an increasing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people went out into the streets, demanding radical political changes.
According to the human rights defenders, the government's reaction was severe.
Eyewitnesses claimed that police officers shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video recordings from the protests, presumably filmed at the end of the past or earlier this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they put their hands on the wall.
The higher official of the United Nations Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country from disintegration, and it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the project "African Rog" in the international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country of Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services closely cooperate with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia develops at an impressive speed.
Its infrastructure has significantly improved - there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy - human rights organizations constantly mention government repressions - the opposition in the territory of the state was stopped, due to the fact that dissidents actually silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or driven into remote deserts.
But it may change.
"If people are constantly suppressed and do not leave them other options except to protest, the uprising will rise," said Seim Tesome, lecturer of the University in central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation protests.
Complaints are numerous, ranging from land use, ending with the seizure of power by the government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the governmental party and its allies completely displaced the opposition and now control the 100% of the Parliament.
At the same time, the tension along the Eritrea border is growing; the struggle for this indefinite, controversial boundary has taken hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, which have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogagen National Liberation Front, may try to use the excitement and re-eating.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, boiling in the depths of their hearts for several years, are now flare up.
The first, it would seem, completely harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years, a large number of Ethiopians were able to communicate in social networks, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace, and the Internet service has become better.
Even when the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they organized for protests.
The second is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, Amhara from predominantly Christian alpine areas of Ethiopia flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of which are Muslims and live in lowlands.
But it also changes.
"We will act together under a single principle," said Mulata Hemem, the leader of Oromo.
The biggest protests took place in the districts of Amhara and Oromo.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that members of the Tygrai ethnic group, which is about 6% of the population, who controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics, are unjustly dominated in Ethiopia.
The third reason for the excitement is the loss of Meles Zenaoui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, up to his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts argue that he particularly skillfully recognized the first signals of dissatisfaction and used scouts to obtain data and neutralize opponents.
"The current regime lacks common sense," said Abdi, an analyst with conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Haylemariam Desalen, appeared nowhere and took the place of Melesa.
Unlike Meles, which was native to the Tygrai region in northern Ethiopia, Haylemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by Tygrai.
Many fear that as a result it will lead to even more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what, as analysts said, apparently, was the elections that the government had constipationed, and then forged the results.
In the course of subsequent repression, many Protestants were killed, although in less numbers compared to the last months, and this period of unrest was relatively fast.
Development experts thanked the leaders of Ethiopia for the long-sighted development of infrastructure, such as a new long-distance train and significant success in the fight against poverty.
But it is obvious that this did not stop the growth of internal dissatisfaction with the government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, the city in Amhara, attacked enterprises belonging to Tygrai, and anti-Tygras hatred in social networks becomes comprehensive.
Analysts say that protesters put the United States and other Western allies in an avenging situation.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently announced that it has closed this base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, he does not want his ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
"And on this strained rope it will be difficult to pass," - said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama, "sarkazm"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress the last conflict that covered his election headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when several times this week he declared that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic Emirate.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the candidate for president from the Republican Party to appeal wisely to the American people.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during the period of unrest, in an awkward situation, as they had to explain the statements that he probably did not mean.
Having expressed this assumption at the congress on Wednesday evening, Trump resolutely insisted on his statement on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton founded Daesh.
But on Twitter post early in the morning on Friday, Trump wrote that just ichidin.
This post was a direct opposite of the statement made just a day earlier, when Trump said in a few interviews that he was absolutely serious in his accusation.
When the conservative radio host Hugh Huitt tried to help Trump soften the statement, reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the presidential candidate from the Republican Party did not take advantage of the opportunity.
The last scandal broke out when Trump tried to redirect his campaign to the economy amid the downgrade of the rating.
Trump and Clinton made competing speeches about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried again to return to this topic.
Again, when he resorted to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would increase the taxes, and said that his speech was boring.
Trump has already used sarckaz as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he took upon himself a general criticism, practically expressing the idea that the Russians should hack Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his remarks, saying, "Of course, I'm joking."
This approach allows Trump to go beyond the limits of the permissible in political speech and take his words back if necessary.
"I think this is his way to test certain messages that are responsive among his fans to watch how they act, and then "explain" them in one direction or another, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, an expert in communication, who conducted an analysis of the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to interpret them in different ways.
Instead of softening statements for the general electorate, Trump took an even more caustic tone in recent days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that Trump is inferior to Clinton with a great margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and goes with it aligned in Florida.
Although Trump tends not to apologize for the provocative things that he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding of his sense of humor.
But since Trump has become the object of increased attention in the past months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward situation: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, who is one of Trump's most famous deputies, has made a serious effort to protect the candidate in an interview given by CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," said Giuliani when he was asked about Trump's credibility that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic Emirate.
This is true in the sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown Mali-Lenist organization, he called it not a threat, absolutely unfair, and that's why everything happened because he took the troops out of Iraq.
Most of the average Republicans assure that the Obama administration, in which Clinton was the Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to develop, as it failed to settle the situation in the Middle East.
Before the rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for the deterrence of each of his words and bias against him.
He mocked the "poor miserable" television experts who are trying to solve it, and said, "They are weak!"
Some democrats ridiculed Trump's justification as an additional confirmation that he was not fit for president.
Once a displaced coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
The Verb coffee shop was shabby, taking only cash in Williamsberg, where there was no Wi-Fi, but served a good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was driven out of her room with a showcase on Bedford Avenue.
The shop "Soup Sheri," which took the place "Verb" in the summer of 2014, is engaged in the sale of soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in the renewing city.
The artist Molly Krabapp wrote on Twitter: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb has now become a soap shop."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it, in turn, is updated.
The reborn Werb coffee house opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
In the new "Verbe" there is Wi-Fi and accept credit cards, but there are some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
In addition, coffee is still good.
The new "Verba" is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old coffee shop, which is the owner and general manager in a new place.
He started working in the "Verb" in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients proposed to sponsor it in a new place, he said that he would be happy to go to it.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, left a lot in its former form.
"Verb" works with the same distributor of the bases and bought the same model of a coffee machine.
It even has chandeliers from the old "Verba."
But Rodriguez said that he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu includes sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese, and there are toppings of capers or fried onions.
There are dishes of brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now freshly squeezed juices are prepared.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said that he drew attention to the constant flow of old loyal customers.
"Many former customers were also squeeating out prices from Williamsberg," he said.
In one of the recent Sundays Rebecca Oliveira was one of such clients.
Oliveira, who was 34 years old, used to live in Williamsberg and often visited the "Verb."
Even after she moved to Green Point, she still went there.
After the closure of Verba, she said she had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was coffee and atmosphere that impressed me in the "Verb," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although that day, instead of the usual ais-coons, she ordered a blended tea, another novelty.
Tom Rozental, another long-time client, has been faithfully visiting Verb since 2003.
He went in front of his work and ordered invariably the same thing.
"In the fifteen minutes of the eighth, every day, as in the clock, I came, and for me I was cooked with oil and with all the fillings," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes in the menu.
Today Rozental still makes an ordinary order, but someday he will change something with bacon, eggs or cheese on a basele with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said he was not in resent for the fact that the store had once taken possession of the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Sheri offered to make a special soap for "Verba," using coffee made in a cold way, as an ingredient.
"I think we may agree to their proposal," said Rodriguez.
Permanent residents of Green Point of Polish origin also chosen this coffee shop.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he plans to find a place for him in the window so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has other benefits.
The local point for the sale of juices plans to pour on bottles and sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will join the adjacent building.
For many customers it is enough that the new "Verb" will include their favorite dishes in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client and shared that he was killed by grief when they closed.
When the coffee house opened in a new place, Whitth said that when he entered and ordering a cup of coffee, he felt like he had returned home.
"How long ago I wanted to feel this aroma," he admitted.
Depressive food of depression in the "Plot meal"
In March 1933, shortly after the ascent of the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down in the Oval Cabinet.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved the fashionable dishes of Fifth Avenue, for example, foie gras and Meriland skulled soup.
His menu on this day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert - pudding made of prunes.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband Andrew Cove added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are specialists in food history.
The last book of Cohuas, "Rague in Chinese," was devoted to Chinese cuisine in America, and Ziegelman told the story of life in a filmed apartment in Lower East Side through food in her book "House 97 on the street Fruit Garden."
Their new joint work "Fresh meal," which will be published on Tuesday by Harper - a story of American food in the Great Depression.
Having appeared to some extent their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny simple snack in the Fletayron quarter, which has been working since 1929, the year of the Exchange collapse.
Zygelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and sandwiches with olive pieces, and Cou, 57, took turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered the meat roll, the pair considered this a suitable starting point for the discussion about food in the era of depression.
"The sulateds were in great demand," said Zigelman.
There was a peanut roll, oven roulette, legume roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed to stretch the ingredient.
Imagine eating as much peanut as you need for dinner.
Cove was fringe.
"He probably was lying in the stomach with a stone," he said.
In the years before Depression, the American table, especially in the countryside, was a buffet.
Women's groups cooked for men-workers of the farm, and freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans during the First World War. "Fallenary meal" describes how the country coped with the fact that suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for the Americans," said Cove, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The same difficult was a new budget diet: mysterious dishes, such as rolls and camps, became the main food; cedar is a "excelling way to dispose of velding," - noted Zigelman, - because the chef could hide the non-appetite ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruits have been replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which has been the basis of American food for many years, has become sparingly distributed luxury.
People tried strange mixtures, because energy and nutritious value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While studying for the book, which includes recipes, Zigelman prepared a dish of that era: peeled onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"This addition to the dining table was not successful," said Cove.
Zygelman added, "It was very strange."
The oil of the leaching does not come to the onion at all.
This was typical for many house-dive recipes.
As never before, and ever since, householding specialists - including Louisa Stanley, the head of the Federal Office for Housekeeping from 1923 to 1943 - managed the food habits of the country.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "compliers of the budget," to accept the challenge and transform the bourgeus like rubbish spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
"Fresh meal" is a feast of curious historical facts.
The stories about the government's reaction to the hungry citizens are especially piquant, for example, President Herbert Hoover's position in the spirit of "let the pies eat."
Publicly evodging the simple farming stream of the state of Iowa in the time of his childhood, he fed like a sophisticated millionaire who became.
"It liked continental cuisine, for example, fish with cucumber sauce," - said Cove.
He ate almost in a gilded dining room, putting on the tux.
He was fantastically cut off from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to give an example of her own stomach.
As stated in the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a economist who was absolutely uninterested in taste, and this led to the fact that the White House "used not only the most dull food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly prepared."
Many of the culinary receptions of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got to its feet again.
Their heritage is our constant focus on calories and nutritional, says Ziegelman, and how science was used in cooking.
Spouses say that during the writing of the book, they better understood the food habits of the mother Zigelman - that she could not throw food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of careless attitude to food," said Cove.
Zygelman recalls: "She seriously poisoned people."
There was one unpleasant case with the profiles.
When the plates at Eisenberg's empties, they got a dessert with Cou, which was prepared at home: a dessert made of prunes, which President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"This is called a moss made of prunes," said Zigelman, adding that it was a common reception - to give modest recipes catchy names.
There were no crammed cream, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All with reluctance plunged the spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
To be surprised, it was not bad.

The second pension indexation for 2016 may be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on August 12 by Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have specific parameters, as far as it is necessary to increase the pension in order to lower the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
Now economists sum up the half-year, and we will complete this work in the next two or three weeks," - quotes Golodets "Interfax."
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the head of the Strategic Developments Center Alexey Kudrin to increase the retirement age for six months every year, Deputy Prime Minister said that this topic is not considered in the Cabinet.
At the end of July it became known that the Government agreed on the position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.

Turkish oppositionist Fethullah Gulen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of an attempted coup d"état in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt," the French newspaper Le Monde quotes Gulen.
The Turkish opposition also said that "if at least some of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen denies involvement in the coup d'etat in every way, stressing that his organization never claimed political power.
The court of Istanbul had previously arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gyulen in absentia.
Recall that the attempt of military coup took place in Turkey on the night of July 15 to 16.
Gilead will reimburse the costs of legal services during the dispute for the hepatitis C patent with Merck
The company Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to reimburse the costs of legal services, which it has in due to a dispute over the patent for a medicine from hepatitis C with the drug manufacturer Merck &amp; Co Inc, the federal district judge, decreed.
In June, Gilead was released from the payment of 200 million dollars of damage for the infringement of two patents of Merck related to Gilead medicines, the leaders of sales, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the American judge discovered a number of violations by Merck, including lies under swearing and other unethical actions.
When appealing to court on Thursday, the U.S. Federal District Court judge Bet Lebson Freeman said that the company Gilead has the right to reimburse the costs in the course of the dispute.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when the companies Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to the laboratory work, which is based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead's medicines.
The armed forces created with the support of the United States claim to have intercepted full control of the Manbidge from the Islamic Emirate
The armed forces, created with the support of the United States, seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last militants of the Islamic Emirate left in the city, said the representative of the group on Friday.
The Syrian democratic forces are now purging the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They liberated more than 2,000 civilian hostages, which were held by the militants, Sharfan Darvis told Reuters from the military council allied with the SDS of Manbija.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are making clearing operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of federal tax rates
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published her tax declarations for 2015, which showed that the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in fees for performances, and the former Secretary of State announced the revenue of $3 million from Simon &amp; Schuster for her book on her stay in the State Department.
Potential Vice President of Clinton, US Senator Tim Cain from Virginia, together with his wife Anna Holton, published tax declarations for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillari Clinton and Tim Kane continue to establish a standard of financial transparency," said Clinton's advisor Jennifer Palmieri in a statement.
In full contrast to them, Donald Trump hides behind fake excuses and violates his past promises to publish his tax declarations.
This is a common thing for presidential candidates - to publish their tax declarations, although the law does not require them.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the inspection of the State Tax Service as the reason for his refusal to publish their tax declarations.
"Your move," Clinton's adviser to Clinton's electoral staff, Jan Sams, wrote on Twitter, referring to the declarations of the Democratic Party candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's special adviser Michael Cohen said CNN that he would not let Trump release them until the end of the checks.
Trump's critics, including the Republican Party presidential candidate in 2012 Mitt Romney and other Republican fellows, said that his refusal raises questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including Russia.
Clinton grabbed for this issue and on Friday released an online video in which the main place was given to outstanding Republicans, who persuaded Trump to publish tax reporting.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during a speech about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done without exception for decades: to publish his tax declarations," she said to the audience.
The newspaper Politico reported that Trump did not pay any or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the business observer of the New York Times newspaper on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants who believe that it may be so.
The federal tax rates have become a subject of dispute in the presidential election.
Clinton supported the rule named after the billionaire, investor Warren Buffett, who would guarantee that people receiving more than 1 million dollars a year will pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, in Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, offered Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he is also under the IRS check, and that Trump "fams" not the tax collection agency, but voters.
Clinton's electoral headquarters published tax declarations until 2007.
Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, in New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective aggregate tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
Clinton's declaration for 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only for $100 out of their income was the source of wages.
Their main investment was the inexpensive index share fund, and Clintons announced dividends and capital income of 109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks enhance the protection of Tanzanih elephants
Environmental protection fighters in Tanzania use an unconventional way to prevent elephants from wandering into the settlements - throw condoms filled with chili powder.
The method proved to be effective, and the organization of the Honeyguide Foundation, which came to this idea a few years ago, together with the American Committee for the Protection of Nature took over its promotion, teaching volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use non-violent, consisting of four steps, a way to protect their homes and soots, without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to protect themselves.
On Friday there will be a World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of animals.
"Since we invented a set of tools ... we have seen a change in the relationship within these communities, as a result of which they are much more confident that they will be able to prevent elephants from entering their fields without harming elephants," said the executive director of Honeyguide, Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps are in the lighting of the torch before the broken border elephant and signals with the help of horns.
If it is not possible to scare away, then throw the so-called "cloud of chili."
The chili powder, mixed with the soil, is placed with a flap in a condom, and its end is twisted, only a wick remains outside.
When igniting the condom bursts with a crash, spraying fine chili powder dust in the air.
One blow is usually enough to turn the elephant to the other side.
The extreme measure is the launcher that shoots with Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
32 Turkish diplomats have not yet returned to Turkey, who left the country after the coup attempt in July this year.
Such data was cited by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Chavushoglu in an interview with local journalists.
In the first stage we recalled 208 personnel diplomats to continue working in the center.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations," the head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.
Recall that in July in Turkey there was an attempt of coup d"état.
The authorities of the country officially announced that the coup d'etat failed, as well as reported the detention of more than six thousand people, including military ranks of the top and middle level.
As a result of the coup attempt, 290 people were killed, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey.
The Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for the removal of the Israeli telephone code at the "re request" of the Arabs - reported channel RT News
French Jewish director unleashed a scandal in the media, discovering that the hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin does not have on the list of the phone code of Israel, and the employees refer to the "reserves" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzman, author of the documentary about the Holocaust "Shoa," expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel Lanzman tried to find Israel in the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the countries where you can call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, Israel is excluded and eradicated?
He wrote Lanzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to dial Israel through its own telephone service center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this question at the reception of the hotel administration.
The answer he received there, according to Lanzman, "shocked him."
The hotel's clerk said that this measure was "a thought-on decision by the management of the hotel chain Kempinski."
The reason behind this step caused even greater anger of the director.
"Modern of our guests are Arabs, and they have demanded that the code of Israel be removed," said Lanzman, serving the hotel.
Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case "terrified shame," - reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's really a terrible shame.
What happened in Germany and it is in this network of hotels, even more shame.
Explanations are not necessary here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," the official said.
The case caused a considerable resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the hotel Kempinski simply "relied on" the alleged requirements of Arab customers.
"It would be shamed," - it was said in another post, where it was pointed out that the hotel, located on the glorious street Kurfurstendamm, is next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself hurried to resign any accusations, calling the incident "inspection" and "pologize" to Lanzman, the newspaper Der Spiegel reports.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the list of a quick set," - quotes the words of the representative of the hotel Kempinski newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code is now added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students faced the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest against government reforms of the system of state education.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
Disorders began when police tried to disperse students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the State of Sao Paulo, almost 100 state secondary schools will be closed, and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some protesters could be seen behind the writings on the walls of graffiti directed against interim President Michael Temer.
This last protest took place only a few days after the protesters massively came out into the streets to support President Dilma Roussef, who was suspended, when the Senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 % - RT Business portal reports
With the abolition of sanctions, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is an increase in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies resume ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to 856 million dollars.
In particular, the Russian export to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to 158 million dollars.
The increase in trade was achieved thanks to the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the Ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that this year Russia will visit a record number of Iranian tourists.
Last year, the diplomatic mission of Russia in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mainly tourist, to the citizens of Iran.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries by the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year's record for the number of Iranian tourists who visited Russia will be beaten," he said.
At the same time, relatively a few Russians visit Iran, which, hopes the ambassador, will change.
"I personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yd, in which the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition," he said.
The state continues to tighten the nuts in the military-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the "systematic failure" of the instructions of the General Director of the Almaz-Antey Concern, "missing in work" and "loss of trust."
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed the head of NGOs for the next three years.
Information about Neskorodov's dismissal appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause wide resonance in the media.
How to explain such silence in the conditions of large-scale re-equipment of the army?
Most likely, the Russian leadership does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This once again confirms that the military-industrial complex has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from society to them.
The removal of Nesconrodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of restoring order in the industry.
Almaz is the head enterprise of the concern, which specializes in the production of marine and ground-based anti-aircraft missile systems (SAMs).
Currently, "Almaz" is working on the creation of the AA missile system "Polyment-Radut" and "Morfei," which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruiser.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is caused by the failure of deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of "Morphea" began in 2007, and commissioning was planned in 2013.
Polyment-Redut should become the main air defense system on the newest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I received, in a few years of testing no truly successful test was committed.
However, as far as I can judge, this is not a clear fault of "Almaz," - said Kornev.
The expert fears that the delay in commissioning may occur with the S-500 air defense missile system.
Experimentally and design work on the project has not been completed yet, but in 2016 the first complexes should enter the troops.
The Defense Ministry assures that "the work is being carried out planned and everything will be completed within the established timeframe," although in 2014 the Ministry recognized the presence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who headed the "Almaz" since 2011.
Kornev stated that the failure of the terms of the projects can be both a reason and the reason for dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to extract information about internal processes in the FOC and plans of enterprise management.
The industry received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and, as you know, a lot of money is loved by silence.
As a rule, the directors of defense companies leave their positions at their own will, under the agreement on the agreement of the parties or transferred to another job.
In this case, the dismissal took place publicly, although it did not receive resonance.
This suggests that the leader of the Almaza was probably a slant figure and resisted the "disorders" descending from above.
Apparently, the state no longer intends to put up with such behavior.
It will dismiss those who prefer to argue with the Defense Ministry's settings and do not fulfill their tasks.
At the same time, the Russian leadership seeks to punish the aforgious managers (the fraud on the shipyard "Zvezda").
The president personally pays great attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings dedicated to re-arming.
The Kremlin defends the ranks of the FOC managers, trying to have at hand the loyal composition of directors, which will comply with the orders received from above.
This is far from an ideal policy, but the state has no other tools against the background of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the FOC.
Of course, the current situation in the defense industry is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation encourages the Kremlin to put the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of managers in the military industrial complex, the Russian leadership is taking quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The personnel of the Armed Forces has acquired a new quality with the arrival of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the president has taken the well-known saying "You want peace - prepare for war."
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which secured the Moscow sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the disadvantages of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
The evidence of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The celebration of the "winners" in the Cold War eventually turned into the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world," perhaps, there is not a single quiet corner left.
Despite the common trouble, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such circumstances, the only allies of our country remain the fleet and the army.
The strengthening of military power will allow Moscow to defend its national interests more effectively and reach new frontiers of world politics.
Scotsman Callum Skinner races in the finish line, as a result of which the British capture bicycle gold
Scotsman Callum Skinner was triumphing in the men's team sprint on the velodrome in Rio last night, as a result of which the British team trio defended its title from London in 2012.
Glasgow, a 23-year-old native, was the strongest one his friend, Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy, made his own, and the young man proudly entered the story, slamging the finish line to win the victory from a favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain declared the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoi declared the right to fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick, after they finished modestly sixth at the March World Championships in track cycling in London, despite the fact that Hoi since then finished his career.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of a specialist member Jamie Staff.
They did so just at the time when Hindes appeared.
Hoi's departure also created the emptiness that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was followed by British coaches, seeing the potential in Scotland, which was now realized.
Hingdes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualification, but the standard was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hinges was definitely behind after his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
Changing the strategy was a great part of the transformation where Hindes rode on a greater transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and, especially, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoi watched from his seat as an invited BBC expert and caught the look of Skinner, Kenny and Hindez when they entered the podium.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "This is a flattering comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was unbelievable.
There is no better way to win.
After the triumph in London in 2012 along with Kenny and Hoi, Hindez admitted intentionally fell on the track after an unsuccessful start.
He later renounced the comment, and there was no way to appeal from the UK's competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hingdes said, "I felt like in London, with all those flags of Great Britain at the stands."
We all met as a team in the last three months.
We lost on so many world-renowned races that winning the Olympiad again was amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country, which won seven out of 10 titles of races in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the velodrome is waiting for another five successful days.
With the form demonstrated by Kenny, it is not beyond the opportunity to imagine how he repeats the feat of Hoi, winning three Olympic gold medals in one of the Games.
This would make it possible to see Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoi, who was also born on March 23 (it seems a sacred date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farach and Roger Bannister) - bringing his score to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be as well as with Hoy.
The next time Kenny competes in the sprint, which begins today and will be played for three days.
28-year-old native of Bolton said, "I just enjoy it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
A little alone to win alone, to be honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must get a knighthood."
It was the only one for the day of the draw of medals, but there were further good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Berk and Owen Dull are qualified for the fastest four-kilometer team pursuit of four.
They finished for 3:51.943.
The world record set at the winning gold in London 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 pm) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the Commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying arrival, when officials demanded him to measure his weight.
In the appropriate women's event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Johanna Roosell Schand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milgawi improved the world record, showing the time 4:13.260.
Team UK came to what relies on a mighty team of cyclists to take ownership of the average period of the Olympic Games and earn a bunch of medals.
After actually exceptional demonstrations of full superiority in Beijing and London, expectations weakened in gradual preparation for Rio.
There were dramas in the background, not the last - resignation from the position of technical director Shein Sutton in April due to accusations of sexism and oppression, and the departures of large figures such as Hoi and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the race of the first evening on the velodrome, it seems that the legendary glory of the UK in reaching the tops at the right time, perhaps just repeat again.
The future of the Portland Metallurgical Plant is threatened by the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland Aluminum Plant in Victoria and the workplaces of hundreds of workers are threatened by the fact that the electric power company, which supplies the plant, according to one of the owners of the plant, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This step is a consequence of the decision made earlier this year by the Government of Victoria, not to extend the subsidies provided to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs can be threatened at Alcoa's plant in Portland.
As many as 2,000 jobs directly and indirectly can be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect consequences, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgical plant in Pointh Henry, which led to the shutdown of the power plant in Engles last year.
Portland Metallurgical Plant Alcoa loses money and risks closing.
These actions resulted in reflections on the future of the plant, which have been going on for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later - due to the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant to Latoro-Valley, said it expects the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlling share of the plant is owned by the joint short-term company Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese company Marubeni Corp owns smaller shares.
"AGL expects the portend facility to continue to operate, that is, that physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop," she said.
According to AGL, these contracts are so-called 'hedge contracts" that were to come into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month period of termination, so in fact they will end in 2017.
"Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to bring its part of the income in 2017 financial year," said the electric power company.
Whatever the potential impact on AGL's profits since 2018 is currently limited by forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said that it has already reduced the amount of contracts in its reporting by 187 million dollars in view of the "pre-prevention."
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alco's ability to manage the metallurgical plant or to provide electricity supply to the metallurgical plant."
The American company said that in 2010 she signed a twenty-year contract with Loy Yang, which was to come into force in November this year, but it still has to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland Metallurgical Plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavorable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, the head of the operation service of AGL Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annually uses about 600 megawatts of energy, and Tomago - about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant decrease in demand in the market [electrical energy].
For us, as for the manufacturer, it will be bad," he said.
Not only the star reality show Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September issue Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20 years old, model and fourth daughter of the clan Kardashian-Jenner of the mother-manager Chris, appeared on the coherent September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the brand Estee Lauder and defiled at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
"I was in the room with my favorite people, I looked at the cover and wept," Kendall wrote.
The news about the cover was accompanied by strange (or simply in the spirit of the "Family of Kardashian?"), prepared reality-video, in which the whole family of Kardashian-Jenner (deboshire Rob and Keitlin, also joined them by the most beloved uncle of show business, producer of the "Family Kardashian Ryan Sisrest), and they have forgotten the evening in the evening.
This is the standard storyline of almost all episodes of children's TV shows dedicated to the birthday (the cross utters the phrase: "Did you think we've forgotten about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the program at 8 am), but Chris needed this fame anyway to get to other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of Kardashian show.
Let the eldest sister Kendall Kim get on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
September issue is the most selling Vogue release for the year.
Tolshchina similar to a gift edition rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the portal Fashionista, 615 pages from last year's 832-page issue contained advertising).
The news of who the stars will get on his cover are expected to be so eagerly that in the last two years the photos of the magazine have been fed up to the official announcement.
Among the previous women caught on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover, of course, has been presented more "celebrity that work models" than "models that are celebrities."
The winner of the Oscar award and the face of the Dior brand Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the cover in 2013, a year after this honor fell to Lady Gaga.
But even in that unlikely case, if Jenner, whom the magazine described as an "existing model" of its generation, falls into the first category, it is in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, stars of reality show or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner gets into all these categories).
They are really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyonce, which appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful in his career in connection with the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, because of her past star of television reality show, was always shaky.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Jiji Hadid, calling them "the pieces of the moment."
These moods again drilled after the news of the appearance of Jenner on the cover of Vogue.
But there is no point in closing on dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
It is a supermodel in all senses of the word.
She defiles for Mark Jacobs.
It sells you a tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own applications available on a paid subscription.
She sells her own photographed daughter Cindy Crawford to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, it is possible to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she participates in reality shows on television.
Public legal centers refuse to serve 160,000 people a year
Every year more than 160,000 least defended populations refuse to serve in public legal centres, as this sector is preparing for the effect that will further cut the funding to and the activities that are already at the limit.
In Queensland, three out of five people are mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who are not able to fight unjust deprivation of property, and so on have already been refused, trying to get free legal assistance and representation.
Public legal services, already working outside of possibilities, are preparing for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centers should lose another 30% of federal funding.
Director of the Queensland Public Law Centers, James Farrell, said that according to the report of the latest census of the National Association of Public Legal Centers, thousands of people have been refused a year.
Farrell said that if the decision of the federal government is not annulled, the situation will only worsen.
"The public legal centers of Queensland constantly receive insufficient funding: it means that thousands of people are denied vital services necessary to them," he said.
People who are out of violent relations, people with uncontrollable and desolate debts, families passing through divorce, unjustly dismissed workers, all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent since June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected residents of Queensland will be forced to solve complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis immediately to annul these funding cuts so that people can get the necessary help when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise the financing of free legal aid to the average in the country.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centers and communities, their clients, and the Government of Palaschuk it is time to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's electoral staff sued after an employee, as stated, threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's electoral staff was sued: it is said that the headquarters did not do anything after the announcement that his operating director in North Carolina threatened an employee with a pistol when they rode in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday at the State Court in Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor in the electoral headquarters of the state.
Bordini said that he had been waiting for a few months to solve the problem in the internal order, but he realized that "it would not happen."
Director Erl Phillip "recovered the pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and directed the barrel on the Vincent's knee cup," says Bordini in the complaint.
Having complained to the local and regional administration of the electoral staff, Bordini realized that at least four more people became participants in similar incidents with Phillip, the appeal states.
"Pistoles do not have to shoot to inflict damage," said Bordini in the complaint.
The claim took place only two days after the presidential candidate from the Republican Party made a furor, telling the listeners in North Carolina that the "people of the Second Amendment" - understood as the owners of weapons and his fans can act if his rival Hillary Clinton will be elected and will be able to choose judges.
Trump's electoral staff said that the media had withdrawed his words from the context, and that he did not speak out in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the electoral staff for careless control, and Phillip for the threat of physical violence, insulting action and moral harm.
Trump's representative Hope Hicks slows with the answer to the request to give a comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip were not successful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, said that Phillip had recently left the electoral staff.
In response to the call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one quickly called back.
Presidential candidate from the Republican Party Donald Trump held a controversial campaign.

Britain should direct the Olympic spirit into the right direction and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring rebirth and prosperity not only in our localities and in general in London, but throughout the country as well.
As for me, it was exactly that the huge advantage of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to make our nationalities and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games have brought great benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we will do this again, creating opportunities for local residents and firms near Heathrow.
Only for our localities alone we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to the youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain will never be ready for the Olympic Games, and that we would find ourselves in a difficult situation in the world arena.
Skeptics were mistaken in 2012, and they will be proved to be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games Heathrow - an infrastructural project for the majority, not just for a narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a program of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investments in a timely and within the budget, from T5 - elected by the best terminal of the airport for five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the two most occupied runways in the world.
Now they are ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The Olympic Games in London 2012 was a great success for the UK, and I am sure that the expansion of Heathrow will also be.
It is time for us to direct the Olympic spirit to the right direction and expand Histrow, ensuring our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton - Chairman of the Council Heathrow and the Former Trade Attaché Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing " cat-mouse" on the issue of blocking advertising
For companies that make money on Internet advertising, attempts to bypass advertising software are a game of "mouse cats," according to one of the companies that create such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced that it is going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus published a blog post that users can update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site will change the box around its advertising, so that ad blockers become more difficult to recognize which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now states that it was able to bypass the new code.
In his blog post, Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "s that "s that kind of mutual struggle between the community of open source ad blockers and those who are trying to bypass it, continues from the moment of the invention of blocking advertising," and it is possible that Facebook will present its own decision in the near future.
The fact that the world's largest social network has entered the fight is a clear sign of how big the advertising blockers for the industry have become.
All over the world, about 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to last year's research Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times the number of those who used such software in 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion daily active users who come to Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now makes 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenues.
However, the company hunts ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in mobile applications Facebook for social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
But still advertising in the desktop version is a fairly profitable article to Facebook to consider such a step profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it is going to update its tool "advertising preferences" to provide people with more control over how they are targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook said that the new Adblock filters are of concern as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people and we plan to solve this problem," Facebook representative said in an official e-mail.
Advertising blockers are a rough tool, so we instead focused on creating tools such as Advertising preferences to transfer control into people's hands.
The woman moved on the Swiss autostrade in an episode of obvious suicide
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police call on witnesses after a woman moved several vehicles on the highway early on Thursday morning in an obvious attempt of suicide.
The incident occurred on A1 near Morge in the canton of Wo immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and she was hit by several vehicles, the police said in a statement.
Apparly trying to kill themselves, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49 years, hit several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several introcertained drivers have already been questioned, but some people have not yet been identified, reported the police, who calls them and someone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was opened, a "logical" step in such a situation, said lawyer Gilles Hofstter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is yet to be found out whether someone involved drivers will make accusations.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
That's what the prosecutor must determine," Hofestetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be recognized as responsible.
In each case, both of which involve a person walking in the dark on the highway - a verdict was issued that motorists can not expect a random meeting with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, the officer was acquitted from inflicting death on negligence, after she hit and killed a man lying on A1 near Payern at night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim saw and lost consciousness on the road, listened to the court.
The court found that the female policeman who responded to an emergency call - managed the vehicle in a way that was justified, and that the presence of a person on the road was "perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who owns information about the incident on Thursday near Morj, should call the police 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climatic model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have been inhabited once, according to estimates of the new climatic model of NASA.
Scientists from the Usov Institute for Space Studies Goddard developed a model for the study of the past Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether it could, with its hot waterless surface and the atmosphere oversaturated with carbon dioxide, there are some conditions similar to those of the earth.
Scientists previously assumed that the small speed of the rotation of Venus was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the last modeling suggests that Venus could probably have a tense atmosphere like the earthly, and still spin slowly.
The model also considered the topography of early Venus.
On the planet, in all likelihood, there were more arid regions than on Earth, but once there was enough water and a geographical enough smanage to create conditions for life and to prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited the sun, which was 30 percent dim.
"According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus substitutes for the sun for almost two months in one time," explained Anthony Del Henio, a GISS scientist in a press release.
This warms the surface of the planet and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds acting as an umbrella that protects the surface of the planet from a significant part of the solar heat.
The result is the average climatic temperatures, which, surprisingly, are somewhat colder than nowadays on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development, which was previously assumed by specialists in the study of planets.
Despite the fact that Venus may have been inhabited, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen flirtered, only the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly greenhouse effect remained, that is, Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaves the post of coach of Avalanche team
Patrick Roy left the post of coach and vice-president of the hockey activities of Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the decision-making process in the team.
Executive Vice President / Chief Executive Officer of the Colorado Team Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"During the last three years, I have been acting as head coach and vice-president of the hockey activity of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said Roy 50-year-old in a statement.
During the summer, I thought long and diligently about how I could improve this team to give her the depth necessary and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice-president of hockey activities should perfectly coincide with the vision of the organization.
It should also have the right to vote when making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions are not met at the moment.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs of the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced a score of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points behind the Wild team in the fight for the second discount trip to participate in the Western Conference.
Goalkeeper from the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups - two with Montreal Canadiens and with Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume negotiations and suspend strikes
Work strikes on the issue of oil workers' wages in the North Sea have been suspended, and all sides of the discussion are beginning to a new round of negotiations, the leading representatives of the parties said.
Strikes against the oil service company Wood Group were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea, run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume negotiations to resolve current disputes," the joint statement reads.
We will hold several full-day meetings for the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of the next week to look at the problems with a fresh look.
The trade unions reported that their recent action, which, according to them, was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential wage cuts up to 30 percent.
This year Wood Group reduced the rates paid by contract servicemen operating in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to the negative market tensions.
The company's interest rates declined after a 10-percent reduction in interest rates for contract servicemen operating on the shore in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions will give it space necessary to overcome the decline of the market.
Shell, for its part, reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in the countries to 10, as it rationalizes its activities due to its mega-merging with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower prices of unsheed oil: the economic situation has deteriorated due to the decision to withdraw from the European Union, adopted in June by the UK.
The Scottish member of the Parliament, Dev Anderson, met with the trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour conflicts that arose in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that would work for the majority, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion of new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to the average value of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speeds of the Star in the Pleiade cluster
The last space telescope mission of Kepler helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational velocities of the stars included in the Pleiad cluster.
New data help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how the rotation periods correlate with the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Louisa Riball, a researcher at the Center for Californian Technology Institute in a press service.
The Pleiad accumulation is located in 445 light years from the Earth.
Many stars in the cluster now only reach maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They rotate as fast as ever will no longer.
At their peak speeds these adult stars throw out large amounts of star wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds have a hindrance effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots such as sun spots.
The latest catalogue of speeds of rotation makes us assume that more massive stars revolve more slowly than less slander the stars.
Riball compares the stars with the dancers: larger make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" of the Pleiad we see that those that rotate slowly, usually more massive, while those that rotate faster, usually belong to very light stars," said Riball.
Since the Pleiac cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for mapping the properties of stars with rotation speeds.
"The Star cluster of Pleiada provides a starting point for the theoretical models of rotation of the stars, both the younger and the older," Riball said.
We still want to learn a lot about how, where and why the stars slow down the speed of their rotation and hang on the nail their "dance shoes," figuratively speaking.
Ribal and her colleagues described in detail their last analysis of the speeds of Pleiad rotation in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomy magazine.
The investigation, related to the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea, is conducted by two agencies, says Kommersant.
The FSB collects evidence of involvement of the detainees in preparation of sabotage in Crimea.
As previously reported, the confession was given by a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar Yevgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, as objects for sabotage, he considered the "Titan" chemical plant in Armenia, oil base in Feodosia, Kerch ferry, gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields.
Law enforcers believe that not all the accomplices of saboteurs were detained.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev district court of Simferopol, the newspaper notes.
Stanislav Cherchesov became the head coach of the Russian national football team
At a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov, the head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with it will be designed for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the executive committee of the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian national football team.
This is a well-known footballer, who previously played in Moscow "Spartak" in the position of goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was a mentor of such Russian teams as all the same "Spartacus," "Pearl-Sochi," "Terek," "Amkar," "Dynamo," as well as Warsaw "Legia," which became the winner of the national championship and the cup of the country.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the near future and is designed for two years.
Thus, it is he who is obliged to prepare the national team for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romaschenko, Gintaras Stauch, Vladimir Pannikov.
There is information that the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to the media, the leadership of the Russian Federation has set Stanislav Cherchesov the goal of leading Russia to the semi-finals and win medals.
According to the coach, as a priority, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and is going to give the players the opportunity to prove themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov Russian team will hold on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly match with the Turkish team.
Earlier, the post of the head coach of the Russian national football team was Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with the coaching in the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after the failure of the Russian national team for Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the bad result of the national team on itself.
Squeezed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered a lot during a long struggle against apartheid.
However, after gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, this country with a population of 2.4 million has achieved great success, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for the success of Namibia is that the government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries are perceived as a matter of charge free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries in secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce a fee for training to "reimburse costs."
However, in Namibia, training in primary schools is free.
Moreover, since 2015, the secondary education has become free.
The country's authorities are also actively working in other important areas.
The efforts to destroy malaria reduced the number of annual cases of the disease by 97% in the last ten years.
Contrary to the international trend of inequality, it is decreasing in Namibia.
Compared to the indicator of 1993, the ratio of Gini, which is the standard indicator of income distribution inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
And the level of poverty decreased from 69% in 1993 to less than 30%.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) also decreased, from almost 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest rating of freedom of speech in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country is far ahead of the United States and other rich states.
In addition, the country has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Corruption Perception Index," which is made up by human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now, when the prices of raw materials fall, Namibia manages to maintain a high rate of growth.
At the same time, the debt-related attitude to GDP is around 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the level of debt in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional methods of assessment, remains quite high - almost 28%.
And, like other countries in the region, in Namibia, a high level of HIV/AIDS incidence - almost 17% of the population are infected.
According to estimates of the World Bank, Namibia is among the countries with incomes above average, but the authorities insist that their state is actually a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some difficulties that are inherent in poorly developed economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
On the territory of the country in the deserts live isolated nomadic tribes of hunters-raises, which in one way or another should be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: just like any other country in the world, it faces the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think of letting down, the country solves the problems facing her.
Almost immediately after gaining independence, the authorities began to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only of its own citizens, but also their neighbors.
About 15-20% of visitors to medical institutions in the northern districts of Namibia - Angadol citizens.
Nobody in Namibia speaks of building a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibitians realized that the neighbors did not choose, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share the shortage water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to encourage investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Namibia government justly reasoned that rich natural resources could easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that the revenues from the natural wealth of Namibia need to invest in infrastructure and production facilities.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek maximum profit from the sale of the country's resources, and revise investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that it is so.
Transparency is crucial for this process, so strong support for the government of freedom of speech is so important.
According to the Head of State Hague Gingob, the media often say what he does not like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the liberties, the president says.
Not all of the key resources of Namibia are exhausted.
Some - such as fishing - refers to renewable, and the government makes every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that start with serious shortcomings - racism, colonial order, inequality and low level of development - can take the way to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the "Gold of Varna" - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps it was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varnanian non-cropolis, a fantastic amount of gold artifacts was found - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only from one burial, known as "mighted # 43," 990 gold items with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg were extracted.
However, the official status of the world's oldest gold can soon go to the inconspicuous look of the beads found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement, known as Tell Yunaceta.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tell Yunacite is located away from the sea, near the village of Yunacite Pazardzhik district.
Busin is a golden strip, wrapped in a ring.
Yavor Boyajiyev, the head of the excavations in Telle Yunacite, dated the discovery of 4600 BC and said that she is older than the gold of Varna for at least 200 years.
The Treasures of Varna, we recall, date back to approximately the same period, 4600 - 4200 BC.
Technology, allowing with impeccable accuracy to date metal, currently does not exist.
Where is the certainty of what gold is older?
Obviously, Professor Boyajiyev knows more than reported to Reuters: "I am absolutely sure that Yunasita's gold is older than Varna's gold."
It's a find of extreme importance: it's a tiny object, but it's big enough to take a possible place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Bojadzhiev said that in the near future scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re-and-scan study the archaeological layer, where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bead with the maximum possible accuracy.
The place of find also explains a lot.
Tell Yunaceite is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Currently, Telll Yunaceite is considered the oldest "city" of Europe.
The Tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in 7 millennia BC.
Over the next centuries, metal processing has been rapidly developing in this region, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the domestic historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: the Balkan-Carpathian Metallurgical province.
In 5 millennia BC around the centers of metalworking began to arise urban settlements.
Now they are called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunaceta, perhaps the oldest, as here were found artifacts 4900 BC.
I would call Tell Yunacete the prototype of the modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This is a place older than Sumer for a thousand years," says Boyadzhiev, bearing in mind the generally accepted opinion that urban culture was born in the south of Mesopotamia - modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the usual sense of the word.
The excavations of Tella Yunazite have been conducted since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists excavated almost 12 hectares, it is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall were found, which once reached three meters in height.
There is little that has survived from houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish the streets, public buildings, urban dense construction, "business center" and residential outskirts.
Tell Yunaceta is often called the "Bird City": dozens of clay figurines of birds were found here.
All birds are depicted in a state of rest, from here there was an assumption that they were not decorative objects, but an object of a local cult.
The Bird City was destroyed about 4100 BC - perhaps the Indo-European tribes that came from the northeast.
The nomads had no cities, but there were horses and weapons.
The three-meter fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of brutal slaughter: inside the houses were found the remains of old men, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by combat axes.
New findings and new facts appear annually, changing the usual ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe, which was born in the Balkans.
The "gold of Varna" found relatively recently in 1972 became a powerful stimulus in search of this civilization.
It is logical that the golden luxury of Varna had to precede something - something like a tiny gold beads created in Telle Yunacite.
In Porsche artificially aged model 911 Targa
Officially stated that the preparation of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by specialists of the division who work with serial machines.
"Retro-on-onok" is, for example, in a special color of the body Etna Blue, which was developed back in 1960 for the model Porsche 356B - in this color painted even the logo model.
In addition, the targa has received a branded white graphics along the boards and special 20-inch wheels RS Spyder, as well as some details of the body design painted in the "white-gold metallic."
In the interior of retro draws noticeably less: it differs, by and large, the gray-blue range of design, new armchairs with extended ranges of electrical adjustments and trimmed black anodized steel thresholds with the logo of the unit.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive as a gift a case for the car and a richly finished album with photos of the production process.
Porsche Exclusive specialists did not touch the power plant: the retro target according to the characteristics is quite the same as the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder turbocharged motor with a volume of 3.0 liters, developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S is able to accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in a limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each particular sports car is reported.
Facebook and ad blockers unleashed "arms race"
The recent introduction of Facebook technology that prevented the concealment of advertising on the pages of the social network, provoked developers solutions to block advertising on responses.
AdBlock Plus released "opposition," but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus advertised its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
Representatives of the social network noted that, trying to deceive the new technology of "unblocked" advertising, the decision from AdBlock Plus together with commercial ads blocks and many ordinary posts from friends or pages.
Facebook regretted this policy of AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
As the source among the developers of the social network publication TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop website Facebook, will be ready within the next hours.
Thus, social networks and blockers unleashed a kind of "arms race," trying to beat each other, the affected party were users who missed interesting recordings from friends or saw advertising where they were not used to seeing it.
Ethical aspects of blocking advertising in recent times cause hot disputes.
In Murmansk, the perpetrator will appear before the court - Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been completed in the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation in the Murmansk region.
The accused of a 54-year-old man is very serious - committing sexual violence.
The investigation found that in late November 2015 the defendant in the area of Pavlova Street in Murmansk committed sexual acts with the use of violence against a 20-year-old girl. The criminal case with the approved indictment is sent for consideration on the merits.
The sanction of this article provides for maximum punishment in the form of imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia cross van Fengguang 370 and pickup Rich New - website Behind the wheel www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the growing popularity in China class of cars, combining the advantages of minivan and crossover.
Another declared Russian prime minister is the Rich New pickup.
Many Western companies of the Moscow International Motor Show this year decided to ignore, so the void of the exhibition halls "Crocus Expo" will be filled by Chinese companies.
In particular, the powerful front will be Dongfeng Motor, which has great views on the Russian market and intends to offer our motorists a number of interesting novelties.
One of them will be the cross van Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which came on sale in China this spring at a price of 55 900 yuan (a little less than 550 thousand rubles at the current rate).
Such a price tag is unlikely to shine for Russians, and the question of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 on the results of June sales managed to get to the 11th place in the list of the best-selling minivans, although due to the large road clearance (175 mm) and protective plastic weight on the lower perimeter of the body it is quite possible to count crossovers.
Crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the younger model Fengguang 360, the 370th has the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm vs. 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden bars, but shown in the photo a large vertical touch screen "like Tesla" on the center console was only in the early exhibition copies of the cross-country, and on sale came cars with "music" easier.
Five of the seven seats are easy to fold, forming a smooth loading pad with a length of 1650 mm, the maximum volume of the trunk - 1500 liters.
The engine for Fengguang 370 is provided with only one - 1.5-liter gasoline "atmospheric" with a capacity of 115 hp, docked with a 5-speed manual transmission.
On the dynamic qualities of the machine manufacturer modestly keep silent, but promises a gentle budget of the owner appetite at the level of 6.7 liters / 100 km.
The Rich New pickup is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara of the past generation, but with a slightly ennobled Chinese style design.
Despite the obsolete design, this model is still in stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious "working horse."
At a similar price Rich New is likely to be interested in Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become excessively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: petrol 2.4 l (137 hp) or 2.5 l turbodiesel (116 hp).
The gearbox is only mechanics, drive - on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a rigidly connected "next."
Will be at the stand of Dongfeng and the new flagship sedan A9, its Russian premier office of the Chinese firm announced in June.
The pastine-like crossovers in the Chinese market are becoming more and more, one of the latest novelties - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng range consists of two models: sedan S30 and H30 Cross hatchback.
In the seven months of this year, Chinese dealers sold 696 cars in our country.
Tax notices on the transport tax will cease to be sent by mail - website Behind the wheel www.zr.ru
Tax inspection has changed the procedure for sending notifications about property taxes.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to the scheme that has not changed for years: in summer and autumn they receive by mail receipts for payment of transport tax for the previous year.
However, this year many of them will not wait.
The fact is that the tax office without too much noise has changed the order of notification of citizens.
Those who are registered in the "Personal account of the taxpayer" on the official website of the agency nalog.ru, the notifications will come in electronic form.
In the inspection automatically considered such Russians online users and deleted them from the standard, "paper" mailing.
The innovation will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All the others will still receive familiar letters.
However, the ability to return to the old scheme and the owners of the account on the site.
To do this, they will have to visit the department of the tax service during August and write an application.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal cabinet" immediately after the compilation, while the letter will go for several days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service tax inspection exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the agency to seriously save on mailing.
On the other hand, modest news on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed procedure.
Some could register in the "personal account" to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for the notice by mail and, without knowing it themselves, fall into the category of non-payers with all the ensuing consequences.
Access to the "Personal account of the taxpayer" is carried out in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, by electronic signature or entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The last can be obtained in person in any department of the tax inspection (regardless of the place of registration).
We remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid before December 1.
The newsletter of notifications began in July.
The tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, in which the improvements are aimed at achieving a very high return, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the masters of the company G-Power, who took up the modification of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human to its masters is not alien.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - 571-strong flying sage with aerodynamics of the tank and overclocking up to a hundred in 5.4 s?
Inflating the "musculs" of the crazy "hel," the masters took advantage of the advantages that opens the 5.5-liter supercharged "eight."
But the dynamics of dispersal to hundreds improved on indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "krick" is capable of a jerk for 5.3 s.
However, acceleration from medium speeds is likely given to him much better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 is faster than 210 km/h does not drive, the tuning SUV with deactivated electronic collar is able to squeeze 250 km/h.
On the outside, the car is almost indistinguishable from its factory source, except for other wheels - 23-inch Hurricane RR dimension 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury division of Mercedes-Maybach announced the striking 6 m long concept coupe, which will be presented in the framework of the Competition of elegance in Pebble Beach.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the "green subbrand" BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate trademark.
In the coming years, at least four environmentally friendly novelties are expected to appear.
