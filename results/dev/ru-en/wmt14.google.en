Germany is the first in Europe to introduce &quot;indeterminate gender&quot; when registering children
Germany will become the first country in Europe to be allowed to use &quot;undefined&quot; instead of male or female when registering hermaphrodite children.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the gender field blank on the birth certificate for a while.
Instead of &quot;F&quot; (female) or &quot;M&quot; (male), parents can temporarily write &quot;X&quot; (indefinite).
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to rush into the operation to &quot;clarify&quot; the gender.
According to statistics, one in 2 thousand newborns in the world is born with hermaphrodite.
Anger over the verdict of the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 victims of the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angrily to the verdict handed down on the last conspirator to stand trial and said Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in creating the explosive devices used in the attack.
He can be released for 15 years if he gets parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.
He was also found guilty on a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a spate of church bombings across Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
Prosecutors have demanded a life sentence, although they could have insisted that the man dubbed a &quot;bomber&quot; for his reputation as a bomber should be sentenced to death.
The decision exacerbated the painful memories of Perth mother June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack by Patek and his associates nearly a decade ago.
Barely holding back tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
He has to appear before the firing squad, ”Ms. Cortin told AAP.
&quot;I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.&quot;
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device planted in a van parked outside was detonated just after 11pm on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy&#39;s Bar where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After this terrorist attack, he fell into a coma for a month and &quot;died&quot; three times, being connected to the life support system.
Mr. Hughes said Patek must share the fate of three other members of the Jemaa Islamiya terrorist cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty more than anyone.
To keep him alive, well, there&#39;s no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the participants in the terrorist attack in Bali to stand trial.
He went into hiding for nearly a decade, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence evidence indicated Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish ties between the Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn&#39;t give up,” said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he did not at all regret how much grief he caused other people.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” says Ms Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
Medvedev expects SSJ-100 aircraft to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after gaining a foothold in the markets of Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 aircraft will also be supplied to Europe.
&quot;We expect that in total we will receive such agreements for more than 170 aircraft of this type,&quot; Interfax quotes the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayro.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with French colleagues, since this is a joint project.
Today we discussed some financial issues related to insurance, but we hope that after this aircraft strengthens in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be supplied to our partners in Europe.
“I hope that someday it will also be supplied to France,” the Russian prime minister stressed.
The SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by Sukhoi Civil Aircraft in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
The goalkeeper of “Chicago” Nikolai Khabibulin stressed: he understands that he must play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings, “Hawks” Khabibulin first conceded six goals from “Tampa Bay”, and then four from “Ottawa”, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth conceded washer.
We have to play well, but in the last two games I did not succeed, &#39;&#39; CSNChicago quotes Khabibulin as saying.
- I need to find confidence in training, I should probably approach them like games and try to achieve the best result.
You must study your past games and work on those shortcomings that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel pretty decent.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The goalkeepers - I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the only one - are always trying to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I&#39;m not happy.
It doesn&#39;t matter what happens in front of my gate.
I&#39;m still working on myself so as not to miss so many goals.
It&#39;s great that my teammates are supportive, but in principle everything is simple: I have to play better.
Two games is not the whole season, but I wanted to play them much better.
But it happened, what happened.
I have to put this aside.
I&#39;ll just try to play the next match better.
Power engineers of Dnipropetrovsk region have started a unique program to rescue ... stork nests
In the old days, in order to welcome storks to the yard, the villagers installed a wheel from a cart on a high post, and the heavy nest held on well to it.
Such special supports have not been installed for a long time, therefore storks have chosen the poles of power lines - the intertwined branches rest on wires, thanks to which the stork house stands securely.
Grandmother Anya, near whose house in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikovsky district, a stork family has been living for twenty years, began to notice how the nest was settling, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new twigs on top, and the bottom layer has already sunk between the wires, is about to collapse.
Of course, I feel sorry for the family of storks, which every year nested at the farmstead, hatched and fed three or four chicks over the summer, but I don&#39;t want to be left without light.
As soon as the birds flew away to the warm lands, grandmother Anya called the Tsarichansky Distribution Zone, which owns the support.
And I didn’t even expect that they would react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, ”said Sergey Berezovsky, technical director of DTEK Dneprooblenergo.
Corrosion began on the wires, which were, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150-200 kilograms.
At any moment, the birds could die from an electrical discharge.
And local residents risked being left without electricity due to damage to the wires.
Therefore, line fitters have begun an operation to save the nest, and this is not the first time in our practice.
Scientists-ornithologists from Dnepropetrovsk National University helped, who developed a scheme for transferring the nest.
They also conducted trainings for employees of district networks.
The famous Dnipropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko consulted power engineers at all stages of nest reconstruction.
To begin with, it was calculated that more than 50 stork &quot;apartments&quot; are in disrepair in the region.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were welded, resembling a funnel.
The base was braided with willow branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay the old branches as a base for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Only then the storks themselves will finish building their dwelling.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka, Novomoskovsk District.
A new reinforced concrete post was placed next to the electric support and a platform with an old, already inhabited nest was placed on it.
The entire operation cost the power engineers nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day, the same housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikovsky district, in the courtyard of Anya&#39;s grandmother.
Here the platform was fixed in its original place, only it was raised above the wires.
Bird watchers are sure that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their &quot;apartment&quot; has undergone major repairs.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction is expected for four more nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of the Dnipropetrovsk region.
By the way, while some are saving rare birds, others are ruthlessly killing them.
A few days ago, sad news spread throughout the region - in the village of Ust-Kamenka, Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of the pheasant hunt, poachers shot a swan family that lived on a local pond for fun.
Noble birds were not at all afraid of people - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers, hearing the shots, ran to the pond, four handsome swans were already lying dead on the water.
Now employees of the Apostolovskiy regional police department are trying to find out who shot at the birds listed in the Red Book.
American Boeing stuck in Chita prepares to take off
The American plane, which conducted observation flights over the territory of Russia under the Open Skies Treaty and made an unscheduled landing in Chita on Wednesday, will leave the city&#39;s air harbor at 8:30 Moscow time on Friday, November 1.
The airport authorities allowed the board to take off, having received money for fuel.
According to the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other sources, he will go to the United States.
As reported, the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Trans-Baikal Territory due to fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not allowed out of the Chita airport.
There are 30 people on board, including the crew; they spent two nights at the airport, ITAR-TASS reports.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, according to the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, people on board the aircraft are not allowed to leave the Chita airport, they can go through border control only at two Russian airports - in Kubinka and Ulan-Ude.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992 and includes 34 states.
Observation flights are performed over the territories of Russia, the USA, Canada, and European countries.
The main objectives of the Treaty are the development of transparency, assistance in monitoring the implementation of agreements in the field of arms control, expanding the capacity for crisis prevention and settlement of crisis situations within the OSCE and other international organizations.
Vitaly Mutko: Water cannons?
It seems to me that we have returned 15 years ago.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the riots in the stands during the Russian Cup match Shinnik - Spartak.
I am a supporter of the organizers of sporting events being responsible for all this: clubs, league, RFU.
But we see that they have taken a different position.
They are waiting for someone from the outside to come and put things in order.
This is a very good position, but not entirely correct.
We need to organize the fans, clubs should invite their stewards, and not let things take their course.
We have now developed a special government decree on the rules of conduct at stadiums.
After it is adopted, we will closely tackle this problem.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read an interview with Leonid Fedun.
The state, they say, give the law quickly.
It seems that the fans of “Bavaria” came to Yaroslavl and arranged it all.
And we are outside observers.
In general, it is terrible to see how the tribune is watered with a cannon.
And this is in a country preparing for the World Cup.
“I have a feeling that we are back 10-15 years ago,” Mutko said.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned gang leader about police investigation jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to crime boss Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told the drug lord about a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be exposed, was jailed for three years.
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on classified information to crime boss Neil Scarborough about an investigation into his drug trafficking activities after he was threatened by his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash and dubbed &quot;the tough lawyer&quot; among the criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to spy on Scarborough, whom he represented earlier in a drug-related trial.
Officers noticed Scarborough, 32, leave three packets of cocaine at a lawyer&#39;s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a bar association dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta &quot;regularly used&quot; the Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were at that time under police surveillance as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized £ 1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine in a series of raids, as well as over £ 200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, passed information on to criminals out of fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today at Liverpool Royal Court, Ditt, who works for Forbes Solicitors, a Blackburn-based law firm, was in disgrace after being convicted of two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial in Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to possession of cocaine at a previous court hearing.
The lawyer&#39;s exposure came after police investigating Scarborough&#39;s activities found that he had regularly spoken to Ditt on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect and found him walking up to Ditt&#39;s Blackburn house and placing 60 percent pure drugs in a black golf glove under a lawyer&#39;s dustbin.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough called Ditt multiple times, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers&#39; Ewood Park Football Stadium.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine conversations took place between them.
The court learned that Ditta &quot;regularly used&quot; cocaine after tests found traces of the Class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, said he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was &quot;attorney-client privilege.&quot;
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but they were all confiscated and a hair sample was taken from him.
When interrogated by the police, he said that along with his work place, he had a home office and clients came to his home on legal matters.
However, the court learned that after important arrests, he called the largest participants in drug trafficking, a number of whom he previously represented in court, to tell what detectives know about them.
In her indictment, Anne White said, &quot;If anyone knows they shouldn&#39;t break the law, it&#39;s a criminal defense attorney.&quot;
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney, as he entered into too close relationships with certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly prove legitimate, since he was their lawyer.
However, this largely went beyond the usual attorney-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible in order to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored it.
He became too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and allowed his disinterest to be questioned.
Ditta pleaded not guilty and said: &quot;If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and would like to convey information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.&quot;
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, &quot;Mr. Ditta went from a criminal defense attorney to a felon as soon as he began acquiring drugs from organized crime.&quot;
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the targets of the main members of the criminal gangs, who tasked him with obtaining valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and instill trust and confidence in the community.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind his profession.
Mr. Ditt&#39;s investigation was led by Lancashire&#39;s Highly Dangerous Organized Crime Unit, which has already secured a sentence for him on three cocaine possession and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We will find you and prosecute you.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the fraud were sentenced in total to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta hosted a Q&amp;A session in which he says his dream job is a lawyer representing death-sentenced clients in America, his ideal dinner companion is Mohammed Ali, and his motivation is inequality. ...
Jetmakers feud over seat width when large orders are at stake
A bitter dispute has erupted among leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The controversy revolves around the width of the seats provided on long-haul flights to economy class passengers, whose interests are not always the focus of airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the claims about the efficiency of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would require seat widths of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class cabins, but its main US rival Boeing says it is up to airlines to decide.
The controversy comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell larger versions of their long-haul twin-engine aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected at an event on November 17-21.
The layout of the rear of the plane - especially whether 9 or 10 people sit in a row - is central to claims about the cost-effectiveness of new &quot;mini-airbus&quot; designs.
Boeing says its revamped 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on more than 17 inches wide economy class seats, with 10 in each row.
Airbus says a competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch, 9-in-row seats.
The aircraft giants often trade blows on technical issues through advertisements in the professional press.
Airbus is now speaking directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to lead with over 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what a new advertising war could be like by showing financiers a slide of three people in a restaurant huddled together, titled &quot;Would you agree to this?&quot;
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus sales chief.
With the change in diet, people gain weight, but the plane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standard for modern long-distance travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the US Department of Health.
The average American man in the 21st century has a waist circumference of 39.7 inches, according to statistics from the US Health Service.
Airbus claims its competitor is sticking to the 1950s seating concept, when the average waist circumference of those who were recently dubbed the &quot;jet public&quot; was narrower.
Airbus says it has commissioned research showing that an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus&#39; seat size figures and says manufacturers should not get involved in decisions about how airlines balance fares and amenities.
Research shows cabin comfort isn&#39;t just about seat width, she said.
“It really comes down to giving airlines the choice and the ability to do what they think they need to do to be successful,” said Boeing&#39;s cabin specialist Kent Craver.
They do not want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is more side space, but for suppliers this is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect margins.
Behind this controversy is a race for aircraft orders valued at at least $ 700 billion in catalog prices over the coming decades - enough to change the balance of American to European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating arrangement is precisely what is fueling the rivalry in the battle between the latest jet aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 percent one-seat profitability improvement in their latest twin-engine long-haul models over the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing&#39;s claims are based in part on a comparison of the 10-seat 777X to the original 9-seat 777 design.
The unit cost benefit is reduced when compared to the current 10-seat layout.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze in more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our designs,” said Kevin Keniston, head of Europe for Airbus Passenger Comfort.
On the other hand, analysts say cabins with full 10-seat rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a tight seating, which can go hand-in-hand with lower fares.
“Eighteen-inch seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that, commercially, Airbus&#39;s offering is driven by the threat from the 777,” said interior designer Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a supplier directory from which airlines can choose.
Traveling jet sellers around the world even carry tape measures with them to check competing layouts.
While touting comfort, all manufacturers also offer super-dense aircraft for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus is offering the A350 with 10-seat rows, but says it hasn&#39;t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional cabin modifications, offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the backing of a single other manufacturer of large, modern aircraft, experts say her call for a new industry standard is unlikely to skyrocket, but may divert attention from the 777X&#39;s wave of sales.
Oleinikov: a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region are completely subsidized
The vice-governor of the Moscow region, Yuri Oleinikov, said that almost a third of the rural settlements of the Moscow region are completely subsidized
In total, 187 out of 288 settlements receive subsidies from the regional budget.
In 2013, 187 out of 288 settlements receive subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 are 100% subsidized.
As part of the budgetary provision, about 25 billion rubles are allocated from the regional budget, &quot;Oleinikov said.
The vice-governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mytishchi, Odintsovo and Pushkino - have budget revenues of more than 1 billion rubles in 2013.
Incomes of rural settlements in many districts are less than 3 million rubles, &quot;this is not enough at all.&quot;
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of the Moscow region is over 70%, &quot;while there is a decrease in the quality of services,&quot; said Oleinikov.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of the municipalities of the Moscow Region to think over which settlements need to be consolidated, unified into urban districts or change the system of administrative management by the end of November.
These proposals will be completed by the end of January.
Prior to this, the governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in the Moscow region, it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in Mozhaisky, Kashirsky, Solnechnogorsky, Kolomensky districts, Lyubertsy and Kotelniki there is a request for enlargement of municipalities.
Discussion of this issue in cities and districts of the region will begin in November.
The chairman of the Moscow Regional Duma Igor Bryntsalov also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of the Moscow region are planning to unite in total within the framework of the upcoming administrative reform.
This is due to the fact that out of 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region, less than a third have an &quot;acceptable&quot; financial base, and 100 have subsidized ones.
Mozambique&#39;s Security Concerns Rise Due to Conflict of Powerful People
Under the statue of Zamora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, gazing down at them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peace slogans at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want the return of peace; we want stability, ”said Vanessa de Susa, chief executive of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit for a T-shirt emblazoned with the words “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital&#39;s Independence Square.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo - some of the most violent clashes since the ceasefire more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, backed first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the apartheid South African government as part of an effort to destabilize the country&#39;s independent government.
After the 1992 ceasefire, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to slide back into full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
The stakes are high for a fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal reserves in the northwest could attract more than $ 50 billion in investments over the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy, and Anadarko from the United States. ...
The ruling Frelimo party, a leading political force since 1975, and Renamo&#39;s party blame each other for the resulting tensions.
Renamo&#39;s party claims that the government was the instigator of the latest clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, the traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
Attacks on former insurgents then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to assassinate Afonso Dhlakama, the group&#39;s leader, Fernando Mazanga, a spokesman for Renamo, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating the clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to allay fears of instability.
Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt like a &quot;failure&quot; to use &quot;whatever was left of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government.&quot;
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew after reports that Mazanga had announced Renamo&#39;s withdrawal from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he was referring to the non-compliance by Frelimo&#39;s party.
“Our goal is to get back to negotiations, but with all seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous inter-party talks have done little to defuse tensions that have been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama) facing each other,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo&#39;s party, which is trying to push for electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to win concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in this election.
Mr Mazanga says Mr Gebuza, who is due to step down next year when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn&#39;t want multi-party democracy, he doesn&#39;t want transparent elections, he doesn&#39;t want peace because he doesn&#39;t want to leave the presidency,&quot; Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capabilities Renamo has, but she has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south highway.
Most of the skirmishes took place in Sofala province, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo but includes Beira, a port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railroad tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railroad.
Mazanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo&#39;s party wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has heightened discontent with the government, and many people are also worried about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent increase in kidnappings, said Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and the president must find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultuan, a demonstrator, said people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace to resume, they want free access to the roads,” he said.
Australia Aircraft Regulations Remain in Force for the Time being
Australian airline passengers will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the United States to relax the rules regarding these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has allowed US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during takeoff and landing, provided they remain in Airplane Mode.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the move, which required US airlines to do a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Administration also noted that they are considering this application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight are still in force in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Administration currently does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on aircraft,” it said.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to ensure the maintenance of security at all times, and from passengers - to comply with the safety rules that are communicated to them by the crew.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority about expanding on-board use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system, was not opposed to the change, but said it would follow the regulator&#39;s instructions.
“We would welcome consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we really think it will improve the customer experience now that we have it (in-flight wireless entertainment) on our aircraft,” said a spokesman. ...
Qantas said it will adhere to the current regulations.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not plan to change it anytime soon,” she said.
The FAA regulation applies to American airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly be looking closely at the FAA&#39;s decision and the reasons behind it.
For US carriers, the impact of the regulation will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove their aircraft is immune to radio interference from mobile devices, and review manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage regulations and passenger instructions.
“Once the airline has verified and confirmed the immunity of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at any altitude,” the FAA said.
In the rare event of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during boarding.
In addition, the group recommends that heavier devices should be located under seats or in overhead storage areas during takeoff and landing.
Obama backtracks on health care
Amidst a storm of criticism, President Obama backed down yesterday on his often repeated, unequivocal promise that &quot;if you like your health plan, you can keep it.&quot;
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people receiving cessation notices from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for misleading American society.
Obama tweaked his initial public pledge yesterday.
“Most people with health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called the &quot;news buzz&quot; over the discontinuation of services, Obama urged the Americans receiving the notices to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to get the best, comprehensive health insurance plans for the same price or even less than predicted.
“You will get better terms,” he said.
The administration said it shouldn&#39;t surprise anyone that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because coverage does not meet the new standards required by the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me tell these Americans straight out: you deserve better,” Sibelius said in a speech before the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the e-commerce site has been &quot;appallingly bad&quot; since October.
“I&#39;m just as upset and angry as everyone else,” she said.
&quot;I really want to get your trust back.&quot;
An annoyed Sibelius dropped the line, which was picked up by a turned on microphone, to an aide sitting behind her at yesterday&#39;s House hearing after a heated debate with Rep. Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, about whether she should join Obama&#39;s health program herself.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the Affordable Care Law &quot;architect&quot; did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now imposes on millions of Americans.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev announced on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian law.
France can have no doubt that the case will be reviewed in compliance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
&quot;We can guarantee the observance of the laws,&quot; Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Hérault.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisan, like the rest of the activists, was charged with hooliganism.
&quot;I asked if we can expect a humanitarian gesture against the detained citizen,&quot; RIA Novosti quotes Mr. Ero.
&quot;Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to break laws,&quot; Dmitry Medvedev said in turn.
According to him, the activities of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including the extraction of energy resources, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects are &quot;like a powder keg&quot; and recalled what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, RIA Novosti reports.
A friend of Semyon Varlamov said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of hockey player Semyon Varlamov, Evgenia Vavrinyuk, said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
&quot;He has no idea how to stop drinking,&quot; - said, in particular, the woman.
Recall that Vavrinyuk filed a lawsuit for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian national team Semyon Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado club.
According to her, the hockey player dragged her by the hair and also beat her - after the attack, her arms, chest, stomach and neck were injured.
Varlamov himself came to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what happened.
He was arrested but later released on $ 5,000 bail.
The court did not restrict the athlete from moving around the country, but forbade him to approach Vavrinyuk.
He also faces up to 6 years in prison for domestic violence.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platformer for free
Blizzard released their 1994 platformer Blackthorne for free on PC.
Reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game has become available on Battle.net in the classic Blizzard games section.
However, some gamers point out that currently only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it.
The game is also not available for Russian users yet.
According to media reports, the version that Blizzard has now released on the PC does not look different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack for Blackthorne also remains unchanged.
The Blackthorne platformer, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally came out on the SNES consoles.
Its events took place on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
Once the dark ruler Sarlac decided to kill the light king Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight Sarlak&#39;s minions and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after being renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon &amp; Synapse.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
Coulson resorted to hacking his phone to verify a confidential message
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used &quot;phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation&quot; in an attempt to corroborate false information about the affair of Charles Clark, who was then Secretary of the Interior.
Prosecutor QC Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey Court that News of the World received false news in May 2005 that Clark was dating his &quot;attractive special adviser&quot; Hannah Polby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulkeire to hack into Polby&#39;s voice mail and lay in wait for her at the house to interview, but Coulson also called her and left voice messages, - the court heard.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who would stand outside someone&#39;s house hoping to catch someone off guard, he is a person who loves to bring history to people to see. what will they say, ”said Mr. Edis.
He said that the News of the World newspaper used three ways to investigate stories: hacking phones, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking phones?
He says no, we say, &quot;Oh, yes!&quot;
Rumors of Clark&#39;s romance first came to the attention of News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby was told, &quot;Don&#39;t waste time, she&#39;s with Charles.&quot;
A cassette of voice messages received from her phone at least three times was seized from Mulqueira&#39;s home in August 2006.
Investigators also found notes on the private detective&#39;s computer, in which Miss Polby and her sister appeared as &quot;Projects.&quot;
During the time she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby&#39;s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis said.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville Thirlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised surveillance of Ms. Polby&#39;s movements.
Leaving her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, &quot;I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to discuss with Charles.&quot;
Mr. Edis said that Coulson&#39;s involvement in this story followed the same scenario as with other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson got into a confrontation with Mr. Blankett over an affair with a married woman while he was dating his co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks deny colluding with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkeir, Thirlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hacking phones.
In the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no &quot;Brothers Circle&quot; grouping, to which Leps was ranked in the USA
The Bratskiy Krug grouping, to which Washington ranked singer Grigory Leps, does not appear in the databases of the Russian security officials.
As Interfax was told in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after the media reported that the US Treasury Department had included Grigory Leps on the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian crime syndicate &quot;Brothers Circle&quot;, all databases were checked, but such a group was not found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth about the so-called &quot;Russian mafia&quot;, which allegedly operates abroad, according to the security forces.
&quot;Even in the very name - &#39;Brothers&#39; circle&#39;, there is a certain element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret lodge.
&quot;All this is very similar to a PR campaign,&quot; said the agency&#39;s interlocutor.
On October 31, the US Treasury Department announced that Arthur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov were added to their control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Brothers Circle Eurasian crime syndicate.
The persons on this list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on the US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps &quot;serves as a courier to deliver money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev.&quot;
The production center of Grigory Leps refused to comment on the US accusations against the singer, calling them &quot;nonsense.&quot;
In 2011, US President Barack Obama classified the Brothers&#39; Circle syndicate as a &quot;significant transnational organized crime group&quot; and instructed the Treasury to &quot;undermine and prohibit their global criminal operations.&quot;
The inclusion of a person on the blacklists of the US Treasury Department entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with people living in the States.
Scientists have shed light on how a dog&#39;s tail movement is related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that happy dogs wag their tail to the right (from a dog&#39;s point of view), while anxious dogs wag their tail predominantly to the left.
But now scientists say other canids can notice and respond to these subtle differences in tail wagging.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, says: &quot;It is well known that in humans, the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the formation of stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.&quot;
Here we tried to look at this in other species as well.
He added that just like in humans, in dogs, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotion.
To learn more about how dogs respond to other dogs&#39; versatile tail wagging, the researchers observed the animals while they watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
Probably, soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go one way, and sometimes the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We showed dogs videos of dogs - either naturalistic versions or silhouette, to get rid of any other distortions, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or right.&quot;
When the animals saw that the otherwise expressionless dog moved its tail to the right (from the point of view of a dog wagging its tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was tilting predominantly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging the tail), their heart rate increased and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said he doesn&#39;t think the dogs intentionally communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they should worry about and which ones they shouldn&#39;t.
He notes: &quot;If there are several encounters with other dogs and often wagging their tail to one side is associated with friendlier behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog will react based on this experience.&quot;
The researchers say these results could give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their pet&#39;s emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol Veterinary School, said this was not the first study to test whether left and right sides mattered in dogs.
Last year, a team of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a contented dog.
And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: &quot;Dogs were more likely to approach a robotic dog when its tail wagged to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious — the opposite of an Italian study.&quot;
He said the differences could be because dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in films or robotic dogs as dogs.
Research into how dogs respond to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“While there is ample evidence for different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details remain to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other.
Are the elite of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to gather business representatives and identify what changes UK wealth and job creators want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to share their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders representing a broad cross-section of UK businesses by size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are currently looking for export opportunities outside of Europe, with a particular focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while the EU is stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and arduous process of reforming the EU’s tangled institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key areas of expertise should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives arguing that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in a European trade zone, even 40 percent of the large, traditionally most pro-European of all companies agreed.
Last but not least, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority want the UK to pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This result, which has been seen among businesses of all sizes and major business groups, shows that businesses are pushing for a “meaningful change” that will bring empowerment back to the UK.
The stakes are high - achieving treaty changes and better terms for the UK would provide a 16 percent shift in voting to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubts: this poll shows that British businesses support his plan to renegotiate the UK&#39;s EU membership.
He also shows that business expects the revision to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
Better conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a path of closer economic and financial unification.
Jobs and economic growth in the UK should be prioritized, and our survey results show that for businesses this means a heightened focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels&#39; regulatory action.
Politician in Turkey goes on hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, authorities began construction of a separation wall near the city of Nusaybin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish PMD party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin on the border with Syria, Aishe Gokhan, went on a hunger strike to protest the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMD) told RIA Novosti on Friday.
The police broke up protest demonstrations on several occasions.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammer Guler first denied the construction, then said that the wall was being built to ensure border security.
&quot;The mayor of Nusaybin, Aishe Gokhan, a member of the PMD, went on a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle,&quot; the party&#39;s press service said.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds have crossed this border freely for half a century.
&quot;This is an inhuman situation with which the Kurds will never agree,&quot; the party representatives quoted Aishe Gokhan.
According to the press service, on November 7, a rally against the construction of the separation wall is planned in Nusaybin.
This morning in the Saratsky district the driver of the &quot;Peugeot&quot; car drove into the oncoming lane on the 115 km of the Odessa-Reni highway and collided with a bus with six people.
This was reported by the press service of the State Emergency Service in the Odessa region.
As a result of the accident, a 31-year-old Peugeot driver was killed.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver were injured, whose leg was pinched.
Doctors provided the woman with first aid on the spot, she refused hospitalization.
Also, ambulance staff examined all other passengers.
Rescuers lifted the bus with a crane and freed the bus driver, whose leg was caught in the bus door.
You shouldn&#39;t be a vegan in Siberia: a greenhouse tomato won&#39;t replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, the RIA Novosti correspondent found out.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they will not survive the winter without health losses, and no greenhouse tomatoes will compensate them, according to Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors interviewed on the eve of Vegan Day.
Drink oil in liters
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, is becoming a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists are sure that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia, adhering to such strict dietary standards is at least unhealthy.
Avoiding animal products altogether is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids that are very difficult to compensate with plant proteins.
It is imperative to include at least milk or eggs in the diet, ”says nutritionist Marina Bogay.
She cites the example of fish, which contains the essential omega-3 fatty acid.
The richest vegetable oil in it is flaxseed.
&quot;To consume it in the quantities necessary for a person, you need to drink liters!&quot; - says the nutritionist.
Doctors are sure that the inhabitants of Siberia need to pay special attention to their diet in winter.
Vegetarianism is especially challenged this season.
In the conditions of our realities, high demands are made on food.
In order not to freeze, you need an increased calorie content.
&quot;If a person restricts himself on animal products, accordingly, he does not get enough of this caloric value,&quot; says the specialist.
Nutritionist Olga Poznyak agrees with this.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not an option.
It is better for a person to eat mainly products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is tuned to better assimilate and digest these foods.
And in winter people do not want to gnaw a cucumber, but a hot soup or something more satisfying, &quot;the doctor explains his position.
From what vegans can eat, she says, various grains, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples that remain in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this is definitely not enough for good nutrition.
According to the gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, the level of vitamins in Siberians is sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and snow lies in May, is inappropriate.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, first of all, fat, &quot;the doctor states.
Doctors point out that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
And by adhering to vegetarianism, we give them inferior ones.
Pregnant women also need a high content of protein, vitamins and minerals in the menu.
&quot;Vegan women don&#39;t get enough of them,&quot; Bogay is sure.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose whatever he wants, &quot;to play with those toys that he wants.&quot;
He has an already formed organism, skeleton, organs.
And children still need to eat well.
If the parents deprive him of some trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, this is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
&quot;The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones will not be restored tomorrow,&quot; she says.
All interviewed medical specialists agree on the low quality of vegetables and fruits grown in greenhouses in winter and imported.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains fewer microelements that we need than (grown) in the open field.
“The quality of the products is not right,” says Bogai.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to reap more crops is detrimental to quality.
&quot;Apples do not turn brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and moldy, tomatoes are tasteless and odorless,&quot; the doctor gives examples, adding that they are most likely crammed with an excessive amount of fertilizer.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fiber.
Vera Petruk, the head of the laboratory of the Siberian Physics and Technology Institute of Agrarian Problems, Ph.D.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all norms and requirements, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables in greenhouses.
If they try to drive out more from a square meter, then, of course, they will water them more often, and overfeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there is too much nitrogen fertilization, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened, &quot;she explains, adding that the issue of quality, first of all, depends on the conscience of the producer.
Russia is out of the fight for urban pollution with cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities have been observed in most of the world&#39;s megacities since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was either about their reconstruction and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for car trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
The example of Singapore is widely known, where strict quotas for the increase in the number of private cars have been introduced, and the right to purchase them is bought at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times higher than the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced entry fees to the city center.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are being introduced, where only cars with a certain eco-class are allowed to enter, which also uses high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a &quot;five-year clean air plan&quot; in 2012 with a total value of about 250 billion yuan (about $ 40 billion).
Li Kunsheng, director of the transport pollution control department at the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, told Kommersant that the main goal of the five-year plan is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, and to increase the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5 , 2 million), as well as an increase of no more than 5% in fuel use per vehicle.
According to the agency, vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program are restrictions on the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the city&#39;s Green Five-Year Plan measures include an accelerated transition to European fuel standards compared to the rest of the country, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and labeling of cars and fuels, a restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, a ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (except in addition, the creation of incentive financial programs for replacing old cars with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and official), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Beijing&#39;s automotive innovations also include a ban on all private cars from driving within the fifth ring road (there are six of them in the capital of the PRC) one day a week (the corresponding information is contained in the vehicle&#39;s license plate), as well as the issuance of registration plates for cars on based on the lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number in 2010).
According to the current state program &quot;Environmental Protection for 2012-2020&quot;, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, in 2011, &quot;mobile sources&quot; accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial emissions, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In the Russian Federation, they are just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy at the Higher School of Economics, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for car travel are notoriously unpopular; they can be accepted by society only if they are completely universal.
In the case of Moscow, a unique problem arises related to the structure of its vehicle fleet, where there are two clusters that are weakly sensitive to any regulatory influences - official and personal cars, as well as cars of &quot;privileged&quot; users, the total number of which is at least 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of the vehicle fleet in Moscow).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential buildings, pavement area and the number of vehicles.
The main conclusions of the researchers: the city center is provided with two times less roads than required, and the majority of motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking lots, but car storage facilities, not to expand, but to reduce the carriageway (so that the streets become more pedestrian friendly), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal vehicles within the boundaries of the protected zone of the historical center (with a total area of about 3212 ha, covering a number of central areas of the city).
A tax maneuver will lead to a rise in the price of fuel, which provides for an increase in the mineral extraction tax (MET) on oil simultaneously with a decrease in export duties and an increase in excise taxes.
According to experts, these measures may bring additional RUB 619.3 billion to the budget.
Ride through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwellet Provides Free Rural Health Care in Cameroon
Bvelle and his team spend almost every weekend, seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country - only one in 5000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bvelle is one of the 10 main characters of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to become CNN Hero of the Year.
This person will receive $ 250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bvellet saw his father come back to life and fall into unconsciousness again, wandering through hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma, which reminded of itself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bvelle.
If we had the money, we would have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals for years, receiving whatever treatment they could get.
“It&#39;s not easy,” Bwelle said.
- You can leave home at 5 am, run to the hospital to be the first, but you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation hasn&#39;t changed much since Bvelle&#39;s father passed away in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor in 5,000 people.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor in 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of health care spending is private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
&quot;And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives.&quot;
Seeing the suffering of his father and so many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bvellet and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries.
He became a physician himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes weekend trips to the countryside to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others stuff vans, strap medical supplies to rooftops, and drive cross-country to visit villages in need.
They are not always lucky.
More than once they had to push cars across rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted like real heroes: a celebration of songs and dances and the best accommodations the locals have to offer.
The free medical care in these villages is truly cause for celebration, and Bvelle, with his wide smile and boundless energy, is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the team begins to see hundreds of patients.
“We host 500 people on every trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from all over the area within a 60-kilometer radius of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - documents needed for school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the team performs simple surgeries under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school building, municipality or home; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to light the operating room and sanitize equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It&#39;s an unbearable pace, but the team&#39;s sense of purpose is usually helped by the village musicians.
“They beat drums all night to keep us awake and keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the crew members head back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group of Cameroonian doctors and international medical students has performed 700 free surgeries over the past year, and they know their help can make a huge difference to those they help.
One person explained that the free hernia surgery he received would allow him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” the man said.
In addition to these weekend clinical appointments and hospital work, Bwelle&#39;s surgeon also works overnight in private medical clinics around Yaounde.
It is this second job, he says, that provides 60% of the funding for his non-profit organization; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don&#39;t even know when he sleeps,” said Katie O&#39;Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in the Bwelle group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses like O&#39;Malley coming from the US and Europe to join Bwelle in his mission, this is a practice opportunity that they would never have received at home.
“We were able to assist in surgeries where we helped remove blood stains or hold instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O&#39;Malley said.
As a sophomore, you would never get an opportunity like this in America.
Student volunteers usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But upon arrival in Yaounde, Bvelle pays for their food, transport and tuition.
“He&#39;s a hero, no doubt about it,” said O&#39;Malley.
He gives his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the almost constant workload is not an ordeal.
Helping others live a happy life, fulfilling the promise given to his father, is what brings him great joy.
“I&#39;m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle said.
- And I think about my father.
Hope he sees what I&#39;m doing.
I do this to make people laugh, to relieve their pain.

For the &quot;Russian mafia&quot; in the United States, a new name was finally entrenched - &quot;Brothers&#39; Circle&quot;
This week, the blacklist of the &quot;Russian mafia&quot; in America has been updated with new names and four companies.
The US Treasury Department has brought three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli into the &quot;Brotherly Circle&quot;.
One of the Russians turned out to be the famous singer Grigory Leps, whom the United States suspects of transporting money for members of the group.
All in all, there are 22 people on the US blacklist who are involved in the Brotherhood Circle, and six organizations affiliated with it.
Nevertheless, many experts express doubts that such an organization really exists.
“The Brothers Circle announcement is more like an attempt to unite scattered criminal groups,” said Mark Galeotti, an organized crime expert and professor at New York University.
In his opinion, &quot;Brothers&#39; Circle&quot; reflects the popular perception of the &quot;Russian mafia&quot;.
&quot;I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement or elsewhere who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,&quot; the US Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime quoted Mr. Galeotti as saying.
George Mason University professor Liz Shelley agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
&quot;If they act together, it looks more like a criminal network, but not an organization,&quot; the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime quoted her as saying.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the Brothers&#39; Circle unites to a greater extent the close associates of the Russian thief in law Aslan Usoyan, known as Ded Khasan.
The crime boss was killed in January this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zakhary Kalashov, who joined the list in 2012, were closely associated with Ded Khasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was Ded Khasan&#39;s nephew.
Nevertheless, Mr. Galeotti notes that some individuals have nothing to do with Usoyan.
In his opinion, all of them were united rather by common financial and criminal interests, for example, the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Grigory Leps, the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the Brotherly Circle, has drawn the Kremlin&#39;s attention.
Naturally, we expect that we will receive more detailed information from our American colleagues-partners, in connection with which such a decision was made, why it was included in such lists, - said the press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
Just like the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
Tony Blair said he would seize the chance to return as UK Prime Minister, but admits a return is unlikely.
Last night, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since stepping down in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the four Middle East peacekeepers.
Asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, Blair said, &quot;Yes, of course, but this is unlikely to happen, so ...&quot; according to the London Evening Standard.
Milan head coach Massimiliano Allegri has expressed regret over the draw in the match of the 10th round of the Italian championship with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start are due to a series of injuries of the leading players.
I am very sorry that we did not manage to win, - quotes Tmw as saying Allegri.
The team played a solid match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn’t allow Lazio to do anything.
In the second, the Romans added, but in general I cannot say that we have lost concentration.
It was necessary to win.
Last season, we completed our goal of qualifying for the Champions League.
Now we are behind schedule, but this is due to a whole series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players with character.
However, our roster is still good.
Take a look at Kaka who hosted the high-level meeting.
British Police Serve Assange with Extradition Notice
British police today handed an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard said they had given the 40-year-old Australian a &quot;formal demand to surrender&quot; to the police station, adding that if this requirement is not met, he will continue to be subject to arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on sex crimes charges after exhausting his options under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, on June 19 he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, asking this South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard &quot;has given the 40-year-old man a formal surrender demand that obliges him to arrive at the police station on a day and time of our choice,&quot; a spokesman said.
He continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the notice to the police.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States on possible espionage charges following the publication of more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel &quot;Eltyshevs&quot;, translated into French.
Let us remind you that it was this novel of his that won four awards: Yasnaya Polyana, Russian Booker, National Bestseller and Big Book.
And last year the writer was awarded the prize of the government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture for this book.
Roman Senchin is the undoubted leader in the generation of today&#39;s thirty and forty-year-old prose writers.
Almost every publication of his tough stories and novellas, built on modern life material, causes heated debate among critics of various directions.
It can be argued that the articles on prose and journalism of Senchin, collected together, reviews of his books and journal publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In discussions about the works of &quot;one of the most controversial modern writers&quot;, according to the critic Sergei Chuprinin, most of the discussion is about what its participants understand by the word &quot;literature&quot;, how they see the present and future not only of our literature, but also of life ...
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow to include most of the articles and reviews from the regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are given, as a rule, in abbreviations in the sections &quot;Paragraphs ...&quot;
Snowden may be interrogated in Russia
Former American intelligence officer Edward Snowden will most likely not travel outside Russia to testify in cases of wiretapping of German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s telephone conversations.
A source familiar with the situation told Interfax on Friday that the American can answer questions from representatives of the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office of Germany in writing or in person in Russia.
Departure of Edward Snowden outside of Russia is practically impossible.
&quot;In this case, he will lose his refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by the countries - allies of the United States,&quot; the agency&#39;s interlocutor said.
&quot;At the same time, in principle, the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office of the Federal Republic of Germany could send its representatives to the Russian Federation or pass written questions to Snowden,&quot; the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, the deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele said that Edward Snowden was ready to testify in the case of wiretapping by the American special services of the talks of the German Chancellor.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in Germany.
The ex-CIA officer made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the US NSA has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, for this it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival, &quot;Strebele told Euronews.
Snowden&#39;s lawyer Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement of the Interfax source, said that his client can cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he will decide for himself.
US citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information about the secret operations of the US intelligence services on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport due to the fact that his passport was canceled by the US authorities, which brought serious charges against him in absentia, and until early August remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a period of one year and left Sheremetyevo on the same day.
Yesterday, the American&#39;s lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said that his client got a job in a &quot;large Russian company.&quot;
The NSA surveillance of Angela Merkel was reported by German media last week.
According to journalists, Americans began to wiretap the Chancellor&#39;s telephone conversations back in 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly located at the US Embassy in Berlin.
After the publication of this information, the German authorities said that the surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Land Rover Racing Series Announced
Inside are racing seats and six-point harnesses, as well as an intercom system.
In addition, you can get upgraded brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: &quot;The rally participants who go to Bowler have changed.&quot;
Some are not experienced riders, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are delighted to offer this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to experience different rally disciplines in the UK and overseas, and prepare competitors for the challenging conditions and realities of rally-raid.
It was with great pleasure that we developed the Defender Challenge car - it will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge includes one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to take part in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Children should learn myths and legends as &quot;lifestyle models,&quot; says the author.
The tales of Thor might show that &quot;brute force cannot defeat subtle cunning,&quot; and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will turn out to be “too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to be taught in schools,” Crossley-Holland advocates “careful selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it&#39;s wonderful that in America myth and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have advocated introducing them into the curriculum for twenty years.
He added that the &quot;over-moralizing&quot; of authors and teachers &quot;discourages interest&quot; from children, and the main ideas are &quot;sublimated&quot; into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and also wrote A Collection of Norse Myths for Penguin and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have intentions, but you better keep them. with me&quot;.
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer writing for adults and an adult writer writing for children is the need to feel some sort of hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there is an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly articulated.
Old principle: show, not tell.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of growing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
First of all, this is the crisis of non-payment of unsecured consumer loans and massive layoffs of workers.
Our main concern right now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of that growth.
Recently, it has been entirely driven by consumption, which has hardly slowed down, &quot;said Clemens Grafé, chief economist at Goldman Sachs for Russia, presenting the investment bank&#39;s quarterly report on the Russian economy yesterday.
Now the nominal growth of wages in Russia is about 10%.
With inflation of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at roughly current levels, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so, most likely, they will focus on optimizing personnel costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, - explained Mr. Grafe.
Companies have faced declining margins.
If it does not grow, it can lead to layoffs and an increase in unemployment.
Russian business cannot but raise wages, says Vladimir Pantyushin, chief economist at Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS.
Unemployment is near historic lows, and competition for workers is high.
In order to lure outside employees or keep the current ones, employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia is also supported by a very rapid growth in consumer lending.
According to Mr. Grafe, this type of lending does not have a multiplier effect on the country&#39;s economy due to extremely high rates on consumer loans.
&quot;We did not see any benefits for the economy from the growth of consumer lending, the money does not go through the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments,&quot; the economist said.
But the problem is different - Goldman Sachs expects an increase in delinquency on unsecured loans.
They are taken mostly by poor people who have nothing to provide as security.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are often not returned, &quot;said Mr. Grafe.
Therefore, the second threat to economic growth in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payment of unsecured loans.
Vasily Solodkov, director of the HSE Banking Institute, already sees signs of a looming banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, not having access to cheap resources, which state banks have, were forced to attract funds from the population at high interest rates.
In response, state banks went on the warpath and began to reduce lending rates, - continues the economist.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If state banks do not give up dumping, Russia will face a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The economist considers the revocation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks to be a harbinger of a massive collapse.
&quot;The state banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was not originally designed for a systemic crisis,&quot; warns the head of the institute.
But the growth of consumption will slow down even without the crisis of non-payments, the investment bank believes, due to the refusal to index the salaries of civil servants and military personnel, which is included in the current version of the draft budget.
The blow to consumption will be partially mitigated by the freezing of tariffs by natural monopolies (and, as a consequence, by lower inflation).
But only partially: if investments do not grow (and there are no prerequisites for this yet - see the reference), consumption growth will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is sure.
Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
&quot;The main risk is still a drop in oil prices,&quot; he says.
According to him, the Russian economy will begin to shrink when oil prices are below $ 90 per barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
A paradoxical picture is observed: inflation has decreased, and banks have begun to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to inflation targeting, &quot;said Clemens Grafe.
The interest rate policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, only affects the rates of interbank lending.
&quot;For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hopes,&quot; said Clemens Grafe.
The money received at the Central Bank&#39;s auctions is used by banks not for lending to the economy, but for managing their liquidity
As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate immediately changes, which means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the ruble.
&quot;Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work,&quot; said Mr. Grafe and recalled that the state plans to let the ruble &quot;float freely&quot; by the end of 2015.
But we will either have to do it earlier, or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he said.
According to him, the ruble exchange rate is now artificially overvalued by 10%.
There is only one way to ruble - to weaken, - the expert concludes.
But if the Central Bank sows in the financiers even a shadow of doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of a policy to weaken the ruble, this could bring down the ruble much more.
Snowden agreed to testify about wiretapping of Merkel
Bundestag member Hans-Christian Strebele met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the conversation, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be interrogated as a witness by the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office of the Federal Republic of Germany in the case of a possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor&#39;s phone by the US special services.
Snowden expressed his readiness to give the necessary evidence.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, - said Hans-Christian Strebele, - that he knows a lot.
And even though Keith Alexander&#39;s National Security Agency has blocked all of his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first you need to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival. ...
Meanwhile, US lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the US spyware scandal.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the US electronic intelligence agency.
FAA: &quot;Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not call from a mobile phone)&quot;
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not talk on their mobile phones, according to long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers shouldn&#39;t expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary by airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft are meeting the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and stowage regulations to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on airplanes.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve an increase in the use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane door closes.
They should not restart them until the aircraft reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives the go-ahead.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane descends for landing, and do not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Flight Attendants Association, welcomed the change.
“Once the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win,” said Glading.
We are frankly tired of feeling like “school attendants” when it comes to this issue.
But Internet connections for surfing, e-mailing, texting or downloading data will still be banned below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be prompted to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
Thus, there are still no Words with Friends, an intellectual Internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when a sensational incident occurred: the actor was removed from an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off the device. the time the plane was at the gate.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be stowed in the luggage compartment, as they can injure someone if they fly around the cabin.
In-flight calls from a mobile phone will also continue to be prohibited.
Regulatory authority over phone calls rests with the FCC, not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board and national transportation safety expert for CBS News said last month that cell phones are still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they have the potential to interfere with navigation devices, but we know from the FCC that they can interfere with cell towers when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee, set up by the FAA to look into the matter, recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, there has been mounting pressure on the FAA to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill argue that there is no compelling security reason for the bans.
Compliance is also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting passenger use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communications equipment, when passengers began carrying around FM radios, the high-tech gadgets of the day.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also being developed and approved by the FAA to be immune to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for several years.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more immune to interference.
The vast majority of liners are geared towards wider electronic use under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today&#39;s electronic devices typically emit radio signals at a much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal signals when flipping through pages.
But signals become more powerful when devices are downloading or sending data.
Among those pushing for relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, company officials loaded an entire airliner with their Kindle e-readers and flew around to check for problems, but never found them.
FAA advisory committee members expressed mixed feelings about whether the devices present any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passengers Association said he considers interference from devices to be real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only sporadic reports from pilots confirming that devices can interfere with aircraft systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to require passengers to disable devices during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A travel industry group hailed the change, calling it a sensible move to accommodate passengers who now use a variety of technological devices.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Doe, CEO of the United States Travel Association.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of trying to slander the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the countries of the Eastern Partnership - this statement was made to the BNS agency by the republic&#39;s state security department (DGB).
Information about this is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to &quot;slander&quot; Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archives, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the information attack is being prepared by the Department for Analysis of Public Processes of the Administration of the President of Russia for Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania more than once and took part in the congress of the Lithuanian People&#39;s Party.
Also a participant in the operation is allegedly a department employee V. Smirnov.
According to the secret service, Smirnov, under the guise of scientific work, until the end of 2012, regularly came to Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnov is now banned from entering the country.
On the eve, the President of Lithuania Grybauskaite announced that she knew about the informatics being prepared for her.
In her opinion, the main reasons are the successful presidency of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and &quot;the country&#39;s striving for energy independence&quot;
The Lithuanian leader has repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she said that the Kremlin treats Lithuania &quot;insufficiently respectful.&quot;
In addition, Grybauskaite accused the head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin of putting forward &quot;only demands&quot; to Lithuania.
Recall that in September Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian &quot;milk&quot; to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the products did not meet the sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Then the leader of Lithuania said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the country&#39;s government should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could rob the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell College of Medicine in New York said the first results were encouraging.
“We really hope that this vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying every method on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with these modern remedies.” Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry the genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies track down any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing smokers from getting a nicotine hit.
In tests, vaccinated mice that were subsequently given nicotine continued their normal activities.
And mice that were not given the vaccine &quot;relaxed,&quot; a sign that the nicotine was reaching their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have failed because they contained antibodies.
To keep antibody levels high, injections had to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they have the urge to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not get the pleasure of the nicotine vaccine, and this can help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
The British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research was needed.

Frontier Airlines will charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $ 100 for carrying carry-on luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $ 100 for carry-on luggage and $ 2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday said passengers could keep the entire can.
The new carry-on charge applies to overhead bags, so small under-seat bags will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $ 100 if travelers only pay when they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Keith O&#39;Malley said the $ 100 fee should force passengers to pay in advance.
“We don&#39;t want to charge you for this,” she said.
Airlines began charging fees for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges are stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage in overhead compartments, which often results in limited space in these compartments.
Fees are one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O&#39;Malley said this new collection is not really about making money.
The fact is that Frontier&#39;s most loyal customers say overhead storage is getting harder to find.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline&#39;s website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the exit of a Frontier flight can carry a bag for free, while the next passenger in line can pay $ 100 for the same bag.
O&#39;Malley said the change to procedures on the Frontier website and check-in counters is intended to ensure that passengers are aware of collection before they arrive at the gate.
The new Frontier carry-on tax will not start levying until summer, although a date has yet to be set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money and passengers who need this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most of them did not concern hand luggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first carry-on charge three years ago, and another discounter, Allegiant Air, later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a charge is Hungary&#39;s Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring the surcharge.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit&#39;s carry-on luggage collection brings in $ 50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former executive at Midwest Airlines, recently flew a Spirit flight and wondered what he would find at the gate when passengers were faced with Spirit&#39;s unusual carry-on charge.
“The landing process was the smoothest I&#39;ve seen in my airline career,” he said.
I expected to see teeth gnashing and a fight at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, &quot;and the landing was swift.&quot;
Frontier also follows Spirit for a $ 2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who receive soda or juice can keep the entire can and that coffee refills will be provided free of charge.
She will continue to distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to charge drinks in 2008, but dropped it seven months later, after passengers began to complain and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier&#39;s initiative to charge hand luggage, where passengers don&#39;t buy tickets directly from the airline, is its latest move to drive customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers like Orbitz between $ 10 and $ 25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, it began giving half the frequent flyer miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she slashed her award miles to 25 percent of her trip miles.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip with the Frontier purchased from an online travel agency would have earned 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only select their seat in advance if they buy tickets directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.
Revenue was down 9 percent and flight capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to fix Frontier&#39;s finances as part of an airline sale.
Putin achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now - news from overseas, namely - from Syria, where, as we learned today, Israel struck Russian-made missiles, which were reportedly destined for Hezbollah.
Today Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its chemical weapons production by November 1.
This was done as part of an agreement brokered by Russia that prevented the United States from carrying out a military operation, which it came close to this summer.
For more information on weapons and what it all means for the Syrian president, our Chief International Correspondent Richard Engel will tell you more.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal arranged by Assad&#39;s friend, Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria has disabled the declared factories for the production of chemical weapons.
A more long-term and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components for them.
As we understand it, this is about a thousand tons.
Earlier, Washington said that Assad&#39;s days were numbered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and must leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are disunited and poorly armed.
Its people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe Bashar al-Assad escaped punishment for the massacre.
The chemical weapons agreement has been called a diplomatic success, inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has made the impression of a person willing to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the US Ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, his mother is hardly better off not being killed with chemical weapons.
Assad is holding on for now.
And exchanges weapons for power.
Tomich will work 240 hours for an extremist video on a social network
The Leninsky District Court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of compulsory work a resident of the city who posted an extremist video on a social network, a spokesman for the regional court&#39;s press service told RIA Novosti on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page on the popular social network, which was included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was initiated against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation &quot;Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as humiliation of human dignity, committed in public.&quot;
&quot;The Leninsky District Court considered this case in a special order and found the man guilty of committing the above crime, sentencing him to 240 hours of compulsory work,&quot; said the agency&#39;s interlocutor.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Parents of intersex children can choose &quot;undefined gender&quot;
Germany became the first European country to recognize third sex in babies born with intermediate genitalia.
Newborns will no longer be necessarily male or female.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate gender as “undefined” or “unidentified” on their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to relieve pressure on parents to make hasty decisions about sex assignment of newborns and to counter discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said many years later, &quot;I&#39;m not a man or a woman.&quot;
I will remain a doctor-made patchwork with bruises and scars.
About one in two thousand children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of &quot;impaired sexual development&quot; - a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes), or unusually developed external genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all. ...
New York City psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law &quot;sounds like a good idea.&quot;
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children don&#39;t,” he said.
You can assign a gender without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the questions about why this is happening.
It&#39;s like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, as their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typical of both at the same time or not typical for any of them.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sex characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts, and physique; primary sex characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys with gender disabilities now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put male, female or third gender on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian resident Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to be recognized as &quot;sexless&quot;, defending in court the right to maintain &quot;indeterminate&quot; sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third designation in addition to M and F - X, that is, intersex.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, a highly Catholic country, signed a petition to remove &quot;gender theory&quot; from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also disagreed with German law, writing that &quot;in a situation where the world is being pulled into a new state where sex is a matter of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization.&quot;
One mother of a newborn baby in Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would rather have babies assigned gender at birth.
“Raising a child is hard enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don&#39;t know the gender of your child,” she told a parenting website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites, after the beautiful Greek god who had the characteristics of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which you can erase everything and then paint again.
But now, many are challenging the ethical basis for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive the assigned gender when they grow up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a &#39;psychiatric emergency,&#39;” Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you didn&#39;t call the psychiatrist - you called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to handle children with intermediate genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily changeable.
He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that environmental signals, including social signals - how parents raise a child - interact with a child&#39;s genes and hormones, determining whether a person considers himself a man or a woman.
But in one 1966 case known as &quot;John / Joan,&quot; his theories were called into question.
He advised the parents of a boy, whose penis had been damaged during a careless circumcision, to completely castrate the child, removing his testicles as well, and raise him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of a transition, but that was not the case,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that now some doctors are still &quot;applying this model.&quot;
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these sex reassignment surgeries declared themselves &quot;dissatisfied with the outcome.&quot;
Such was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but intermediate genitals.
The doctors could not determine for sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live the &quot;full life&quot; of a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce&#39;s external penis and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I was not a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he was prescribed vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he learned was terrible.
I was spayed at birth and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a developmental disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
Upon learning the truth, he became a man again, receiving testosterone shots and removing his breasts.
The operation rendered him sterile.
Today he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based legal association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law &quot;encourages labeling and stigma.&quot;
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give their child an &#39;undefined gender&#39;,” she said.
We are afraid that he will facilitate the intervention.
We think it&#39;s best to assign a male or female gender and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law as &quot;it allows adults to choose the third sex.&quot;
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender,” she says.
German law implies its appropriation at birth.
This is a battle that young children should not get involved in at this stage.
When they grow up, then they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baraz, a Pittsburgh-based mammologist-radiologist who has a sexually impaired daughter who is helping hundreds of others in the support group, said German law would &quot;support&quot; both parents and children.
Baraz&#39;s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a developmental disorder called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are not working properly, Katie developed female symptoms.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now, at 29 years old, Katie is married and is pursuing a residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite being infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves,” Barats said.
He gives them time to do some analysis and sort out the situation, as well as a period of time before they write &quot;masculine&quot; or &quot;feminine.&quot;
In this case, you are fine - raising a child, love a child.
You have a wonderful child and you feel joy.
We do not need to hastily perform an operation that is irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in the decision and removes the anxiety that drives parents because they don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide which gender he or she is more comfortable with - and that&#39;s great.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
US Secretary of State: intelligence agencies sometimes &quot;went too far&quot; in collecting data
US Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that in collecting data and wiretapping, the American special services sometimes &quot;went too far,&quot; nevertheless, the politician noted that the information that appeared in the media about the wiretapping of 70 million people does not correspond to reality.
I assure you that innocent people were not harmed during this process, but there was an attempt to collect information.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was illegal.
I admit it, as the President admits ... and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future, &quot;- quotes the AFP Secretary of State.
Equestrian experts traveling to Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year prize knew the competition would be fierce.
But no one was ready for the arrival of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, who just a few months before had made his first steps, this kid with his pet Shetland pony Toffee trotted through three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple - of equal height - have received high marks for appearance, demeanor and style in the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Center in Radri, near Cardiff.
Standing out in front of the crowd of men and women in elegant bowler hats, he pulled his cap to one side and proudly walked around two-year-old Toffee.
The judges praised Fenton for his precocious innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffee received the highest marks for appearance and character.
Fenton was given Toffee for his third birthday last March and has been practicing with the Shetland pony every day since then.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said: &quot;Fenton and Toffee make a great duet.&quot;
They had many rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second gig with Toffee and we were all thrilled when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for over 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, &quot;The entire audience was amazed and everyone shouted cheers and clapped.&quot;
He ran along the sand along the entire length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, he did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens to take care of.
Judging by the way he started, he will soon be taking part in &quot;Horse of the Year&quot; - and I&#39;m sure he will perform well.
A spokesman for this annual equestrian show said, &quot;Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony.&quot;
Together they are a great team.
The judges commended Fenton and Toffee for their looks and for the way they presented themselves in the show ring.
They appreciate the coherence of the pony and the breeder - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I&#39;m sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he looked really good in his role.
A regular bus turned over in Altai.
In the Rubtsovsky district of the Altai Territory, the PAZ regular bus turned over.
As a result of the road accident, according to the specified data, 13 people were injured, the regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations said.
Earlier, law enforcement agencies in the region reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred at about 9 am local time on the Novonikolaevka-Vishnevka highway, 1 kilometer from Novonikolaevka.
There were 12 passengers and a driver on the bus going from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka, all were injured of varying severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were delivered to the City Hospital No. 1 of Rubtsovsk, two people were hospitalized in the Central Regional Hospital of Rubtsovsk.
Court Suspends Execution of Stop-and-Search Judgment at New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals suspended enforcement of a court order requiring changes to the NYPD&#39;s stop-and-search program and removed the judge from the case.
The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that the execution of Judge Shira Sheindlin&#39;s decisions would be suspended pending the outcome of an appeal filed by the city.
In August, a judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in how it carried out a program of street arrests and interrogations.
The city has filed an appeal against its decision and corrective action orders, including an order to appoint a supervisor to help the police department change its operating practices and associated training program.
On Thursday, the appellate court heard the pleadings of the parties on the motion to suspend the case.
The appellate court called for the judge to be challenged because she violated the US judicial code of conduct and did not consider the need to avoid displaying bias, in part due to a series of media interviews and official statements that publicly responded to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably addressing blacks and Hispanics under a stop-and-search program.
It appointed an external overseer to oversee large-scale changes that include policy, training and oversight reforms, and decided to launch a pilot program to test body-mounted video cameras in police stations where most arrests occur.
In August, New York decided to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were dropped after a police check.
The City&#39;s appeal hearing is due after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-search tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
Search stop has been practiced for decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has skyrocketed under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an all-time record of 684,330 in 2011, most of whom are blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four people, all from national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of the stop-and-search program changes at the New York City Police Department say the changes will end bad practices, create a more reliable and effective police service, and could affect how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that the change will reduce police morale, not crime, waste money, and fail to address the broader problem of difficult police conditions, with a few thousand fewer officers over the past decade.
The judge noted that she does not stop the practice of stop-and-search, which is consistent with the constitution, but is changing the way the New York police stop people.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse in prices for goods after the signing of an association with the European Union
Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will drop significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He stated this in the course of communication with the readers of his page on &quot;Facebook&quot;.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provisions on the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on the import of goods from the EU will significantly decrease.
And this will mean that prices should also go down.
&quot;This is with regard to goods that come from EU countries,&quot; Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
But, nevertheless, there should be no price increase there either.
Therefore, the messages on billboards, which have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that the association with the EU means a rise in prices is not entirely true, or, to be more precise, not at all, &quot;Azarov summed up.
$ 325 Million Rescue Package for Tasmania Healthcare
The federal government insists that the $ 325 million rescue package for Tasmania&#39;s weakened health care system will be complemented by stringent conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking &quot;urgent action&quot; to stave off a crisis caused by the island state&#39;s aging population, higher rates of chronic disease and systemic constraints.
The funding decision for four years was made after government consultations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific problems facing the state,” Ms Plibersek said today.
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million for the planned operations blitz campaign.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic and cataract surgeries, will help bridge the gap.
There is also money for out-of-appointment clinics in Hobart and Launceston, to improve the quality of post-hospital care, train healthcare professionals, mental health services, and implement personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
“This investment will go towards the ideas expressed by leading doctors on how best to help Tasmania&#39;s health care system,” said Ms Plibersek.
The minister insisted that the Tasmanian government would operate under strict accountability and responsibility.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report on a monthly basis where it spends this additional funds.
A three-person panel will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Wilkie said today that $ 325 million will not solve anything &quot;unless it is followed by genuine reform that puts Tasmania&#39;s health care system on a more sustainable footing.&quot;
Nonetheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first approached the prime minister with in early May.
“I hope the federal aid package will go a long way towards bringing this state&#39;s health care system out of critical condition,” said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional selective procedures largely offset the recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today&#39;s announcement is &quot;a plaster-like solution.&quot;
“The reason we are here is because the state Labor government has snatched $ 430 million from the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
With the state government making nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth putting in 300 million, you can&#39;t pretend it&#39;s good news.
Mr Dutton asked Ms Plibersek to ensure that none of the bailout dollar was spent on additional bureaucracy.
Obama&#39;s voter cry of despair
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope that change is possible
He says Obama allowed Republican obstructionism to undermine commendable efforts.
Obstructionism Cannot Excuse Problems with Obama Reforming Healthcare Website, Drone Attacks
The Obama campaign memoir 2008 is a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a sophomore at Harvard University School of Medicine.
I am reading a terribly sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me during the discouragement of my sophomore year of medical school and rekindle a sense of hope in me.
It&#39;s called “Insolence to Win,” and it&#39;s a memoir from Barack Obama&#39;s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients in the evening and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could be breathtaking.
The election victory was impressive, and news anchors paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents took care of every newspaper they could find.
A young team of strategists was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his support rate was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a rude awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It&#39;s hard to remember those days of optimism - they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, change has indeed taken place.
It was something that I could not even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and varied accomplishments, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Law to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the lifting of the Don&#39;t Ask, Don&#39;t Tell rule, and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choices, and the closure of the Guantanamo base, among others.
But after countless times when I have sided with the Obama administration, defending it in front of colleagues and peers, I have run out of explanations I can provide.
I have reached the point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain allowing foreign leaders to wiretap or drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain the National Security Agency&#39;s collection of data on American privacy or the pursuit of whistleblowers who expose government misconduct.
He cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial or investigation, or failure to comply with government funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the findings of the report, which says the White House efforts to silence the media are &quot;the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.&quot;
And lately, he has been unable to justify failing to develop a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.
I don&#39;t know if I should have expected this.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that leadership can be in conflict with the political campaigns that precede it?
Obviously, running in an elected office is not a predictable program of action, since our public dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and random events such as the Newtown massacre.
Nevertheless, all the examples I listed above show that they were largely the administration&#39;s own choice.
And this is what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented an incomprehensible and crude alternative, it seemed that he was not able to decide on his own policies or views.
I believed that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, would live up to the hopes we had heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama&#39;s approval rating dropped below 45% this week, it has become much more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me yearn for the many promises that have fizzled out.
This week I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton defeated Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a failure review meeting, he told his employees that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their goal.
“I want us to bring back our appeal,” he said.
&quot;We must remember who we are.&quot;
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
The opinions expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Egypt&#39;s first freely elected president is sworn in
Muhammad Mursi is sworn in, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot; when he took the oath of office, becoming the country&#39;s first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office in front of 18 judges in black robes at a courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been a banned organization for most of its 84 years. , which served as a target for tough actions of successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police officers when Mursi arrived with a small cortege shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp of Mubarak&#39;s time, traffic was only briefly stopped to allow his convoy to pass along the normally busy road connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi was ridiculed as the Brothers&#39; uncharismatic spare tire, his personal prestige has grown dramatically since his victory and Friday&#39;s speech in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists, but also for all those who want to see the case through. the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit and red tie, told judges in the wood-paneled courtroom where he took the oath.
Later, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with the army band playing the national anthem, during which he stood at attention.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was greeted with the slogan &quot;Army and people - one hand&quot;, which was chanted by hundreds of those gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold for Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath of office Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak&#39;s authoritarian rule last year, and has pledged to return the presidential powers that had been stripped of his office by a military council that took over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court, and not before the parliament, as is customary, he fulfills the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi&#39;s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Schools called for more emphasis on math, spelling and grammar
School English Literature courses will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction beginning in 1914.
The exam will also feature “extra-curricular texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined English literature and language course will be canceled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a separate final language exam, with strong recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is due to release new curricula tomorrow in English and math, the first subjects to be radically overhauled.
He will be making changes to other major items next year.
Separately, the OFQUAL examinations regulator will present a revised high school graduation exam structure, with a new grading system and less coursework.
Speaking over the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was &quot;broad consensus that we need to reform our exam system to restore public confidence,&quot; insisting that school leaving exams will be &quot;harder, more ambitious and more rigorous.&quot;
Research shows that English schools devote less time to math (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours per year, while in Singapore students study about 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on the math schedule, coalition sources said large school graduation exams in math, coupled with a higher score on the ranking table, would likely act as an incentive for schools to provide additional instruction in the subject.
The curriculum will focus more on “real life problems,” including financial mathematics.
Is football a cause of strife?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the Open Tribune, politicians and experts talked about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was the following: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because this game is nothing but scandals and strife.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulevo and said that in order to reduce the &quot;degree of tension in society,&quot; politicians and the media must be correct in their statements.
Probably, he was referring to the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV programs threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire if they did not want to limit the birth rate there ...
All the speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and about measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which made the discussion muddy.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulyovo were &quot;a model conflict that could have been predicted,&quot; but &quot;we have too many people and authorities responsible for these questions,&quot; and seven nannies have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has been practicing with regard to migrants for a long time, has failed, according to the public figure, and we must look for our own way.
Historian Yuri Petrov has high hopes for a new unified history textbook.
&quot;We also need to create a manual on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa,&quot; he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to introduce criminal liability for &quot;calls for the dismemberment of Russia&quot;: &quot;If you say on the radio in the US that Alaska should be given to Russia, then you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!&quot;
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to &quot;kindle&quot;.
As usual, he blamed the journalists for everything, who bring sick and acute national problems to public discussion: &quot;In the heat of polemics, you never know what can be said!&quot;
The leader of the United Russia faction, Vladimir Vasiliev, immediately advised journalists to conclude a &quot;charter&quot; and agree to conduct conversations on this topic carefully, and then politicians can take on the same obligations.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order is generally established, said Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he cited a law that makes regional and municipal authorities responsible for interethnic peace on their territory.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko was not enthusiastic about this law: it does not have &quot;clear ideas about what adaptation of migrants is, about its mechanisms and limits.
This means that the subjects will interpret the scope of these powers differently.
In addition, the municipalities do not have the personnel necessary to solve such complex issues, they do not have the funds, and the center does not give them methodological recommendations that they could use ...
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities Affairs Gadzhimet Safaraliev proposed creating a special department with the formidable name &quot;Ministry of National Security&quot;, which would deal with issues of nationality policy.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 90s headed a similar department, which was later abolished, opposed it.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, a “minister without a portfolio,” to whom one could turn, if anything.
“We are walking along the edge, shells are bursting nearby, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to oppose provocations together, and this work should receive worthy informational support,” said Vsevolod Chaplin, a representative of the Russian Orthodox Church for public relations.
In his opinion, there should not be any neutrality of the state in relation to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones.
Here Oleg Nilov took the discussion into an unexpected direction: &quot;More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan still need to be looked for, but they are being pushed on the wrong path, on the wrong road,&quot; he said.
&quot;The wrong road&quot; is the development of football: &quot;Either a football player is beaten by the whole crowd, now they burn flags, then comrades throw stones at each other ...

NSA confessions fuel corporate paranoia over government surveillance
On a warm afternoon in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany&#39;s financial capital.
On instructions from the Federal Constitutional Defense Service (BfV), Germany&#39;s internal intelligence service, his task was to photograph the roof of the US mission building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to find the antennae of the eavesdropping devices, a move that prompted talks between the US and the German Foreign Office in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of US National Intelligence, reaffirmed in September that the US is not using foreign intelligence &quot;to steal trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of US companies, to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.&quot;
But since Edward Snowden - a contract employee turned whistleblower - began publishing his treasure trove of US intelligence secrets, European governments and corporate executives are no longer sure if the director&#39;s word can be taken.
Reports that the US National Security Agency was monitoring the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gaining access to data held by US cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised corporate paranoia caused by government surveillance to new heights.
The last straw was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s phone had been tapped for perhaps about ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe can be targeted, then of course business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden made evident the intense collaboration between US intelligence services and companies.
I think it is likely that this data is being used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents Germany&#39;s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the US now poses almost the same risk as China in the area of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
In all of the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, there has so far been no evidence that the United States has transferred trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain capabilities in the areas of information technology and the Internet, and suggested that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says that we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
“It&#39;s not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German business software provider SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it shouldn&#39;t have been allowed to perish more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Yet the reach and technical sophistication of US espionage agencies made famous by Snowden&#39;s revelations came as a shock to some companies, which previously thought China was the biggest risk of surveillance.
A big shift is taking place in cloud computing, where European CEOs have become more aware that data stored in the US is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by the Cloud Security Alliance trade association, about 10 percent of its non-US members have abandoned plans to use the services of a US-based cloud provider following the exposure of US data mining software Prism.
Jim Snabe, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: &quot;We see consumers asking a new question that did not arise a year ago, namely, where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction.&quot;
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are just confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore this data must be protected at all costs.
Economic espionage is not surprising.
It has always been the case.
“This has been a topic of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us commercially and industrially, and we spy on them too, because it is in our national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to brag about the retaliation they have taken, as this can provide an advantage to the enemy.
Large companies have long adopted the idea that taking a free USB flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is, to say the least, imprudent.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the carmaker Audi, says it has been standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
Germany&#39;s Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution recommends that company executives consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently thrown away.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacks and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world market leaders in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” warns in the BfV report.
The US is warning its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
A US national intelligence report in February ranked France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second tier of economic intelligence hackers after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, &quot;the French are the worst.&quot;
Bernard Scarsini, the former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: &quot;The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.&quot;
Los Angeles International Airport was evacuated due to shooting at one of the terminals.
An unknown man opened fire in the third terminal at 09.30 local time on Friday, November 1 (20.30 Moscow time).
The guards evacuated the staff and passengers of the second and third terminals.
According to preliminary data, the man was firing a high-power rifle.
Several people, including a US Transportation Safety Officer, were injured.
The police returned fire and detained the attacker.
He is lightly injured.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labor Secretary Joe Tripody will be involved in an investigation by the state&#39;s anti-corruption watchdog.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied a change to the seaside lease at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned stakes in three properties on state land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr Obeid had lobbied several state ministers to renew leases for Sercular Key, where the Obeid family own two restaurants and cafes, without going through a bid after their expiration date. in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripody was aware of Mr. Obeid&#39;s secret involvement in real estate, following testimony given by Mr. Tripody&#39;s former deputy chief of staff Lynn Ashpole on Thursday.
For several years of discussions that began in 2005, the government insisted that rentals be put up for open competition.
The tenants were against this and also wanted longer leases.
In 2009, the lease agreements for the Cercular Key businesses, which brought in about $ 2.5 million a year for the Obeid family, were renewed without being put up for open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated for open tenders.
But he denied that the changes were made at the behest of Mr. Obeid, who Mr. Tripodi acknowledged was strongly advising changes to the government&#39;s rental policy.
The phone transcripts provided by ICAC cited conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr Obaid, Mr Tripody and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Ports Department after working under Mr Obaid in the Fisheries Department.
&quot;Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations a question of the development of a commercial lease policy?&quot; Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wiley asked Mr. Tripody.
“No,” Mr. Tripodi replied. -
I can&#39;t remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not the case.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
UN announces new targets for poverty reduction
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in moving the Sustainable Development Goals to replace the MDGs, which are due to expire in 2015, ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit that kicked off in Rio de Janeiro the night before.
They were included in the final version of the document, which will be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told the summit last night that now is the time &quot;to rise above national interests.&quot;
“I am glad that UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating universal sustainable development goals - SDGs,” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will make every effort to use the mandate given to me by member countries to implement our vision of sustainable development goals that are underpinned by the successful achievement of the MDGs.
A new line of expenses will appear in the utility bills of Voronezh residents - deductions for major repairs of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact standard will be determined by the regional government.
But when to paint the staircase, tidy up the stairwells or even replace the elevator - the tenants themselves will decide.
Such a law was approved by the deputies of the regional duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: &quot;In this matter, we also need to establish order - to establish the sequence of overhaul of houses, to accumulate funds not in management companies - which we often register now in Moscow, now in Orenburg, or elsewhere, it will be the establishment of state control over the spending of funds that residents collect for the repair of apartment buildings. &quot;
Shared construction is now under the control of the state.
The law protecting against fraudsters was approved by the Regional Duma in the final reading.
The document was not born from scratch.
In our region, 4,500 people have suffered from dishonest developers.
Most of the problems were solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes the rights and obligations for all participants in shared construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: “It&#39;s no secret that abuse has also begun in this area, due to the fact that in 1998 the same equity holders got in, and in the 2000s the same equity holders. &quot;
People began to make money on it to close the loophole, including the adoption of these two laws.
It was decided to build a temporary residence center for foreign citizens subject to deportation near Voronezh.
The regional parliament adopted such a law not only under pressure from the federation.
There are more than enough problems related to illegal migrants in the region.
So, in the past year, a little more than 100 thousand foreigners got registered for migration.
But only one in five has issued an official work permit.
Where the others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: &quot;They violated the law, but they are not criminals.&quot;
There is no court, but they must be deported - they must be kept somewhere.
The federation made such a decision to equip such places at the expense of regional funds.
In the Voronezh region, such a place has been determined - this is Staraya Olshanka of the Semiluksky district.
Well, in the end, the regional parliament gave new privileges to parents with many children.
Firstly, families with 5 or more children are completely exempt from transport tax.
In this case, the budget loses 3.5 million - but parents with many children save the same amount.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who adopt 3 or more babies will receive subsidies for housing starting from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30 thousand per square meter.
A family, for example, of 6 people - dad, mom, own child and the third - adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the state purchases housing with an area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or Yugo-Zapadny microdistrict - quite an acceptable option.
Well, in the regional center for this amount you can already buy a whole cottage.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Releases School Allergy Guidelines for Children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a list of guidelines for managing food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations to be issued by the US government as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is growing.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to help if an allergic reaction occurs.
It also recommends that schools keep a supply of adrenaline - most commonly injected with the EpiPen automatic medical syringe - to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures recently amended their regulations to allow schools to supply adrenaline more easily.
The notice also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “it feels like something is poking into my tongue,” “it feels like I have hair on my tongue,” or “my tongue is pinching.”
Kenyan press outraged by provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there are reasons for the question: what can prevent the Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” The newspaper reported, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, the parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya&#39;s most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said the new media judiciary &quot;will always be biased as it is an extension of the government,&quot; and restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya&#39;s position in the global economy.
“I hope that the president will listen to us and we are asking him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law would effectively allow the government to “grab the media in a stranglehold,” while The Standard reported that democracy and free speech in Kenya “received a serious blow” and criticized the bill as “draconian”.
The passage of the bill is part of measures taken to strengthen national security following the September Muslim terrorist attack at the Westgate mall.
Kenyan media outlets angered authorities by broadcasting surveillance footage of troops that were sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting an expensive shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimayo responded by calling two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was canceled following massive media protests.
Under the new law, publishing houses can be fined up to KSh20 million and individual journalists up to one million, with the added risk of being “delisted”, that is, banned from obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the power to confiscate the offender&#39;s property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, &quot;Even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM radio stations.&quot;
She also said that these measures could have a devastating effect on the so-called “vibrant blogosphere” in Kenya.
Politicians understand that by silencing the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew, characterizing the Kenyan media as a key source of restraining and balancing forces in public life.
“Left to their own devices, politicians will ruin the country and return us to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public outrage in the past.
In May, they voted to end the cuts imposed by the National Salary Commission and restore their huge, tax-free salary of around 532,000 shillings a month, one of the highest in the world.
Investigators check information about child abuse in Biysk
On October 29, the media published a message that a teacher of one of the kindergartens in the city of Biysk locked a child in a basement for educational purposes.
At present, investigators are investigating all the circumstances, and also giving a legal assessment of the actions of the kindergarten staff.
After being accused of bad taste, Evgenia Vasilyeva spoke
Evgenia Vasilyeva, to whose person close attention of the media has been riveted for almost a year, has never commented on numerous publications in the press both about embezzlement in the Ministry of Defense and about her personally - relations with ex-Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and about her addiction to valuable things.
However, on November 1, the person involved in the Oboronservis case broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said: &quot;Initially, of course, there was exactly one task: to get any negative information out of me regarding the former defense minister.&quot;
There was blackmail about the fact that I should testify, otherwise they will put me in jail.
As of today, these threats have stopped.
Then we go to court, we will prove our innocence.
We are 100 percent sure of victory.
At the same time, we can conclude from the interview that, perhaps, Vasiliev was touched most of all by the words that her taste does not matter.
Probably, this refers to the statement of the official representative of the RF IC, Vladimir Markin, that fakes were found in the collection of paintings collected by the defendant in the Oboronservis case.
Among the arrested property there are a number of paintings that the hostess, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art history examination, appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings, found that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap fakes, &quot;Markin said in early October.
Some pictures stolen from the Ministry of Defense ...
Then they nevertheless admitted that they had not been stolen from the Ministry of Defense, while they said that my taste was bad.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss some personal issues?
In my opinion, this is just lawlessness, &quot;says Vasilyeva.
At the same time, when asked whether she admits her guilt in at least one of the 12 criminal episodes imputed to her, Vasilyeva said: “Of course not.
There is nothing to recognize at all.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They just mislead the people, that&#39;s all.
In addition, in response to today&#39;s statement by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation that Vasilyeva is avoiding studying the materials of the criminal case, the defendant&#39;s lawyer said that the investigator does not allow him and his client to get acquainted with the materials of the case.
What was the reason for the revelations of Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest, who has not yet communicated with the press?
Perhaps, as a woman, she could not fail to respond to the accusation of bad taste?
Or are the journalists of &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot; right, who asserted a couple of days ago that she &quot;fell into an even greater trance under house arrest&quot; because of the news of Anatoly Serdyukov&#39;s reconciliation with his wife and his return to the bosom of the family?
The well-known military observer of &quot;KP&quot; Viktor Baranets in his article &quot;Serdyukov returned to his wife?&quot; wrote: &quot;Investigators do not rule out that after such a shock, she may become more talkative during interrogations.&quot;
Earlier, Vasilyeva took on some accusations of illegal sale of real estate by the Ministry of Defense.
Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the next Italian championship match with Parma.
According to Football Italia, the coaching staff decided not to include him in the application for the game in order to preserve him before the match of the 4th round of the Champions League group stage with Real Madrid.
Lichtsteiner, Vucinich and Pepe will also not take part in the duel with Parma.
And forward Fabio Quagliarella has recovered from his injury and is ready to play.
The UK government has announced a study to improve the economic benefits for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project envisages the opening of a high-speed connection to Scotland and the north of England, with the start of the First Phase in 2026
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project will &quot;unite the UK.&quot;
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was &quot;thrilled&quot; at the prospect of working on a plan with the UK government.
Phase One will involve the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase Two is completed, the lines will be routed to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from £ 32.7 billion to £ 42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in rail capacity and reduced travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the ability to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our goal with HS2 is to create a truly national network that brings the UK and its cities closer together.&quot;
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis on our rail network.
But we are also talking about the transport links of cities with each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get better connections with HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: &quot;Today&#39;s announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot;
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to &quot;unequivocally&quot; support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: &quot;High-speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland&#39;s economic weight to the overall case for high-speed rail across the UK.&quot;
Therefore, we are delighted to be working in partnership with the UK government to explore options for building a high-speed rail in Scotland, creating a benefit for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburgh rail line that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the findings of the study with British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
US cuts food allowance for the poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $ 36 per month
Since Friday, the US has been cutting back on food stamps, known as &quot;Food Stamp Benefits,&quot; as the government&#39;s program ends.
The food allowance for a family of four will now be $ 36 less per month than before, officials said.
This will affect the 47 million poorest Americans.
In fiscal 2012, Reuters averaged $ 133 a month per person.
US food aid spending rose to $ 80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Roughly 14% of Americans rely on free food aid, which has been called “Food Stamp Benefits” since the days when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis hit, the program was expanded to spur economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
But Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts in the program&#39;s funding, arguing that it should aim to help those who need it the most.
Grocery store owners across America worry that the cuts will drive down consumer spending.
US congressmen continue to argue about how to further cut government funding.
Due to the new rules introduced by Russian customs, hundreds of trucks have been queuing at the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install dry closets
Hundreds of trucks have accumulated at the border points at the entrance to Russia.
This situation arose due to changes in the rules for customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officials confirm: the queue is created by the Russian side, which did not warn about the innovations in advance.
Since October 28, the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said the deputy head of the Eastern customs, Vladimir Denisov.
The new document is used in countries that have joined the convention on international transport.
Checkpoints operate in an enhanced mode.
The correspondent of &quot;FAKTOV&quot; visited the border and talked to the truckers who were held hostage to the situation.
Prices in a roadside cafe-shop at the Novoazovsk checkpoint are growing every day, as is the queue of trucks.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
The customs terminal Novoazovsk - Veselo-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine along the international highway.
From here, cargo is sent to the Stavropol Territory of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, they still let them in until midnight, and then they introduced these rules, - complains the trucker Aleksey Golovanev (pictured), who is transporting cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan in transit through Russia and has been spending the night in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, in order to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment of cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the cargo and the distance it is transported.
The minimum insurance is 4.5-5 thousand rubles (about 1100-1300 hryvnia).
Those who travel nearby (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to 50 thousand dollars, pay about 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnia) and drive through.
And the rest are stuck - after all, no one has such a lot of money with them!
Imagine if a driver is carrying a load worth only four thousand dollars, but already to Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnia) to pay for transit!
There are no conditions for survival at the border, ”complain the truckers who have settled down to eat near their cars.
In the border shops and cafes, it is always expensive, but we have never seen such prices as here!
The sellers got their bearings and quickly inflated them: 15 hryvnia is a loaf, seven hryvnia - a glass of coffee, 25 hryvnia - a bowl of soup.
And the cafe is one.
And there is no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, and go to the toilet there.
Neither wash nor shave ...
I can stay in the car for a week, my wife has prepared everything for the trip.
I will last a week, - another trucker Viktor Skotarenko consoles himself.
Will the queue reach my car in a week?
How much do you have a liter and a half of water? - we are interested in the only border shop.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
Is it a crystal bottle or is the water infused with silver?
We have a cafe, not a shop.
Take it while there is still something else, - retorts the saleswoman.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the regional authorities drew attention to the plight of Ukrainian drivers.
The leadership of the Amvrosievskaya and Novoazovskaya regional state administrations were instructed to provide everyone who is standing in line at the Ukrainian-Russian border with drinking water, ”said Sergei Dergunov, acting chairman of the Donetsk Regional State Administration.
Now ambulance teams are on duty at the checkpoints.
Also, for the convenience of people, dry closets will be installed.
According to the official, the problem related to queues will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk Regional State Administration, as of October 31, 32 and 68 vehicles were idle at the Uspenka and Novoazovsk international checkpoints, respectively.
&quot;FACTS&quot; will follow the development of the situation.
Sony expects lower annualized profit
Japanese electronics manufacturer Sony Corporation, ending the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $ 197 million, cut its profit forecast for the current fiscal year.
Sony&#39;s results for the period from July to September 2013 turned out to be more depressing than expected, due to the fall in demand for TVs, camcorders and personal computers manufactured by the Japanese corporation.
Sony&#39;s television business, which brought the company its first operating profit in three years in the second quarter of 5.2 billion yen, in the reporting period fell again to 9.3 billion yen in operating loss.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through a tough time, especially as the demand for TVs declines.
And while competitors are looking for a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony&#39;s main rivals, Panasonic Corp., has recently shifted its focus to industrial components, where the company&#39;s sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which ends in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that this figure would be significantly higher and amount to 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In the middle of this month, the start of sales of &quot;smart&quot; watches from a Japanese corporation was announced, endowed with a number of fashionable functions that will eliminate the need to take a smartphone out of your pocket 100 times a day.
After Sony cut its full-year earnings and revenue guidance, the company&#39;s shares lost more than 11% at the Tokyo trade open in the morning, dropping to 1,668 yen per share.
How much do deceased celebrities earn - MK in the USA MK
The list of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was topped by Madonna, who earned $ 125 million.
But she was &quot;outdone&quot; by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 amounted to 160 million.
Noticeably lagging behind him are other deceased celebrities, who last year &quot;earned&quot; several times less.
The second in the list of the &quot;wealthiest&quot; departed celebrities, compiled by Forbes magazine at the end of the year, was Elvis Presley - 55 million per year, and a line below the author of Peanuts comics Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition to them, the top five included Elizabeth Taylor, who was the leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also includes Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
Eser proposes to equate insult to patriotic feelings with extremism
To legislatively protect the patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, A Just Russia proposes to equate insult to patriotic feelings with extremist activities and punish them with five years in prison.
As reported by the Izvestia newspaper, such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the deputy chairman of the Duma Committee on Energy Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the government for an opinion.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments suggests understanding the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for this country, a responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, in domestic legislation there are sanctions for desecration of the formal signs of state power - the flag and coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be hurt by insulting state symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, is not sufficiently developed in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites the debates that unfold annually on the eve of Victory Day, when some media figures dare to question the heroic deed of the people of the USSR in the fight against the Nazis.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real orgy unfolds every year.
Exercising wit and an &quot;alternative view&quot; of history, some publicists reach the point of arguing that, they say, what a pity that cultured Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I think this is absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main &quot;spiritual bond&quot; of the nation, ”says Oleg Mikheev indignantly.
In addition, according to Mikheev, there are much more patriotic people in Russia than religious people, but at the same time the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and insulting patriotic feelings can be practically unpunished.
According to the people&#39;s deputy, it is necessary to equate insult to patriotic feelings with extremist activity and to prescribe the corresponding punishment in Article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a 100,000th fine to 5 years in prison.
The influence of jailers will increase in the new composition of public oversight commissions
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new compositions of public oversight commissions (POC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, the security forces&#39; lobbyists will increase their influence.
PMC are public structures that control the conditions of detention in places of deprivation of liberty.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhaev, unrest in the Kopeisk colony - it is through the POC that most of the resonant incidents behind bars are made public.
There is a struggle for control over the POCs between human rights activists and lobbyists of the security forces.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the PMC, I proposed to make the selection criterion the experience of human rights activities.
“They didn’t accept him, and they formed lists without elaborating criteria,” says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, an all-Russian structure of human rights defenders working on prison issues.
When he was a State Duma deputy from Yabloko, he developed a law regulating the activities of the POC.
The OP Council must vote for the composition of the PMC in 43 regions of the country.
Less than a thousand applicants apply for 1,800 vacancies, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, competitions could not be organized due to the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize additional recruitment for vacancies.
The POC of Moscow is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that the new composition will have 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borshchev, in the current composition of the capital&#39;s commission there are 11 human rights defenders and 9 security officials, and in the version that is on the vote in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to get into the commission of the capital.
On the other hand, a representative of the &quot;Combat Brotherhood&quot; Vyacheslav Kalinin may re-enter the new composition.
He was a member of the POC for three years, but he never visited the prisoners.
Borshchev believes that the security forces, by appointing their chairman of the POC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not exclude a collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their opinion, the advancement of the security forces is coordinated by a member of the POC, Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the &quot;Officers of Russia&quot; - an organization that defends the interests of security agencies.
“I don’t eat babies for breakfast,” Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies lobbying for the promotion of any lists and says he has no intention of preventing human rights defenders from visiting arrested opposition figures.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in what list the OP was currently voting for.
He considers the disclosure of information by Borshev as a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of the leadership of the Chelyabinsk POC.
Its former leaders will be removed due to last year&#39;s kopek unrest.
The Public Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of the prisoners.
But the POC of Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to security officials.
The human rights activist-chairman of the local commission “disappeared” from the new lists, but one of his opponents turned out to be, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber expelled him for unethical behavior.
Borshchev considers the lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions &quot;revenge for Kopeisk.&quot;
The disclosures of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not affect the POC of Mordovia, which is considered a &quot;force&quot;: only one human rights activist wanted to get into the new composition, and her documents for the competition were not even accepted.
Nikolai Svanidze, a member of the OP council, told RBC daily that he had voted against the proposed list, as he was outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He circulated his position to other members of the council.
His colleague in the OP, Pavel Gusev, says that he voted for, as he likes the proposed Moscow list.
The compilation of the POC lists was coordinated by the Deputy Secretary of the OP Vladislav Grib, who is also an employee of the Research Institute of the Federal Penitentiary Service.
Grib told RBC Daily that he does not consider it correct to divide the candidates into human rights defenders and security officials and does not agree that the chairmen of the commissions have enough powers to hinder the work of its members.
Mushroom does not undertake to predict the results of the vote of the OP council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a revised version will be voted on in the coming days.
Clive Palmer claims MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave because his daughters could get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who has an unresolved dispute over the payment of a $ 6 million carbon tax, made the announcement at a time when he was trying to brush aside questions about whether he was in conflict.
The United Palmer Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be critical in deciding whether to end carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest, and said that Mr Abbott&#39;s daughters would personally benefit from the policy measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether they get the leave or not,” said Mr Palmer. ...
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast Fairfax seat by 53 votes after recount.
Mr. Palmer has called for a review of the electoral counting process to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott&#39;s daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should a decision on this election be made two months after we voted?
“We need to have a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn&#39;t we have such a system so that we can come, enter our data into a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 18:30 that evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for marking ballots.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn&#39;t like it?
It seems strange to use a pencil these days.
The Electoral Commission is investigating e-voting options and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his program includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he will take his new job “very seriously”.
Public office presupposes service to the community.
“We are not seeking any awards other than the gratitude of history for being able to serve this district at a critical juncture,” he said.
Nortel Patent Claims Against Google, Samsung, Huawei
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a string of patent lawsuits Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, which it outbid in a Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel&#39;s patents for $ 4.5 billion, has filed patent infringement lawsuits in the US District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents cover technologies that help match Internet search keywords with relevant advertisements, the lawsuit says, which is the backbone of Google&#39;s search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones running on Google&#39;s Android operating system, which competes fiercely with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price tag of $ 900 million for Nortel&#39;s patents.
Google raised its bid several times, ultimately offering a whopping $ 4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $ 12.5 billion, in part driven by Motorola&#39;s patent library.
“Despite an unsuccessful attempt to purchase patents at auction, which are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” - said in the lawsuit.
Rockstar is demanding increased damages from Google as it claims the patent infringement on the part of Google is willful, as claimed.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22 thousand spectators, said the police officers who attended the meeting of the FTC RFU today.
The ticket program is overestimated, in their opinion, by about two times.
During the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup with “Spartak”, only a thousand stewards were involved with the regulatory norm of nine thousand.
Spartak fans were entitled to 2,200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the stadium&#39;s capacity, however, by agreement with the Moscow club, 5,000 tickets were sold to them.
These data were announced by the head of the FTC Artur Grigoryants.
A bird airlifted to safety from a North Sea rig released back into the wild
The bird, airlifted ashore after being found emaciated on an oil rig in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was placed in a helicopter bound for Aberdeen last month and then departed by the Scottish Chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at the rescue center in Alloa.
Center manager Colin Seddon said: &quot;This water shepherd is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who was caught in a zone of high winds over the North Sea.&quot;
It looks like the bird was exhausted and was able to find refuge on an oil rig.
He added: &quot;She was unable to take off again, so we were asked for help.&quot;
The Water Shepherd was healthy and in good health by the time he was released.
Fines for unauthorized street vending in Vologda will grow exponentially
According to the city authorities, an increase in the size of fines will help to restore order in Vologda and free the streets from spontaneous tents and stalls.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, and the products they sell often do not pass the appropriate sanitary control.
This means that the health of Vologda residents is under threat.
So, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, according to the press service of the Vologda Administration.
In September, 600 people were dismissed from the Ford automobile plant in Vsevolozhsk.
As they say in the trade unions, all the dismissed received compensation.
However, much more acute than the problems of workers is the question of reducing industrial production in the region.
The deputy of the regional ZakSa Alexei Etmanov said at the meeting that about 600 people were dismissed at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk.
According to him, this happened back in September: then, according to the voluntary dismissal program, which was developed together with the organization&#39;s trade union, about 600 people left the plant.
The workers who decided to resign of their own free will were offered &quot;golden parachutes&quot; in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority left jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is a whole night shift.
I think this is not the end of it.
However, the authorities in the next two years do not plan to adopt any programs to support regional enterprises in a difficult situation, &quot;he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and a large reduction in jobs.
In &quot;Ford&quot; this information is not refuted or confirmed.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will definitely publish it.
There have been talks for a long time about reducing workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk.
For example, the company&#39;s plans to fire 600 people became known back in September.
Earlier, the plant announced the suspension of car production.
The plant cited a drop in demand for Ford cars in Russia as the reason.
According to Petrostat, in the first nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in the Leningrad region decreased by 5.4%.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
Dmitry Medvedev: the growth rate of Russia&#39;s GDP is insufficient for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that the growth rate of its GDP is insufficient for the Russian Federation and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
We planned this year&#39;s GDP growth in the region of 3%, maybe even a little more.
In reality, it will be slightly less than 2%.
Against the background of the recession in a number of European countries, it seems not very bad, but for us it is not enough, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be higher rates.
Now it is very important that Russian companies and Russian business receive normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing that must be done, &quot;the head of government stressed.
Director of “Ugra” Andrey Belmach noted that it is difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so I am not ready to say how long it will take to find a new coach, ”ITAR-TASS quotes Belmach as saying.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are exploring all possible options.
The priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I would like not only to find a coach, but a person who will work in our club for several years and achieve certain results with him.
The snowboarder was specially photographed for the Olympic banknote
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, which will host the Olympic Games this winter.
The denomination of the note is 100 rubles.
But on the web, bloggers are already actively sneering about the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic banknote on October 30, they drew attention to the fact that the image of the snowboarder from the banknote can be found in photo banks.
In particular, in the free StockExchange photo storage, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop tutorial posted on the Russian Megaobzor website on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in advertising for RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic banknote is made in blue and blue colors.
On the one hand, a snowboarder is depicted flying over Sochi, on the other, a view of the Olympic stadium and the Firebird.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named after Repin.
At the presentation, it was noted that several sports were considered - alpine skiing, freestyle and ski jumping, but in the end they chose snowboard, since it is a relatively young sport.
According to a Izvestia source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the public opinion regarding the wide distribution of the image of a snowboarder from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But in Goznak they are not too worried about the hype around the Olympic banknote.
Natalya Nikiforova, the head of the press service of the State Sign, told Izvestia that all the arguments about plagiarism are ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote is turned to the right, in the photos on the net - to the left, &#39;&#39; Nikiforova clarified.
To create a bill, the person at the photo session was filmed from different angles, then the final image was chosen, on it - the characteristic pose of a snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist received a salary for the work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic banknote is completely positive.
The recognizability of the image on the banknote is a plus for its promotion, - says Aleksey Popovichev, executive director of RusBrand NP.
It is quite difficult to prove one hundred percent similarity of images on the banknote and in photobanks, therefore, claims to challenge intellectual property for this image are unlikely to come.
For the first time, the Olympic banknote appeared in China - for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008, a commemorative banknote of 10 yuan was issued.
Russia decided to support this tradition.
Sao Paulo Fashion Week.
At home, she is considered not just a fashion model, but a real star.
Despite the fact that Gisele Bundschen left her job for a while, being distracted by motherhood, these days and this week of the fashion show she came specially.
Many months of absence did not prevent her from keeping her place on the podium and on the podium.
Giselle remains the highest paid supermodel in the world.
This time she took part in the Colcci fashion show.
The finals of the fashion week are usually the most interesting shows.
Like the one organized by the stylist Lino Villaventura.
The brand is more than 30 years old, in parallel with the production of luxury ready-to-wear, the fashion designer is actively working in the theater and in the cinema, designing performances and designing costumes for many famous films.
In total, more than 30 thousand firms and companies that are related to the textile industry and the world of fashion took part in the ending fashion week in Sao Paulo.
This is one of the most dynamically developing areas of production, employing more than 2 million Brazilians, and the annual turnover reaches $ 50 billion.
Driver who was driving 130 mph with a hot drink between his legs fined £ 1000
The motorist was fined £ 1000 for driving at speeds up to 130 mph (210 km / h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 circuit in Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a takeaway drink between his legs.
In Colchester Magistrates&#39; Court, Howie pleaded guilty to driving without due diligence and attention.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driver&#39;s license resulted in him receiving a six-month ban from driving.
Howie was also ordered to pay a cost of £ 90 and an additional £ 100 Victim Assistance Tax.
Pensions to increase in Belarus since November
Pensions have been raised in Belarus since November this year, BelTA learned from the main department of pension provision of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection.
From November 1 of this year, the average wages of workers in the republic will be adjusted, applied during the previous recalculation of pensions, with an increase in its value by 5.4% and the corresponding recalculation of labor pensions will be made in accordance with the decree of October 21, 2013 No. 478 &quot;On increasing pensions &quot;.
As a result of recalculation from November, labor pensions for old age will increase, according to estimates, by an average of 5.3%.
The average old-age pension will amount to Br2 million 295 thousand.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million residents of the republic.
The expenditures of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Belarus on the payment of increased pensions will increase by Br274.3 billion per month from November this year.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of labor pensions in November of this year, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and additional payments to pensions will be recalculated in connection with an increase in the subsistence minimum budget on average per capita.
The BPM for the period from November 1, 2013 to January 31, 2014 was approved by the government in the amount of Br1 million 47 thousand 530, which is 2.1% higher than the one that operated from August 1 to October 31.
Accordingly, the minimum labor pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and additional payments to pensions will be increased by 2.1% from November 1.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion has been allocated for the payment of pensions, taking into account the increases in 2013.
NSA blames &quot;internal error&quot;, not hackers for site shutdown
Shrouded in secrecy, the National Security Agency said Friday night that the shutdown of their site for several hours caused a technical glitch, not hackers, as the network claimed.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,” the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
Claims that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack are incorrect.
Earlier tonight, online server monitoring systems reported that the NSA site had been down for at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency&#39;s internal secret network was &quot;far from&quot; being hacked.
No classified information is at risk, a spokesman said.
At least one online group of hacker activists said it was responsible for taking down the NSA site with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is down.
Hackers&#39; tactics are relatively straightforward, and attacks are not designed to infiltrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secret NSA, once dubbed &quot;No Such Agency,&quot; has come to the fore in recent months with fierce criticism after a string of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and domestically, all in reaction to classified NSA files stolen from agencies and published by disaffected former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the agency has sparked speculation that today&#39;s incident was the result of targeted hackers.
Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria heralds a new era in the gas sector
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today is a landmark event: construction has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to diversify Russia&#39;s export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which contains most of Russia&#39;s gas destined for Europe, increases the risk for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated &quot;forever.&quot;
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries further along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The pipeline has an annual design capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Rosbalt agency stripped of media status for obscene language
On October 31, the Moscow City Court ruled to invalidate the license to register the Rosbalt agency, writes Lenta.
Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of its media status for systematic and gross violations of the law on the media.
During the process, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media outlets, in fact, denying the publication the right to put forward counterarguments.
What is Rosbalt
CJSC &quot;Information Agency Rosbalt&quot; was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
The agency also has representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency&#39;s exclusive publications was (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talk about the publication&#39;s proximity to the security forces continued throughout the agency&#39;s existence.
Along with the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive base of sources in various departments, the fact that Natalya Chaplina, the wife of Viktor Cherkesov, was at the head of the project, also spoke in favor of such assumptions.
At the same time, Chaplina&#39;s role in the management of Rosbalt is not completely clear: most often she is called the &quot;project manager&quot;.
The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonina, the chief editor is Nikolay Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt has not appeared in the ratings of the federal media - neither in terms of citation, nor in terms of audience.
In October, the agency took 25th place in the rating of traffic on Russian media sites according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), the monthly audience is about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials over the past five months are notes about the Kremlin&#39;s helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the lead singer of the &quot;King and the Jester&quot; group, and pogroms in the capital Biryulyovo.
The conflict between Rosbalt and Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the law on mass media came into force, banning foul language on journalists.
The agency found prohibited vocabulary in two videos published on the agency&#39;s website (&quot;Dzhigit from Krasnodar&quot; and &quot;Pussy Riot defiled oil rigs&quot;).
Further sides are described in different ways.
Roskomnadzor, on the basis of the video footage found, accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violation of the law on mass media and went to court demanding to revoke the agency&#39;s license.
Rosbalt stated that the agency&#39;s claims were inappropriate: firstly, the videos were not editorial materials, secondly, the obscene words in them were disguised, and, thirdly, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed the claims of Roskomnadzor in the magistrates&#39; court - and when on October 22, 2013 the Moscow City Court accepted the claim of Roskomnadzor, the consideration of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, on the 25th, the magistrate made a decision not in favor of Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offenses and was fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow City Court - if we abandon the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined even earlier.
On October 31, the court ruled to invalidate Rosbalt&#39;s registration certificate, effectively depriving the agency of its media status.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The agency was supported by State Duma deputies (a statement addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Zharov, was signed on October 10 by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation).
The head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Council for Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov stated that the publication was unlawful.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even provided him with some guarantees that it would not come to the revocation of the license.
The trial of Rosbalt showed that under whose jurisdiction it is safer for the media to be in Russia today is a big question.
Speech gene turned out to be a stimulant of synapse formation
Scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein that makes the Foxp2 &quot;speech gene&quot; function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study was published in Science, you can read a summary of it on the journal&#39;s website.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
It was possible to establish his role in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce the words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other themselves.
Scientists found out that the Foxp2 gene was disrupted in family members, but how it performs its function remained unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of Foxp2&#39;s function is to stimulate the formation of new synapses in the brain region associated with speech formation.
He does this thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of a search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 turned out to be one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, while only its activity is affected by Foxp2.
Scientists have confirmed that SRPX2 does affect vocalization in an experiment on mice.
When the gene activity was artificially reduced in animals, they screamed less when separated from their mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of the sounds emitted was also restored.
Previously, in mice, a connection with the vocalization of Foxp2 itself has also been shown.
Animals injected with a human copy of the gene squeaked more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, the SRPX2 controlled by it is connected with purely &quot;mechanical&quot; properties of sound formation or more subtle processes.
Ponomarev left &quot;Fair Russia&quot;
State Duma deputy from the &quot;Fair Russia&quot; party, a member of its branch in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, has submitted an application for resignation from the political organization.
As the parliamentarian stated, he submitted an application to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the &quot;spravedrossy&quot;.
We sit drinking tea ...
&quot;For some reason, many want to see the picture&quot; Ilya Ponomarev puts his party card on the table, &quot;but there is nothing so epochal in this,&quot; the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the Social Revolutionaries.
Meanwhile, Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to give up the mandate of a State Duma deputy.
He explained that, despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and, according to the law, cannot leave it.
Messages about the intention of Ilya Ponomarev to leave the &quot;Fair Russia&quot; party appeared on October 30.
It was reported that Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov would leave &quot;SR&quot; together with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Want a glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world&#39;s first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came up with this idea after reading a scientific article on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person eating it, raising the pH in the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that because ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the warmth of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of Lick Me I&#39;m Yum ice cream company, says: &quot;It&#39;s incredible, but still in its infancy when it comes to production, so for £ 200 you get about 2g of the substance.&quot;
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So when the protein warms up in your mouth, it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will start to glow.
We&#39;ve been testing it for the past few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
This is possibly the most expensive ice cream I have ever made, because the luminescence of a jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each balloon costs me around £ 140.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie&#39;s experimental company, based in Bristol, is renowned for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheesy, beef, and gold leaf flavors.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said, &quot;I really want to develop invisible ice cream.&quot;
This is by definition not possible due to the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we&#39;ll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
GM recalls a number of new pickup trucks in the US for the finalization of seat backs
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address manual seatback recline issues, according to a notice from US auto safety regulators on Friday.
On some of the pickup trucks, the front seats may have a defect in the backrest recline mechanism.
As a result, seat backs do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
“When a vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” a notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#39;s website said.
The recall models were manufactured between August 1st and September 10th.
Production of GM&#39;s pickup trucks began in June and represents the most important series production launch for the leading American automaker since its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring.
GM informed pickup truck owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was unable to consider notification to owners due to a 16-day government shutdown that slowed car sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 lineup, grew by about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said Friday.
GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups in October.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon rose 1.4 percent to $ 37.47.
A pedestrian zone was opened in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery
A new pedestrian zone has appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies an area two kilometers from the Novokuznetskaya metro station to Bolotnaya Square.
Street lamps, flower beds, benches, trash cans and toilets have been installed throughout, blank fences and illegal advertisements have been removed.
In addition to the Klimentovsky and Lavrushinsky lanes, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed for cars - Ordynsky blind alley, Bolshoy and Maly Tolmachevsky lanes, Kadashevskaya embankment and Bolotnaya square.
Transport movement along Maroseyka and Petrovka streets is not limited.
On the section of Pyatnitskaya Street from the vestibule of the Novokuznetskaya station to Klimentovsky Lane, conditions for pedestrians were created without stopping traffic and cutting the carriageway, newsmsk.com reports.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the Church of the Holy Martyr Clement of the Pope, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, Tverskoy Proezd, Stoleshnikov Lane and Kuznetsky Most Street became completely pedestrianized.
Bolshaya Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, was decided to be closed for cars on weekends and holidays.
The fans of “Zenith” on the official website of the club recognized the ex-captain of the Russian national team as the best player of the past month.
In October, Arshavin took part in two matches of the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, three meetings of the Russian championship and in the cup match.
On account of his 2 assists.
The second place at the end of the month went to goalkeeper Yuri Lodygin, who became the best player in August and September.
In third position is the striker Hulk.
The Brazilian has two goals and three assists.
Recall that Arshavin returned to Zenit this summer.
A series of premiere film screenings &quot;Art Mainstream&quot; will be held in Moscow
A series of screenings &quot;Art Mainstream&quot;, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held at the Rolan cinema from November 1 to 5, RIA Novosti reports citing the organizers of the project.
The program of &quot;Art Mainstream&quot; will be opened by the French comedy &quot;Paris at any cost&quot; by director and actress Reim Kerici.
This is a story about a model Maya (Kerichi herself) working in the French capital, who is deported to her homeland in Morocco due to visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi&#39;s film, viewers will also be shown a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-Dook &quot;Mobius&quot;, Oliver Hirschbigel&#39;s melodramatic biopic &quot;Diana: A Love Story&quot; (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the title role and the main film of the May Cannes Film Festival &quot;Life of Adele&quot; Abdelatif Keshisha.
The only Russian participant in the &quot;Art Mainstream&quot; will be Alexander Veledinsky&#39;s film &quot;The Geographer Drank His Globe&quot;, which won the Kinotavr festival, based on the novel of the same name by Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - the charming loser-teacher Viktor Sluzhkin - in the film was played by Konstantin Khabensky, whose work was also awarded the Kinotavr prize.
Snowden is ready to &quot;cooperate&quot; with Germany on the issue of US intelligence
Edward Snowden, a whistleblower of US intelligence, said he was prepared to travel to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Streebele on Thursday met with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he was granted asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: &quot;Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political speech with criminal charges that offer no protection.&quot; ...
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believes that the support of the international community can persuade the US government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought against the US Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: &quot;If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak with German officials, we will find ways to make it possible.&quot;
Relations between the United States and Germany have become strained after allegations that the NSA had tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s phone.
Thomas Opperman, the MP who leads the parliamentary group that oversees the intelligence service, said that if there is an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, &quot;without endangering him or destroying relations with the US completely,&quot; it should be used.
Mr Streebele, MP from the German Green Party, posted a picture of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Strebele said that, according to a lawyer for a former NSA contractor, Mr Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be &quot;safe&quot; there, the deputy said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a &quot;tough and constant&quot; campaign of harassment that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was encouraged by the worldwide reaction to &quot;his political speech.&quot;
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials - including in the United States - have found it beneficial to the public to expose the uncontrolled system of pervasive surveillance.
The letter contains an offer to cooperate with the German authorities &quot;when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.&quot;
Foreign workers on subclass 457 visas can be tested for &quot;authenticity&quot;
An &quot;authenticity&quot; test for foreign workers on 457 visas is pending government review as it envisions more repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied under criteria aimed at preventing the use of 457 visas to fill unskilled positions or as a loophole for family and friends to travel to Australia.
The government&#39;s debate document was released today while former Labor MP Maxine McCue criticized the government&#39;s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia&#39;s neighbors.
“The loud statements like &#39;foreigners to the back of the queue&#39; and &#39;jobs to Australians first&#39; represent a very unpleasant setback to a time when unions were demanding a protected labor market,” she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that needed to be protected - and if some in the region saw echoes of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The document presented for discussion outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Secretary Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O&#39;Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to meet with officials about the smuggling of people, has already made five of the recommended changes, and the rest are under consideration.
If the criteria for “authenticity” are accepted, the visa applicant can be investigated “whether the candidacy is genuine when the applicant is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person involved in the financing of the enterprise”.
Businesses may also be required to report on the number of subclass 457 visa holders, as businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers have previously recruited hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of an alleged heart attack after arriving in a boatload of refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man&#39;s grief-stricken nine-year-old son accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father&#39;s death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the ship.
The Australian authorities rushed the man to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
Colorado head coach Patrick Roy, explaining the decision to release the goalkeeper Semyon Varlamov from the first minutes of Friday&#39;s match against Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas SE correspondent Natalia Shmeleva.
Why should we wait, - said Roy after the morning rolling of &quot;Avalanche&quot;.
Of course, what happened worries us all, but we are confident in him and feel that it will be useful for him to go on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
That is, you are completely sure that the situation did not affect the goalkeeper&#39;s condition in any way?
Today we&#39;ll see.
Undoubtedly, our players will support Varley by helping him to protect the goal, as it was in previous matches this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to draw any conclusions until the court understands this situation.
Baumgertner nominated to the board of directors of Uralkali
The current board of directors of OJSC Uralkali has proposed the candidacy of Vladislav Baumgertner, who was arrested in Minsk, to the new board of directors, according to the website of the Russian company.
Bamugertner is on the list of 11 people nominated for the new board of directors.
This list was prepared for the extraordinary meeting of shareholders on November 29, which will determine the new composition of the board of directors by voting.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
When detained in August this year, he was charged with abuse of power.
However, later, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko said at a press conference that the accusations against Baumgertner had been reclassified as &quot;embezzlement.&quot;
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan to supply Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
Negotiations are under way with the IMF for a stand-by loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their goal is to conclude an agreement as soon as possible.
At the same time, in addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters question whether Ukraine and the IMF are capable of overcoming long-standing disagreements over funding terms.
Nor does the international rating agency S&amp;P believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to receive aid, which on Friday downgraded Ukraine&#39;s sovereign rating by one notch - to &quot;B-&quot; from &quot;B&quot;.
However, EU officials say the IMF can be flexible in terms of lending, given the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the plan of financial support for the country, the EU has a backup option to provide Ukraine with gas, the overwhelming majority of which is now supplied from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from Nord Stream or reverse gas from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most feasible and acceptable way in the event that Russia &quot;isolates&quot; Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and is likely to lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
&quot;Negotiations are underway between the EU countries and the Ukrainians on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from sources other than Russia, or from the same source, but via other routes,&quot; the source added to Reuters.

In the United States, it will be possible to use mobile phones during takeoff and landing
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during takeoff and landing of an airliner have been approved in the United States, according to the BBC.
US airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, with the new rules going into effect by the end of 2013.
However, Internet communication for receiving and sending emails will be prohibited when flying at altitudes below 3 kilometers.
Due to the danger of interference with aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communications will continue to be banned.
Thus, passengers on flights will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of using electronic devices throughout the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the US Federal Aviation Administration that they can deal with the alleged impact of mobiles on aircraft and aircraft controls.
According to the source, following the example of the United States, Britain may also revise the current rules for the use of electronic devices in flight.
Run out on the field in the match &quot;Shinnik&quot;
Some details have become known about the personality of the fan who ran out onto the field during the 1/16 finals of the Russian Cup between Yaroslavl “Shinnik” and Moscow “Spartak”.
According to the head of the FTC RFU Artur Grigoryants, referring to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Muscovite.
At the moment he is detained.
“In addition, Grigoryants talked about how the fan managed to break into the field:“ It turned out that this one, let&#39;s call him a spectator, went to the ambulance, accompanied by two spectators, citing heart problems.
He went to the ambulance - this was confirmed to us by the ambulance doctor.
And then he pushed the two escorts away and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the East and South Stands to the corner of the East and North Stands.
He ran across the entire field.
Stewards are responsible for this.
Until the entry into force of the law on sports, this is the area of action of the stewards - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field.
He ran to the stand, climbed over the East Stand.
And at this time, riots broke out on the East Stand and on the treadmills, &quot;said the head of the FTC.
Recall that by the decision of the FTC, Moscow “Spartak” will play without spectators the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian championship against “Lokomotiv” and “Zenith”, and will also pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Arshavin&#39;s ex-wife is resting with actor Andrey Chadov
Yulia Baranovskaya, the former common-law wife of the St. Petersburg Zenit football player Andrei Arshavin, is on vacation with actor Andrei Chadov.
Julia is resting in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zadorozhnaya, her fiancé, figure skater Sergei Slavnov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Pictures from joint walks of couples were published on Instagram by Anastasia Zadorozhnaya.
This is not the first joint photo of Andrey and Yulia.
On October 5, Zadorozhnaya published a photo in which a couple is embracing on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Zenit midfielder Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lives separately from his common-law wife Yulia.
Recall that Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
Recently it became known that Arshavin is dating ex-model Alisa Kazmina.
Arshavin&#39;s new girlfriend was married to a top manager of the corporation.
The President of the Russian Federation created a separate Ministry of Construction and Housing and Utilities
Russian President Vladimir Putin created a new ministry in charge of construction and housing and communal services and offered to head it to the ex-governor of the Ivanovo region, Mikhail Menu, during a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Menem at the residence in Novo-Ogaryovo, and Men did not refuse to head the new department.
Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and housing and communal services are transferred to the new ministry from the Ministry of Regional Development.
Mikhail Men, the son of the famous Orthodox priest, Archpriest Alexander Men, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry named after Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career began - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergiev Posad District, was a deputy of the State Duma, First Deputy Prime Minister of the Moscow Region Government, and Deputy Prime Minister of the Moscow Government.
From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was the governor of the Ivanovo region.
Americans eavesdrop on Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, one of the representatives of the US intelligence services, who chose not to reveal his name, said that the United States had eavesdropped on the telephone conversations of high-ranking Japanese officials.
This person confirmed that there are several listening spots in the land of the rising sun.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, it happened during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are targets for intelligence activities, NHK reported.
None of the parties have officially commented on this information yet.
We will remind, the news about the surveillance of the US secret services for the Chancellor of Germany appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA may have been tapping Merkel&#39;s phone for the past ten years.
The chancellor herself, according to some sources, took the news of her wiretapping very painfully.
She stated that the allies, which, in her opinion, the FRG and the United States have been for decades, such monitoring of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said that he is ready to share details about wiretapping Angela Merkel&#39;s telephone conversations with employees of the German prosecutor&#39;s office.
The German flew to Moscow on purpose to meet with a former CIA officer.
Scandalous video hit the police
Toronto CEO Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly reckless antics, was caught smoking crack.
Police in the Canadian city said they have the relevant video and are ready to start an investigation against the mayor.
He said that he will not leave his post, reports CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto police website.
Local law enforcement chief Bill Blair held a press conference on the matter.
The sheriff said that he was not authorized to share these personnel with the public, but he vouches for their existence.
According to Blair, the video compromising Rob Ford was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by law enforcement officers in the summer of 2013.
Previously, the existence of this video has already been written by the Canadian press, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself does not give any comments on this matter.
He only says that he is not guilty of anything and is not going to resign.
The video found by the police is one of the pieces of evidence in the case of 35-year-old Ford friend Alexander Lisi, who is accused of dealing in soft drugs, extortion, obtaining illegal proceeds, and also a criminal conspiracy.
At times, Lisi served as Rob Ford&#39;s driver.
Residents of the city have long been demanding the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public drunk, indulged in racist and sexist statements.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide the great pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Despite the fact that right now Arbenina devotes a lot of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds the opportunity to tinker with Martha and Artyom, and not only spends time on their training, but also entertains as she can.
Over the past week, Diana has twice reported to her fans about her teaching talents.
First, she posted a photo on Facebook showing her teaching children to read.
And yesterday she pampered the fans by showing how she dressed up Artyom and Martha for Halloween.
Ready for broom racing! our first halloween &quot;- this is how Diana called the photo of her children dressed in festive costumes.
Which is not surprising, because, like no other Russian boys and girls, they are related to this holiday, since they were born in America.
An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, near the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, reports Reuters.
The source of the earthquake was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers southwest of the city, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said on the website.
The tremors were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 November 1 Moscow time).
No casualties or damage caused by tremors have yet been reported.
Recall that Chile is located in one of the most seismically active regions of the Earth, so earthquakes of various strengths are not uncommon there.
One of the most serious ones happened in 2010.
Then the earthquake of magnitude 8.8 and the tsunami caused by it led to the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake in recent history occurred in Chile: in 1960, a magnitude of 9.5 was recorded there.
More than five thousand people died as a result of that natural disaster.
OJSC &quot;Rostovaeroinvest&quot; recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the general designer of the facility.
The amount of the contract is not disclosed at Rostovaeroinvest.
According to the press service of the OJSC, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition; according to the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent for state examination in the spring of 2014.
The winner will have to design a new passenger terminal of the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and improvement elements of the airport complex.
At the first stage of construction, the inner area of the terminal will be 50 thousand square meters. m, in the future, its increase is possible.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025 the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
By the time the results of the tender were announced, the architectural concept of the Yuzhny airport complex, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects, had been determined.
The main terminal building project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in implementing large projects, the company has designed terminals C and E of the Sheremetyevo International Airport and a new air terminal complex at the Knevichi international airport in Vladivostok.
The international airport complex &quot;Yuzhny&quot; will be built in the Aksai district of the Rostov region and will replace the existing Rostov airport, which will be closed and in the future integrated into the urban development.
The start of construction of the airport complex is scheduled for 2014, the commissioning of all facilities - in 2017.
Seasoned Italian workers make way for the young
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
Data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country&#39;s population is now out of work.
Things haven&#39;t been this bad since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of residents aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
In the opinion of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already being carried out by the country&#39;s largest energy company, and the adopted laws allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for senior employees.
However, on the other hand, Italy faces a common European problem of an aging population.
And economists are not convinced that the premature rotation of staff will pay off.
Syria destroyed chemical weapons equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production capacity, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has recognized.
Damascus completed this first phase of disarmament one day before the deadline.
Until November 1, Syria had to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare chemical warfare agents for use, the BBC reports.
The destruction of the stocks of toxic substances themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to an OPCW spokesman, the toxic substances are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors traveled to Syria after a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21 killed more than 1,400 people, according to the United States.
The inspectors&#39; main task was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and munitions.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to ensure they are not repaired.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stocks of toxic substances.
There are many questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be scrutinized by Western intelligence services.
They will readily advise inspectors on new sites to check if there is reason to suspect Damascus is not completely outspoken.
The US believes that this shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded from the Syrian leadership - in accordance with an agreement reached with the mediation of Russia - to destroy or render inoperative all facilities for the production of shells, poisonous gases and liquids and for filling the shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has been passed, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already in possession of the Syrian army.
It is estimated that this arsenal could contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, blistering mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in dozens of different locations.
To destroy it, it is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities first agree on a timetable for action - this will take two weeks.
OPCW field operations chief Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors &quot;personally oversaw the destruction of the equipment.&quot;
&quot;They no longer have the ability to further manufacture or mix chemical weapons,&quot; he said.
The OPCW said in a statement that inspectors visited 21 of 23 sites in Syria and were convinced that the factories producing projectiles and toxic agents were either destroyed or rendered unusable.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to be inspected there, the document says, but the equipment was transported from there and checked by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was &quot;especially difficult&quot; because of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, the inspectors had not yet found time to celebrate - they were too busy with work.
George Kerevan: the break with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another horror story about independence.
This time we are being warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement area as a condition of EU membership.
It is the turn of the stories about passport control in Berwick and the barbed wire border along Hadrian&#39;s Wall.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of freer movement across the rest of Europe, although - predictably - it didn&#39;t make headlines.
Nor has anyone pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time twisting their formal rules to suit them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for what it really wanted the Scots to do.
So this is not a worthy story.
And so old that it turned into a fossil: the first time I heard the &quot;duck&quot; that &quot;independence means passport control&quot;, at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment lost in the retelling of an old tale.
Why should an independent Scotland obey Europe&#39;s orders at all?
Why exchange the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here&#39;s the real European news: The great post-war plan to unify Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project is officially dead.
Across the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or to abolish the euro as a single currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party - founded just this year - came out of nowhere and won nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, thus effectively ousting the Free Democrats (analogous to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag ...
There has always been internal opposition to the plan for a federal Europe.
Nonetheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency, have led many people to believe that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments operating with excessive budget deficits - this was only true for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has locked its members on exchange rates favorable to German exporters - which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe finds itself in a preliminary disadvantage in terms of production capabilities in comparison with Germany.
The only lifesaver is to cut wages and government spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies the deeper problem of Europe&#39;s productive capacity.
As a result of the green energy package implemented by Brussels - a cipher that subsidizes French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the US.
This is a paralyzing unfavorable price environment, as we saw in Grangemouth.
No amount of global wage freezes will stop the crushing victory of cheap US shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, a riot is brewing, especially in France, once the EU&#39;s most ardent supporter.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a vehicle for political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policies on Europe, leaving France&#39;s shattered economy in dire straits.
The result is that the right-wing, anti-EU National Front party, Marine Le Pen, has just won a decisive by-election, dropping the ruling Socialist Party in third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labor not to assume that a split among the right will automatically favor the left.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use next year&#39;s EU elections to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the common currency.
If - and this is very likely - anti-EU parties gain support in these elections, such a bloc could for the first time take a dominant position in the European Parliament.
Here&#39;s my opinion: Soon the growing anti-EU and anti-common currency sentiment in Europe will merge to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become something of the vague &quot;Europe of (sovereign) nations&quot; that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several economies dependent on it could keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
My guess is that the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
Nonetheless, Washington&#39;s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood of Britain being left behind in the cold Atlantic.
In what position does this leave Scotland?
We may choose to become a region of (essentially) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, send Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland can do well with a freer European deal, provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in the non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating the Norwegian experience and maintaining our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is - oddly enough - the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, winning an impressive majority in 2011 thanks to objections to spending cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labor Chancellor of the Treasury, Alistair Darling, and emerging subsequently a coalition of Tories and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ludicrous for Scotland now to vote for independence only to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Australian Woman Appeals Against Prison Term In Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for falsely claiming that she was attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by the Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 for filing a false lawsuit after Thai police reported that a local taxi driver carried out an attack on the night of Sunday June 10, while two other men held her.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she safely returned to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.
Prior to her trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a general regime detention center on the outskirts of Phuket, not in an adult women&#39;s prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who turned to the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was &quot;extremely concerned&quot; for their daughter&#39;s well-being and were looking forward to her return to Australia.
“Obviously it was a worrying time, but we hope she gets home safely as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on baht 50,000 bail.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently on holiday in the Krabi resort area of southern Thailand.
Thai-based legal sources said Bamford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could result in a court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve an adult prison sentence.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be looking to restore its damaged tourist image, leading to an acquittal.

Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
This was stated to journalists by Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei at a press conference following a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, BelTA has learned.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in the development and deepening of Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we agreed that the government bodies of the two countries will provide widespread assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts with each other, ”said Vladimir Makei.
He stressed that the government of Belarus will create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The minister also said that the 8th session of the Belarusian-Turkish joint intergovernmental economic commission was held in Ankara, following which a protocol was signed.
The parties have worked out a roadmap of the Belarusian-Turkish interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in the trade, economic and investment fields, in the spheres of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as at finding new forms and areas of interaction.
&quot;The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be fulfilled, because Belarus and Turkey regard each other as reliable partners,&quot; he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, said that during the talks, the heads of the foreign ministries of the two countries decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
The trade turnover between Belarus and Turkey, according to the minister, needs to be increased and brought to the figure of $ 1 billion.

On October 31, Barnaul policemen identified two gaming halls.
The first one worked in the Industrial District on Vzletnaya Street.
At the time of the check, the game was in progress.
The club counted 24 machines.
Another gaming club was found in the Leninsky district on Anton Petrov street.
20 slot machines were used here.
The Russian MIA Administration for Barnaul informs that administrative materials have been drawn up under the article &quot;Illegal organization and conduct of gambling&quot;.
The equipment was seized.
In the near future, materials on these facts will be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Leninsky districts of the city.
Driving schools will be able to conduct driving exams
Driving license exams will be able to be taken by private companies that have their own computerized race track.
Writes about this &quot;Kommersant&quot; with reference to the draft government decree &quot;On admission to drive vehicles.&quot;
According to the newspaper, currently in Russia there are only about 30 such autodromes.
It is assumed that the students of such &quot;privileged&quot; driving schools will be credited with the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Traffic Inspectorate will monitor the passing of exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of exams in theory and more than 20% of the site are not passed by students the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for motor racing tracks, contained in the draft government decree, come into force on November 5, 2014.
The project also contains requirements for teaching two-wheeled vehicles.
From January 1, 2015, motorcycle owners will have to pass an exam in urban traffic to obtain a Category A license.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign driving license.
Such workers will have to obtain Russian license after passing the exam.
Early puberty: aging earlier
African American and Latino girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, studies show.
Physical changes don&#39;t mean puberty is near
No evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame
Experts believe the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children&#39;s health and family issues.
Should a mother be intimidated if her daughter begins to form the rudiments of the mammary gland and grow pubic hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent the new normal.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents — that usually doesn&#39;t mean full puberty quickly,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and axillary hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight shift in the age of menarche (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the median age is 12.5 years old, down from 12.75 in 1970.
“Once breasts begin to develop, it is at least two to three years before menarche,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of Early Puberty in Girls: Coping with This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but is considered “premature” when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in height up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or pause - this is something that the pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progression may warrant testing by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to stunted growth and stunted growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child&#39;s age, developmental level, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with medications, but admits that &quot;suppressing puberty can alleviate the behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from their peers.&quot;
Another big problem is clear: Parents simply don&#39;t want their very young daughters to have periods.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman, whose daughter started menstruating at age 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about her period, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school terrified and upset that she was the first among her friends.
There are many highly publicized theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
In boys - as in girls - puberty occurs earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the premise that carries the most weight is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls aged 6 to 9 that linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other evidence supports this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African American and Latino girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are various explanations.
Around the world, early puberty appears to be influenced by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys develop facial and pubic hair at a younger age, the tendency towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair occurs even in babies and toddlers.
“We have to be careful about how we define true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, pediatric endocrinologist at Gorieb Children&#39;s Hospital in Morristown, NJ.
Parents should feel free to get directions from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This could mean an earlier conversation than expected,” Kaplowitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need reassurance that even when it happens early, the process is a normal part of life.
The head of Dagestan hears notes of extremism in the Kuban anthem
The football match between “Anji” and “Kuban” resulted in a political collision between the authorities of the Krasnodar Territory and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the Kuban anthem sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan, Ramazan Abdulatipov, on Thursday suggested that the republican parliamentarians go to court, because the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory allegedly echoes calls for interethnic hatred, in particular, calls for a war with the &quot;Basurmans&quot;.
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory, in our time, in 1995, this anthem was approved.
It&#39;s a shame, and no one is doing it.
&quot;I remember you here as a mother, an enemy, a basurman, we go to a mortal battle&quot; - why write down such words in a hymn, poison some believers on other believers, &quot;Parliament Speaker Khizri Shikhsaidov expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov.
RBS Suspends Two Forex Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders in its foreign exchange division, according to two people familiar with the situation, further confirmation that global regulatory scrutiny of alleged foreign exchange market manipulation is rapidly gaining momentum.
Several of the world&#39;s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are working with regulators in investigations into the world&#39;s largest financial market, which has a daily turnover of $ 5.3 trillion.
The two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended in an ongoing investigation that echoes the LIBOR manipulation scandal.
While declining to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed that it received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, those in the know said that RBS turned over the e-mail and instant messaging records that the former trader received and sent to the UK&#39;s regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
The trader, Richard Asher, retired from RBS in 2010 and is reportedly granted leave of absence in his current position as head of European spot forex trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week while Matt Gardiner, a former senior foreign exchange trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from his job by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
Mr. Usher&#39;s instant messaging contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to those familiar.
UBS reported this week that it took action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged foreign exchange manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators around the world - the European Commission, Finma, Swiss antitrust authority Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are considering allegations that bankers conspired to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also started internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks have been scanning instant messages and emails over the years looking for cases of wrongdoing.
News of the inspections has stirred up traders in a business that has been one of the largest sources of income for the trading divisions of investment banks in recent years, but this year, however, faced difficulties as the low volatility of currencies reduces favorable opportunities for dealers.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the severity of the situation by saying that the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is nearly impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say this is not always true.
Despite the huge volume of daily trading in the forex market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use by banks of their internal platforms means that &quot;you can start to influence the market at very little cost,&quot; the senior trader said.
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of its London Stock Exchange traders this week after causing nearly $ 6 million in losses late last year.
The bank has promptly notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue was successfully localized,” Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court upholds Obama&#39;s healthcare bill
The US Supreme Court ruled today that Barack Obama&#39;s landmark health care bill is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
In a 5 to 4 vote, the judges ruled that separate orders under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requiring citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine are constitutional under the government&#39;s tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2,700-page law and further ruled that a health care law requirement that states increase Medicaid compliance or they would lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally coercive.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business filed a lawsuit to block the bill.
Each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season, including prospective candidate Mitt Romney, was vigorously opposed to the law.

&quot;Russian March&quot; becomes more popular
On November 4, the Day of National Unity, a &quot;Russian March&quot; agreed with the mayor&#39;s office will take place in Moscow.
According to a poll by the Levada Center, support for the Russian Marches is growing - already 40% of citizens approve of the idea of holding them to varying degrees.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of citizens approve of the Russian Marches to varying degrees: 11% of them are definitely positive about such actions and 29% are “rather positive”.
The popularity of the idea of &quot;Russian Marches&quot; is gradually growing - in 2006, only 14% of Russians welcomed these actions, and in December 2010, the holding of such events was already supported by twice as many citizens (28%).
Only 7% of Russians have a &quot;definitely negative&quot; attitude to the &quot;Russian Marches&quot;, 19% - &quot;rather negatively&quot;.
Another 35% could not formulate their attitude to this action.
This year, the Moscow mayor&#39;s office has approved the holding of the &quot;Russian March&quot; of up to 15 thousand people in Lyublino, said the head of the security department of the capital, Alexei Mayorov.
This action of nationalists has been held every year on National Unity Day since 2005.
To the question of sociologists &quot;Have you heard that on November 4 in Russia&quot; Russian marches &quot;are held under the slogan of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia?&quot; three quarters (75%) of citizens answered negatively.
Now only every fifth Russian (20%) knows about this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, almost a third of citizens (31%) heard about the &quot;Russian Marches&quot;.
Recall that three years ago, on December 11, a spontaneous rally of nationalists took place on Manezhnaya Square, which escalated into riots.
The Levada Center also asked the Russians what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (National Unity Day) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of citizens are going to celebrate this holiday.
Approximately the same number (17%) intend to celebrate the October Revolution Day on November 7.
The majority of citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How the Moscow Mayor&#39;s Office approved the &quot;Russian March&quot; in Lyublino
On October 28, the city authorities agreed to hold the &quot;Russian March&quot; on November 4 in Lyublino.

The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20 thousand people, the Ministry of Internal Affairs called the figure 6 thousand.
Snowden declares his readiness to talk with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany in the case of wiretapping

The letter of the former CIA officer to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by the deputy of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele, through whom Snowden conveyed the message to the German authorities.
Strebele had met with Snowden in Moscow the day before.

Chechens beat and rob 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
The natives of Chechnya were arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.

The leader of the gang was a 27-year-old woman with a previous conviction, a native of Chechnya.
Venezuela will set the exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency - the bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported on November 1 by Bloomberg, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand US dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The specific exchange rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be set later.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
On the black market, however, one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
Oil Minister and Vice President for Economy Rafael Ramirez said on October 18 that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolívar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to depreciate the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of containing prices for food and consumer goods, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to a shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of a black foreign exchange market.
This spring, the media reported that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that US espionage has &quot;gone unseemly far&quot;
John Kerry has demonstrated a softening of the defense tactics of US surveillance programs, making an unprecedented admission that, in some cases, US espionage has &quot;gone unseemly far.&quot;
The secretary of state also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being &quot;on autopilot&quot; during Edward Snowden&#39;s high-profile revelations about NSA spying.
These leaks have put the US government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the government, actually perceived some of the things happening on autopilot, because the opportunity already existed - and during World War II, and during the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, September 11th. &quot;
He then became the first senior member of the US government to admit that US espionage went too far, but stressed that no one’s rights were violated.
He said, “In some cases it has gone unsuitablely far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain himself to the people, and now he is conducting a thorough analysis so that no one has a feeling of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process. &quot;
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was acting in good faith and that many lives had been saved by its tracking operations.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, bombing buildings and killing people, because we were able to know about these plans in advance. &quot;
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged US espionage abroad and persuade Europeans to continue joint counterterrorism efforts with the US, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about their threats to end their anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration with NSA surveillance.
“It is really important for US national security interests that Europeans remain our supporters in our common anti-terrorism effort,” First-term Democrat Murphy, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
&quot;And I&#39;m going to Europe to make it clear to them that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger at these NSA programs.&quot;
News that the NSA has collected millions of telephone tapes in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents released by Snowden showing that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s mobile phone, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended Allied espionage as necessary and said it was common on both sides.
Amid the buzz, Murphy said his office is organizing a congressional trip expected this year and that he hopes the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of other participating legislators are due to be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the trip program is still under development.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said some degree of &quot;well-meaning toughness&quot; would also be shown.
He said European leaders need to be honest with their people about what spyware they have used for years.
“While we can change our tracking programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to accept the fact that we are not the only ones doing intelligence activities,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is due to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address issues of hostility to US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US intelligence activities.
In the United States, a school principal shot at teenagers.
The directors of one of the American high schools were literally driven to despair by the teenagers.
The man, according to him, was forced to take a weapon and start shooting.
The incident took place in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile hooligans threw toilet paper at the man&#39;s house.
Because of this, the school director opened fire on the teenagers, as a result of which a 15-year-old boy received several wounds in the leg and arm.
Since the hooligans were not on the principal&#39;s property, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from prison on bail of $ 125,000.
Note that shooting at civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in the center of Ridgecrest in the US state of California right at passers-by on the street.
After that, the offender took two bystanders hostage, hid them in the trunk of a car and tried to escape.
Earlier in the elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, gunfire was opened.
Adam&#39;s mother worked at the school, she was a teacher.
American school shooting: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.
Chinese newspaper that published the call &quot;to be reorganized&quot;
The Chinese newspaper, which has published a front-page call for the release of a libel reporter, is due to be reorganized, the press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper made a surprise public statement asking for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes to write false articles about the state-owned company.
Now the &quot;New Express&quot; must go through a &quot;complete error correction process&quot;, as the regulator says.
The &quot;error correction&quot; order came from the Guangdong Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
A preliminary investigation revealed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group&#39;s Novy Express newspaper ran several false reports on the publicly traded company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial board of Novy Express was disoriented,” the regulator said in a statement.
He reports that a decision has been made to &quot;impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of revoking his reporter&#39;s license.&quot;
He also &quot;instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to fully correct the errors in Novy Express and recommended that it investigate the newspaper&#39;s officials involved in the situation and immediately make changes to the leadership of Novy Express.&quot;
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published on the front page two calls for his release, stating that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television admitting that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I hurt Zoomlion and the entire news media industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was hungry for money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
Following Mr. Chen&#39;s confessions, New Express published an apology on the front page, claiming that the newspaper had failed to properly verify his coverage.
Recently, several high-profile suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say the practice of extorting confessions in China is still widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to self-incriminate.
Due to the rampage of evil spirits, several schools and a hospital had to be closed
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of South Matabeleland had to be closed due to the fact that students were attacked by ... goblins.
According to a local elder, the children panicked and it was impossible to continue their studies.
The story of the goblins may sound like a child&#39;s invention to a European, but in Africa it is quite a serious argument for closing a school.
Adults are also afraid of evil spirits.
In the summer, for example, in Zimbabwe, a hospital was closed due to the fact that medical staff were also attacked by goblins.

The puppy was lucky enough to escape after being called in by fire brigades to pick him up and take him to safety, after somehow getting stuck at 50 feet on a dangerous ledge of a steep slope.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after being in a car accident Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, were at Flappit&#39;s quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They frantically searched for their missing dog and posted appeals on social media sites after it escaped to the quarry after a minor accident.
At about 2:15 pm Wednesday, a keen dog breeder spotted Ruby trapped 50 feet on a ledge in the quarry.
A tech rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station rushed to the scene, roped down to rescue Ruby, and used a carrier to lift her up the hill.
Rescue Team Specialist Andy Clayton said, &quot;She was in a precarious position.&quot;
She was right in the middle of a steep slope - 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She did not move a muscle during the rescue, she was completely frozen.
But she&#39;s fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
This was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
Rescue Officer Peter Lau said, &quot;Ruby is very lucky to be rescued.&quot;
There was a possibility that she could have received very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup, and it was determined that she was fine, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire said, &quot;It was scary to watch the rescue.&quot;
I couldn&#39;t believe she was there at all.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she was exhausted and passed out, she would most likely fall.
The firefighters were great.
It was very daring - what they did.
We are so grateful and every one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from Keatley added: &quot;We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there.&quot;
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can&#39;t believe she was there.
Think travel agents are a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
At Flight Center, the trend seems to be reversed.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record income from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel firm now expects its core gross annual profit before tax to be $ 325 to $ 340 million, up from a previous forecast of $ 305 to $ 315 million.
If current targets are met, this would represent a 12-17 percent increase from a record profit of $ 290.4 million in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Center made an 8 percent profit in the first half and started the second half with good performance, especially on non-business travel in Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, we have been operating profitably in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have record high earnings before interest and taxes for a full year,” he said.
&quot;This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which usually bring us the largest profits.&quot;
In Australia, leisure business rebounded in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Center&#39;s leisure business was doing well, while corporate clients were spending less.
Its US business has offset losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half, and is expected to generate profits for the third full year in a row.
Flight Center shares rose 3 cents yesterday to $ 38.20.
Estonian Defense Ministry website restored after attack by Ukrainian hackers
The work of the website of the Estonian Ministry of Defense has been restored after the morning cyberattack, the press service of the department reports.
According to the Deputy Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for Information and Administrative Issues, Taimar Peterkop, this was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly set everything up, by now the site has been restored.
&quot;The damage done to the ministry is minimal,&quot; Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to say who organized the attacks.
&quot;We will certainly analyze the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from this, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents,&quot; he admitted.
As a reminder, on November 1, the Anonymous Ukraine group posted an appeal online in which it confirmed the hacker attack on the website of the Estonian Defense Ministry and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We do not have to be servants of NATO.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member states.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be anyone&#39;s slave.
We stand for an independent Ukraine.
&quot;Hands off Ukraine,&quot; Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that a company of the marines of the Feodosia separate battalion of the Ukrainian marines will take part in the command and staff exercises of the NATO response forces Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Japan to discuss with Russia the issue of concluding a peace treaty
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
&quot;We would like to frankly exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty,&quot; Kishida said at the meeting.
The Japanese Foreign Minister recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and became bilateral.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation will meet Japan halfway in solving complex political issues, RIA Novosti writes.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today demanding the return of the lands lost after the Second World War to the country.
Cars drive around the Japanese capital, from which they hear over the loudspeaker: &quot;Return the northern territories!&quot;
The police do not stop the protesters, they make sure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and arrange a masquerade for our area.
Now I&#39;m more like a curmudgeon.
In the last two years, I have not volunteered to hand out candy in my apartment and, most likely, I will not start this year either.
However, statistics show that I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, the majority of Americans - 158 million to be exact - will be celebrating Halloween this year and will spend a total of $ 6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations.
The only thing I look forward to every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts $ 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent on suits.
Sexy inanimate items are hot this year.
Women no longer need to be sex workers; they can also be sexy foods such as pizza, hamburgers, or carrots.
As for the men, I think we&#39;ll see a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I&#39;m sure Daft Punk-style astronauts will make their way to our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most frequently searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
Perhaps there is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed up our dogs last year and to my surprise we weren&#39;t the only ones.
What&#39;s more, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $ 330 million this year on pet costumes.
This means a lot of funny hot dog dogs.
When it comes to candy, we are not trivial.
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That&#39;s about £ 600 million of Hershey chocolates, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers gummies and Clark Bar.
According to the US Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-craving children preparing to conquer our neighborhoods.
Moreover, we will buy and - let&#39;s not kid ourselves - eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only things we don&#39;t want to eat are corn-shaped sweets; yet, according to the National Association of Pastry Chefs, nearly £ 35m is sold on Halloween.
That&#39;s roughly 9 billion individual corn kernels.
This is a mystery that I have yet to solve.
Nothing captures the essence of Halloween like haunted houses.
They have terrific titles like Horror Beyond the Walls (which, by the way, is in a real prison), Howl and Scream, and House of Shock.
What&#39;s more, according to America Haunts, America has 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses generating about $ 500 million in revenue, as well as those stunning, nearly self-described photos that your friend posted on Facebook, and you can&#39;t remove, but then the guy you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like &quot;cool facial expression.&quot;
Finally, let&#39;s talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving Jack&#39;s lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, something we have been doing since childhood.
Luckily for us, the pumpkin baby fashion only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these pumpkins rather than sitting in them.
Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkins this year, according to the US Census Bureau.
Jack&#39;s lamp slowly drying on your porch likely came from Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
For more challenging tasks, visit Tim and Susan Matisdon in Napa, California and try carving something from their 2,032 pound pumpkin.
Bayern defender David Alaba became the best sportsman in Austria in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he overtook the representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third place was taken by ski jumper Gregor Schlierenzauer.
Last season, the 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian descent helped his team win the Champions League, the German Championship and Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
Two men committed suicide in Kineshma and district
Previously, one of the hanged had already attempted suicide.
On October 30, at about 1-00, in the village of Lugovoye at his place of residence, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he had previously attempted suicide.
What prompted the man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, committed suicide by hanging at his place of residence.
No signs of violent death were found, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs &quot;Kineshemsky&quot; reports.
Mick Jagger says he didn&#39;t flirt with Katy Perry when she was 18
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star revealed that she was the backing vocalist for Jagger&#39;s 2004 song Old habits die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with the veteran rocker and commented, &quot;He flirted with me when I was 18.&quot;
She added, &quot;It was a long time ago and he was very kind.&quot;
In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for the seventy-year-old Jagger said he &quot;categorically denies he ever hit on Katy Perry.&quot;
The spokesperson added, &quot;She may be confusing him with someone else.&quot;
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at # 1 this week.
US-Mexico tunnel for drug trafficking discovered, equipped with its own railway
Found one of the most difficult drug smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
The four feet by three feet of this tunnel has been described by US authorities as one of the most difficult secret passages they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, which zigzags nearly six football fields in length, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with inconspicuous warehouses, making it easy to stealthily load drugs onto trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were discreetly smuggled through it, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men, who, according to law enforcement officers, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are using extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico following the marijuana harvest in October, which presented drug cartels with the daunting task of quickly getting their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found an approximately 700 yards long passage equipped with rail tracks that ran from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Parents of a Georgia teen who died in a &quot;ludicrous accident&quot; believe their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a rolled-up sports mat in his high school gymnasium believe their son was killed, a family lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in an upright mat propped against the back of his high school gymnasium.
Lowndes County Sheriff&#39;s Office investigators have concluded that Johnson died in tragic accident, but the 17-year-old&#39;s family disputes this.
“They are absolutely convinced that their son was killed,” Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff says.
“They think it’s against logic, physics, and common sense,” Crump said.
They think this is a cover to protect the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag,” he said.
US lawyer Michael Moore said Thursday that he is conducting an official investigation into Johnson&#39;s death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What caused death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made the announcement at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I will study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds” for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that an initial autopsy revealed that Johnson died as a result of &quot;positional asphyxiation.&quot;
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, revealed a different cause of death.
“There are several issues that need to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to warrant a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson&#39;s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct him.
A spokesman for the Lowndes County Sheriff&#39;s Office was not available for comment when contacted Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered the authorities to release all CCTV footage seen by investigators.
The teen&#39;s parents said they hope the videos contain clues to how he died.
Pakistani authorities begin negotiations with local Taliban
Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy of this country in the UK, where Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The head of the Pakistani government made a statement on talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed issues of relations between Pakistan and India, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
&quot;The Prime Minister announced that a dialogue with the Taliban has begun,&quot; the Pakistani embassy in London said in a statement.
“He said he hoped and prayed that the dialogue would work in accordance with the Pakistani constitution,” the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but they operate independently of it in the northwestern regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are pushing for an Islamic state.
Earlier, the Islamabad government made attempts to start negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to dialogue.
It stated that it would negotiate only if the authorities would withdraw troops stationed in areas where the Taliban was operating to their permanent deployment sites, and also release the arrested Islamists from prisons.
Nawaz Sharif arrives in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Neftekhimik goalkeeper Matt Dalton declined to comment on Vladimir Krikunov&#39;s departure from the post of Nizhnekamsk mentor.
The goalkeeper believes that the acting head coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys great prestige among the players and will cope with his duties.
We remind that today &quot;Neftekhimik&quot; dismissed Krikunov.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov, - quotes Dalton RIA Novosti.
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will cope with the obligations imposed on him - I have no doubt about that.
He enjoys great prestige in the team; this young specialist definitely has a great future ahead of him.
Pawn shop owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is struggling
At a pawnshop in the Bendemir shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga pawns a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for his daughter&#39;s schooling.
“My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is invested there,” says Ms Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S $ 3,000 ($ 2,400) a month as a receptionist and her husband also works, the family&#39;s monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia - where household debt is on the rise - is such that ValueMax, where it is conducting its deal, is the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore stock exchange this week.
A jewelry secured loan is not just a quick way to get money (S $ 1,300 in Ms. Amirthaling&#39;s case), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% - just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or proof of salary and can disburse loans faster than banks.
Consequently, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel pressure from rising cost of living and rapidly rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth in the wake of the global financial crisis and cheap loans fueled by loose monetary policies in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to compensate for declining incomes as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s, a rating agency, indicated an increase in family leverage, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt to gross domestic product ratios in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists are also worried about Thailand&#39;s high consumer debt, which barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
Data on Thursday showed a continuing decline in exports and a weakening in consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that as prices rise, people in the middle and bottom [of the income scale] will look for ways to supplement their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Woon, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Record high gold prices in the past two years have intensified the rush with which people are pawning their personal belongings as they seize the opportunity to receive money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of items pledged at 200 pawnshops in the city-state are gold items.
People say, &quot;The price of gold looks good, let&#39;s pawn Grandma&#39;s gold chain and get it back next month.&quot;
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator EasyMoney has seen an increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemir branch and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax. ...
The company will fund the expansion using 60 percent of the S $ 66 million raised this week from a public offering on the Singapore stock exchange.
While some lenders have drew criticism for high interest rates, Ms Yeah says the pawnshop not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase debt directly.
“Clients are pawning items they already own, and monetizing personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The mortgage is gaining wider public acceptance as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
And at the same time, pawnshops are used not only by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches to pledge gold bars or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“These include high net worth individuals who need to borrow money short-term for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary financial difficulties,” says Ms Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Bashkiria can put up grain for auction not earlier than the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria, in the course of state procurement interventions, can put grain up for auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014, says the Minister of Agriculture of the republic Nikolai Kovalenko.
Today market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the market price is higher, there is demand.
&quot;Perhaps the grain will be put up for auction after the New Year,&quot; he said at a press conference yesterday.
The minister recalled that this year the sowing of agricultural crops for the 2013 harvest amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
550 thousand hectares were sown for the 2014 harvest (105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
The areas for winter wheat and triticale were increased, rye remained at the same level.
In the Voronezh region, a football fan was detained for breaking a window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o&#39;clock in the evening on October 29, at the Gryazi-Voronezh station, transport police officers removed from the passenger train two football fans - natives of the Moscow region.
Going to the game of their favorite team, the guys staged a drunken brawl on the train along the way.
The young people were taken to the duty section of the line police station at the Gryazi station to draw up a protocol on an administrative offense.
There, fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The police issued administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station began to wait for his arrival.
At half past midnight, the fans left the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, unexpectedly returned and kicked to smash the front door window in the station&#39;s waiting room.
A transport police officer and a security guard of the Russian Railways private security company rushed to the sound of the broken glass.
They managed to detain an intruder who was trying to escape from the scene.
The officers of the South-East LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia are checking.
The question of initiating a criminal case is being raised, said Sergei Olkhovik, senior assistant of the information and public relations department of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in transport.
Russian security officials do not know anything about the Bratskiy Krug group - Novye Izvestia
INTERFAX.RU writes about this with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
&quot;After the media reported that the US Treasury Department added Leps to the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Brothers Circle Eurasian crime syndicate, we looked through all the databases, but we did not find such a group,&quot; the source said.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth about the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As &quot;NI&quot; wrote earlier, yesterday the US Treasury Department published on its website a list of alleged members of the Bratskiy Krug criminal group.
Among them was the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He appears on the list as &quot;Grisha&quot;, posted the day before.
They coincide with the data of a popular Russian artist.
The exact name is indicated - Grigory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, five more people are mentioned there.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another from the former USSR, whose citizenship is not indicated.
In the United States, they are sure that Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported money for the bandits on their order.
A photograph of the singer is attached to this message and all his data are indicated, which correspond to reality.
Moreover, Leps actually bought a house in Phuket recently.
The department noted that they intend to impose sanctions against Leps.
The inclusion of a person on the blacklists of the US Treasury Department entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with persons residing in the United States.
Leps&#39;s assistant Maya Serikova said that the singer had not received any notifications: &quot;It is difficult to answer the question of whether this is Grigory that everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States.&quot;
All that Leps knows is information from the media.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I don&#39;t know if they happen in such cases.
&quot;And, of course, this is all, on the one hand, funny, but on the other, surprising and unexpected,&quot; she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live in Phuket, but, according to the US Treasury, he does have a house on a Thai island.
She stated that Leps is now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him while flying to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Is there a black box in your car?
As American road designers scramble to raise money to repair a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box neatly stuck to your car&#39;s dashboard.
These devices, which track every mile a motorist travels and relay this information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planners to modernize America&#39;s outdated highway financing system.
The normally boring arena of highway planning has unexpectedly spawned intense debate and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government to use small boxes to track how many miles you drive, and perhaps even where you drive them - and then use that information to compile tax bills.
The tea drinking movement is shocked.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions regarding privacy.
And while Congress has yet to agree on whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They ponder how, over the next decade, they can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes for testing, some of which have satellite tracking functionality.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not an issue where we can have a choice,” said Hasan Ihrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which is preparing plans to start tracking the miles every California motorist drives by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
The technologies for this already exist.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Fund for the construction of highways, funded by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans are no longer buying as much gas as they used to.
Cars travel more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents a gallon, hasn&#39;t been raised in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise taxes even one cent on high gasoline prices.
&quot;The gas tax just can&#39;t be saved,&quot; said Lee Mannich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed 500 tracking devices on vehicles to test the martyrdom payment system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long term,” he said.
The nerds call it the user fee.
Unsurprisingly, this idea is appealing to urban liberals, since taxes can be used to alter travel patterns to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
California planners are looking at the system as they develop strategies to meet the targets set by the state&#39;s ambitious global warming laws.
However, Rep. Bill Schuster (Rp, PA), chairman of the House Transport Committee, said he, too, sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free market advocates at Reason are also thrilled to make drivers pay for every mile.
“This is not just a tax that will go into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of political affairs for Reason.
People pay directly for what they receive.
The move is also supported by two former US Transportation Secretaries, who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards grave payments.
The US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year, which would have involved about 10,000 vehicles.
However, House leaders rejected the proposal because of concerns from rural legislators representing voters who often have to travel miles in their daily lives to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, are following this path on their own.
The enthusiasm is greatest in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are recruiting to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon be paying the state for miles instead of gasoline taxes.
In Nevada, a pilot project has already been completed.
In New York, he is being considered.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis involving trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes transportation departments in 17 east coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is exploring how they can make the change.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer vehicles were recently fitted with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track their every move.
“Concerns about Big Brother and things like that are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
This was not what people wanted.
As testing was underway, the American Civil Liberties Union&#39;s Nevada chapter warned on its website, &quot;It won&#39;t be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices.&quot;
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states struggling to find low-cost technology that would allow state governments to keep track of miles traveled by a car, but without information about the place and time.
If you can do this, Khan said, society will feel more relaxed.
The quest for this technology led some state agencies to a small fledgling company in California called True Mileage.
This company was not originally involved in helping to collect state taxes.
She aimed to enter the emerging market for a form of car insurance in which drivers pay on a mileage basis.
But the devices she tests appeal to road planners because they don&#39;t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically downloaded via a modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don&#39;t track their speed and location,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There were some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they might ditch the device altogether, choosing instead to pay a flat fee based on the average miles driven by all residents in the state.
Elsewhere, they hope to sell the idea to a wary public by forcing devices to do more, not less.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a taxation device that will also accept payment for parking meters, provide pay-as-you-drive insurance, and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
&quot;Motorists will be attracted to the participation of the benefits that will be offered to them,&quot; - says the document of urban planning.
Some transportation system designers, however, are wondering if all the talk of gratuity payments is just a huge distraction.
At the City Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Highway Building Trust by raising gas taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid drivers and others whose vehicles do not use a lot of gas to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when all you have to do is take an aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission on Law and Public Relations.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a host of other things.

Pope Francis will ordain the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the popes, so that Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the selection of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after the cardinal reaches 80 years of age, he can no longer take part in the election of the pope - this is the prerogative of a group of 120 &quot;cardinals-electors&quot;.
Announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that a meeting of all current cardinals, known as the consistory, would be held prior to the ordination ceremony.
“Pope Francis decided to communicate in advance his decision to convene the consistory in February in order to facilitate the scheduling of other meetings with cardinals from around the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors is likely to decline by February.
He said that usually the pope names as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of elective cardinals back to 120, as well as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
The consistory next year will go a long way because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March this year, according to Valero.
At the moment, there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore the balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by an insignificant number of cardinals.
They will also be the first elected cardinals since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, dad decided everything himself.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we were not in such a situation before - all this for us for the first time.
Valero said that popes used to elevate bishops from large parishes to the office of cardinal, but Francis &quot;is full of surprises - so we do not know who he will name.&quot;

Tax for foreign property owners will set the London bubble to burst
The Treasury has performed a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a government tax rate of 7% for homes over £ 2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own houses in a partnership, not as individuals.
The state tax on residential properties in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which was £ 708 million in fiscal 2012/13, now exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and Humbert combined. taken.
Mr. Cook said: &quot;With the increase in the state tax on high-value homes and the introduction of related anti-evasion legislation, it is very difficult to argue that taxation of high-value real estate is understated, regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.&quot;
“But this move could lead to the fact that some foreign investors will be reluctant to buy property in London or its current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
Premium real estate - the top 5-10% of the housing market by value - in London&#39;s affluent southwest belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has grown by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London continued to grow at a steady 5.6% year-on-year, according to a Savills study, but were overshadowed by a booming “home market” with price spikes in the Southwest, North (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city.
The next meeting of the Tyumen Region Machine Builders Association was held on the basis of the Yalutorovsk Automobile Plant.
As part of the event, a presentation of a new line for the production of electric-welded steel pipes was held.
As the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov said, in 2011, with the advent of a new owner, a marketing study was carried out to study the sales market for steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electric-welded pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment for their production.
Already this year, more than 7 thousand tons of manufactured products have been shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to over 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
A new mill was launched in October, which makes it possible to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small pipe profile, which is used for heating, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large one for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will be about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to a different type of activity, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, while the plans for the purchase of new equipment are to increase the personnel by more than 50 employees.
The company is retraining personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new slitting line for steel with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as one more mill, with a pipe production rate of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the enterprise intends to master the production of pipes that are used in housing and communal services.
The management of the enterprise sets the task to cover up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region in these products.
Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department Leonid Ostroumov, addressing production managers, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
The forms of state support for industry are also aimed at this, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
This year, it is planned to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider subsidy agreements, accepts documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For next year, the budget provides for funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million - for energy saving programs.
Reduced to 72 million rubles funds to reimburse the ordered and paid for equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future, this form of support will end, since the motive for its introduction was compensation for the tax on the extraction of minerals, which the oil companies paid to the regional budget.
Currently, they do not do this, and subsidies become direct expenditure obligations of the region.
Taking this into account, the regional government considers direct support to industrial enterprises as a priority, rather than financing the oil industry through them.
Budget assistance will be associated with investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the emerging situation in relations with oil workers.
The subsidy for the equipment they buy is a competitive advantage for the industry in the south of the Tyumen region, and if it is canceled, it will be difficult to compete in price with central Russia, where labor is cheaper.
In addition, the issue of the succession of the new owner of TNK-BP - Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders with Tyumen enterprises - is unclear.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and no application for its extension has been received.
Currently, enterprises in the south of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
The question remains open whether taxes from oil produced in the Uvat region will go to the regional budget or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
The II Congress of the Peoples of the Southern Urals was held in Chelyabinsk.
The forum is timed to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of the Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national-cultural associations, religious confessions, legislative and executive authorities - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening interethnic harmony.
Here we can set an example not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no discrepancies and disagreements.
We live in complete mutual understanding, &quot;says Theophanes, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoust.
During the meeting, a number of issues were considered, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
At the end of the congress, a resolution was adopted.
The unofficial part of the forum continued at the Opera and Ballet Theater.
An exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, watchdog team says
Syria has destroyed basic chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, an international watchdog team said Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites believed to contain toxic substances.
Also Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the country&#39;s civil war nearly three years ago.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons statement was made one day before
the November 1 deadline set by this Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or “render inoperative” all chemical weapons production and mechanisms that allow chemicals to be mixed into poison gas and filled with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all Damascus chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nonetheless, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have around 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came during fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts say contains a chemical weapons production facility and storage sites, according to the UK-based Syrian Human Rights Center.
A group of activists that tracked losses through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, the group said, 29,954 are members of President Bashar al-Assad&#39;s armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among the dead, according to the statement, were 2,202 army defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to a UN estimate dated July 25, 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict has forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad&#39;s forces have fought for weeks in Safir with insurgents, many of whom are associated with al-Qaeda groups.
The center said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific details.
The fighting highlighted the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal, amid the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said in a statement that its team was &quot;now satisfied that it has checked and seen destroyed all Syrian-declared critical production facilities and mixing / filling equipment.&quot;
She added that &quot;no additional inspection activities are currently planned.&quot;
Inspectors said earlier this week that they completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites Damascus has declared.
They were unable to visit two locations for security reasons, inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said both sites were, according to Syria, &quot;abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items in them have been moved to other declared locations that have been verified.&quot;
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the Safir site was one of two locations that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved next month by the OPCW&#39;s executive committee.
“I applaud the courage and bravery that you all have shown in carrying out the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Observatory Director General Ahmet Uzumcu in a comment posted by the OPCW.
For the third year in a row, the civil war has pitted insurgents, mostly Sunni Muslims, against the Assad government and its security forces, which are made up of members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam.
In other developments, head of the center Rami Abdurrahman said there was a massive explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in Syria&#39;s coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Message: Obama Campaign Considered Expelling Biden In Favor Of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, closest advisers to President Barack Obama have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 election list.
The revelation is the brightest sensation in the much-anticipated 2012 book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the Stakes Doubled: The Game Changed 2012 campaign.
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday night that top presidential aides conducted &quot;extensive focus group research and opinion polls in late 2011&quot; to assess whether Biden&#39;s expulsion could help raise dying hopes for re-election. Obama.
According to The Times political columnist Jonathan Martin, the book details an attempt by senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daly, to gauge the effect the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton would have on the vote.
The eventual replacement was a secret, closely guarded at the Chicago campaign headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president&#39;s closest aides - including Daly, former Obama chief of staff Jim Messina and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff - knew a replacement was being considered.
Stakes Doubled argues that Daley spearheaded an attempt to replace Biden despite their &quot;close personal relationship&quot; but ultimately backed out when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not &quot;significantly improve Obama&#39;s chances. &quot;.
In an interview with Martin, Daly confirmed that the administration did indeed consider replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I was actively advocating for considering a lot of things, and this was one of them,” Daily told the newspaper.
You have to remember that at that moment the President was in terrible shape, so we thought, &quot;Oh my God, what do we do?&quot;
Although Daly described the study as &quot;a necessary scrutiny,&quot; Martin told CNN spokesman Anderson Cooper that the campaign team has invested quite a lot in examining whether the move will pay dividends in the vote.
“Campaigns don&#39;t spend that kind of money on polls and focus groups if they don&#39;t take something seriously,” Martin said on the AK 360 program.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was looking into a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daly if his then-boss knew about the possible reshuffle.
Although Daly said he did not think the president was &quot;aware&quot; of a possible replacement, the former chief of staff admitted that Obama &quot;probably knew.&quot;
Martin added that &quot;The stakes are doubled&quot; does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether the results of political probing have reached the Obama table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama was not aware of the study to remove Biden from the electoral list.
“Possibly,” Martin replied.
The head of the control and disciplinary committee of the RFU Artur Grigoryants said that “Kuban” was fined 500 thousand rubles, the correspondent of “SE” Philip PAPENKOV reports from the House of Football.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for setting the flag of Dagestan on fire by fans in the stands during the 14th round home match against Anji.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from the Premier League.
We researched all available materials.
For improper behavior of spectators “Kuban” was fined 500 thousand rubles.
Legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to their estimates, the consumption of beer in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is at best.
Although businessmen initially counted on growth.
After all, this year is not going well for them: sales fell by 7 percent.
Isaac Sheps, the head of one of the country&#39;s largest brewing companies, chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers, told about all this at the third annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute &quot;FMCG in Russia&quot;, which just ended in Moscow.
It discussed state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already shrunk by 18 percent, since in recent years there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in the country in terms of the production and turnover of beer - a drink with a low alcohol content, - Sheps told listeners.
No other country in the world has such a strict restriction on the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of more and more illogical bans, which are supposedly justified by the fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer lamented that many legislative bans designed to reduce alcohol abuse do not have much impact, nevertheless, new initiatives are constantly appearing.
Most of all, beer producers were hit by the ban introduced this year from selling alcohol in kiosks.
“We immediately lost 35 thousand consumers,” said Isaac Sheps.
The brewers have two forecasts for the next year.
The optimistic one is the one Sheps talked about: sales of the foamy drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 percent.
In order to keep their profits, businessmen are forced to move away from beers designed for the mass consumer to the &quot;premium&quot; class: there will be less beer, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of the drop in sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
&quot;According to my observations, the level of alcoholism diseases remains at about the same level,&quot; said the narcologist Alexei Sotnikov.
True, the proportion of patients who use surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who are &quot;addicted&quot; to alcohol-containing tonic drinks like &quot;Jaguar&quot;, has increased, whereas ten years ago it was &quot;beer&quot; alcoholism that prevailed.
What will the construction of TPU in Moscow lead to?
Every year the city authorities promise to equip more and more transport interchange hubs (TPU).
By 2020, it is planned to commission 255 TPUs.
Our correspondent figured out what the project actually turns out to be.
A couple of months ago, a construction fence appeared near the Smolenskaya metro station of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.
The inscription said that the arrangement of the transport interchange hub was underway.
All this was very strange, since no ground transport stops near &quot;Smolenskaya&quot; and, therefore, it is impossible to change to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you need to overcome about 130 meters, including the ground crossing over Karmanitsky Lane.
Now &quot;Smolenskaya&quot; is almost finished.
The flower stall has disappeared, the newspaper stand has been dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance has been replaced by paving stones.
That&#39;s the whole transport hub.
Transport hubs are flat and capital, - explain in the press service of the Moscow Department of Transport.
There are no capital TPUs yet.
And flat ones involve the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of shopping facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and landscaping.
Actually, it is not transport workers who are even engaged in flat-bed TPUs, but professional organizers from the Moscow Department of Overhaul.
A transport hub is not necessarily a complex structure, explains Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy at the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes it is enough to have a roof over your head and a board informing you about the time of arrival of the vehicle.
For example, a fully-fledged plane transfer hub was recently opened near the Yasenevo metro station.
Even without awnings, but with intercepting parking lots and scoreboards indicating when the bus will come.
But in pursuit of the quantity, officials write down everything they hit at TPU.
Back in 2011, the mayor&#39;s office planned to build 151 nodes for everything, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now the plans until 2020 include as many as 255 TPUs.
Of these, one and a half hundred promise to pass this year.
Although the city has a program for the development of TPU, no quality criteria have been identified, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization &quot;City and Transport&quot;.
They report on the number of objects, but the quality of transplantation at each of them often deteriorates.
According to the expert, there should be two criteria: firstly, reducing the transplant time, and secondly, convenience.
First of all, the ability to change the mode of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, when arranging a TPU, it sometimes turns out exactly the opposite.
A striking example of the VDNKh metro station.
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslavskoe highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the All-Russian Exhibition Center.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to Kosmonavtov Street.
Farther from the metro, much farther from the monorail, but closer to residential buildings.
Even though the residents did not want the bus station under the windows at all and complained to all possible authorities.
Somehow it didn&#39;t work out right away with capital TPUs in Moscow.
The first of them began to be built about five years ago at the Planernaya metro station.
The project was intended to be exemplary.
And it really turned out to be an example of how a transfer hub, left to the mercy of investors, turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there are platforms for buses, a canopy to keep out of the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.
True, Khimki trolleybuses # 202 and # 203 were not given a place in the Moscow TPU.
They, like strangers, were pushed away from the metro.
But there is more room for trade.
There are 32 stores alone, but in general there is almost everything - from pet supplies to a car dealership.
Well, in fact, what if any of the bus passengers need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital TPU, for some reason we always get a shopping center.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion, when it was decided to give part of the parking lot for the market.
Now, on the third floor of the Planernaya TPU, there is a brisk trade among the parking spaces marked on the floor.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian language and security guards glaring at our photographer.
The transfer hub has finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that there used to be a market near the Planernaya metro station, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, the traders were sorry and let them into the intercepting parking lot of the interchange hub.
Anyway, due to high prices, it is always empty.
The funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build in its place ... a new plane TPU.
Such is the castling.
At the Kaluzhskaya metro station, the approach distance from the metro lobby to the bus was 50 meters, ”says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of a shopping center, supposedly a TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you need to walk through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to go around it in the open air.
However, the structures at Planernaya and Kaluzhskaya will soon seem like flowers.
In mid-September, the city planning and land commission of the mayor&#39;s office approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital transport hubs.
Four of them will be 25-storey, not counting two or three underground levels.
The main monster will grow up near the Tushino metro station, it will have 418.7 thousand square meters. meters of area.
Representatives of the directorate of railway stations of Russian Railways, who are responsible for the construction of a TPU near the metro, have already told reporters: the future high-rise buildings will house shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials assure that multi-storey parking will occupy from a third to a half of the area.
Take people&#39;s garages as an example.
Let&#39;s say a garage for 258 cars, which was recently built on Mezhdunarodny Street, has an area of 8015 sq. meters.
This means that a parking lot for 2.6 thousand cars at Petrovsko-Razumovskaya will need about 80 thousand squares.
This is less than a third of the colossus they are going to build there.
Let one or two floors go to all sorts of bus platforms.
Remains at least 150 thousand square meters. meters of commercial real estate.
And this, for a minute, is almost two GUM.
If capital TPUs near stations and railway stations are built by railway workers, then the rest of the sites will be developed by metro workers.
They also promised that there will be many &quot;functional facilities&quot;, including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, the Moscow City Property Department recently told reporters that they are developing a draft resolution, according to which investors will be able to apply for a land plot for TPU to officials directly.
Without any competitions.
Because, they say, transport issues are a priority for the city.
An ideal TPU is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston or the Spadine station in Toronto, - Alexander Morozov is sure.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the metro level and the approach distance from the metro car to the tram is only 50 meters without going outside.
There is no unnecessary trade around.
But he takes Moscow officials to extremes.
Either we won&#39;t build anything, or we&#39;ll have 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Oil fell in price to $ 96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, as concerns over large stockpiles overshadowed reports that China&#39;s energy-intensive manufacturing sector was gaining momentum.
The US benchmark for December delivery fell 14 cents to $ 96.24 a barrel late morning European time in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell 39 cents, which totaled a 5.8 percent drop in October prices.
The rich reserves of oil have affected its price in recent weeks.
The Energy Department said Wednesday that US stocks increased 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, reserves were replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible rise in demand, judging by two reports of Chinese industry showing a surge in activity.
This indicates that the Chinese economic recovery may continue to gain strength after the third-quarter growth rate climbed to 7.8 percent after a twenty-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent, a benchmark international grade used by US refiners as well, dropped 26 cents to $ 108.58 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, the police are looking for a criminal who brutally killed two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As the press service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation for the Sverdlovsk Region told &quot;Novy Region&quot;, on the eve of the day in the Kirovsky district of the Ural capital, after extinguishing a fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential building on Uralskaya Street, the bodies of two women with signs of violent death were found.
Soon the identities of the victims were established.
It turned out that these are sisters, one of them is a 44-year-old resident of Yekaterinburg, the second is a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
They rented a burnt down apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under personal control by the chief police officer of the region, Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs bodies are working out various versions of the murder, checking the alibis of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established for what purpose the women rented an apartment, and where they lived before that, what they did, with whom they maintained relations.

Avangard coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the KHL regular championship match against Salavat, noted that Omsk had a thorough analysis of the defeat from Metallurg Magnitogorsk.
The specialist emphasized that Avangard needs to pay increased attention to playing on the defensive.
We watched the video of the match against Metallurg Magnitogorsk, - the official website of Avangard quotes Chebaturkin as saying.
- We conceded a lot of goals, not a very pleasant moment.
They missed it because of their mistakes, because of the failure to complete the game task.
We knew that the opponent had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks on the move - they scored three goals.
Very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account when preparing for today&#39;s game?
The guys and I carefully analyze each match, talk after the game, prepare for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is carried out.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The game task was completed, and the score was 2: 0.
We conceded a goal “into the dressing room” - and in the third period we began to make mistakes.
Considering how difficult the game was, I saw no point in involving the defenders.
The whole team must defend themselves.
Now &quot;Vanguard&quot; has a long home streak, matches are going on every other day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now is the realization of your moments and the completion of the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you follow the set - everything is not so difficult to solve.
Bombardier&#39;s profits decline as shipments and aircraft orders drop
Bombardier Corp., a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 percent cut in net profit on Thursday, impacted by declining orders and aircraft shipments in the third quarter and contract problems at its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier has also not released any flight test data for its newest CSeries aircraft, or provided new information on whether the aircraft&#39;s ambitious plans to enter commercial service by next September will be met.
Since the first flight of the prototype aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it has flown only three more times, which raises questions about whether the testing phase is on schedule.
The results fell short of forecasts and led to shares falling more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, cut his estimate Thursday from above-market to “market-average” on the belief that stock gains will be limited in the next quarter or two.
“While the decline in aircraft shipments was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the transport department&#39;s earnings performance,” Doerksen said in a stock market review.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to gain a foothold in the lower-price segment of the market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype aircraft was presented in March and flew for the first time in September after several months of delay.
However, there are still few firm orders for the CSeries at 177, as potential buyers await flight test results to validate the company&#39;s claims about fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
In total, there are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 clients and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Baudouin was confident that Bombardier would meet its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft went into commercial service.
Executives also reassured analysts and the media Thursday that the program is moving forward as planned.
&quot;The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,&quot; Baudoin said during a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft&#39;s downtime.
All manufacturers plan tests differently.
We decided to make the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will continue throughout the flight test program.
The second of five test specimens is due to fly in the coming weeks, and the rest will follow shortly, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical about the claim that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it is evaluating the commissioning timeline and will provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight testing - although it appears to be in line with Bombardier&#39;s internal schedule - reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier&#39;s net income fell to $ 147 million, or 8 cents a share, from $ 172 million, or 9 cents a share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same at 9 cents.
Gross income decreased slightly - from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion.
Analysts were expecting earnings of 10 cents a share and gross income of $ 4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The world&#39;s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, down from 57 in the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
Aerospace&#39;s order book was $ 32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
“In aerospace, the results were in line with our goals, but the low order volume and general market conditions were an unpleasant factor,” Baudouin said.
Aerospace gross revenue fell 13 percent to $ 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world&#39;s largest train maker, reported that gross revenue in the sector rose nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion.
The order book in the transportation division was $ 32.6 billion as of September 30, slightly higher than on December 31.
The transport division&#39;s earnings were negatively impacted by problems with the execution of several large contracts.
Management announced that a new development plan will be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier, which also announced that Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Picchett will join the board of directors, fell 8.5 percent to from $ 4.83 in mid-Thursday trading.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world&#39;s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10 percent decrease in quarterly revenue on Thursday.
A certificate was stolen from the chairman of the Krasnoyarsk court, hitting him on the head
Unknown persons attacked the chairman of the Krasnoyarsk regional court Vladimir Dvoekonko, stealing his identity card.
As reported by &quot;Interfax&quot;, late on Wednesday evening, the attackers hit the judge on the head, causing him to faint.
When the 63-year-old chairman of the court came to his senses, he found that his service card had been pulled out.
The criminals did not take money and other valuables.
Dvoekonko made it home on his own, and turned to the police only the next day.
The crime is being investigated and the criminals are being searched.
Israeli warplanes attack targets inside Syria, senior official said
A senior administration official confirmed in an interview with Fox News that Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel launched airstrikes on missile cargo inside Syria.
Thorium - Nuclear Power&#39;s New Hope?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet energy needs.
Burning hydrocarbons (where available) negatively affects the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas to generate.
Nuclear energy does without both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste to recycle.
Recently, scientists have paid attention to thorium - another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and, according to experts, its splitting leaves no waste that must be stored for centuries.
New machines will appear in the Moscow metro.
But they will sell tickets to passengers not for money, but for squats.
One trip costing 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger 30 squats.
The number of squats will be counted by a special device using modern technology, ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first apparatus will be installed at the Vystavochnaya station on November 8, 2013.
The presentation of the new ticket machines will be hosted by the President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zhukov, and Olympic gymnasts Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova.

Two YMCA staff members have been charged with sex offenses prior to the charges against Jonathan Lord as reported to the Royal Commission
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with child sex offenses prior to the 2011 charges against Karingbach childcare worker Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse reported.
But the commission&#39;s opening statement said that it &quot;has never dealt with child sexual abuse within its organization.&quot;
CEO Philippe Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography crimes and another case where a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sex crimes against children in his care in 1991. year.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, an attorney assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA was also inaccurate in its opening speech to the commission, arguing that &quot;there were external YMCA reviews that found the YMCA to be at the forefront of child safety.&quot;
The evidence presented to the commission suggests that the YMCA was notified that it received the second-lowest out of four possible ratings in a quality audit performed by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that he and lower management blundered in hiring Lord, and failed to ensure that staff clearly understood their responsibilities regarding reporting child safety violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sex crimes against 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was jailed for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare dismissed the suggestion that the YMCA&#39;s corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord&#39;s child safety violations.
The officers testified that they observed violations, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, personally looked after them, put them on his lap, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Oakwell, who was under Lord&#39;s direction and asked to teach her child protection because she was worried about his behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnath, the child custody manager of the YMCA in Karingbach, who was Lord&#39;s leader, “very frightening and often difficult to access &quot;.
The CEO said he would not accept employee explanations that they were embarrassed to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with the Lord took them away from the thought of reporting him.
Mr. Hare said that he presented to the NSW YMCA his view that the lesson for organizing from the “Jonathan Lord incident” is not “about providing information” from the staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations were raised was made by YMCA Child Custody Director Liam Wheatley.
He said that this was intended to prevent corruption of evidence, but at the same time &quot;overdoing&quot; and this decision was poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a child-safe organization when Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011, child molestation expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission.
He said there were &quot;serious problems&quot; in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and supervising personnel.
The hearings have been postponed until December 20.
Guillaume Niklou&#39;s adaptation of Denis Diderot&#39;s novel boasts exceptional production and historical detail, but it is also harder to take than it should.
Set in 1760s France, the film tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of the sadistic abbess and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never sinks to vulgarity or sensation - and that&#39;s the whole problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the story runs the risk of being a hair-shirt-like test for the audience.
US intelligence services wiretapped the personal phone of the Pope
The activities of the Vatican are under the vigilant control of the American intelligence services.
New documents from the collection of Edward Snowden indicate that US intelligence was listening to all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now closely patronizing Pope Francis.
His phone was tapped even before he became head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new pope was also monitored.
What was given special importance in the United States.
The secret service connected to the cell phones of the cardinals, who had gathered in Rome to elect the next Pope.
The phones of the residence where the conclave participants lived were also tapped.
American spies tapped all the main contenders to the papal throne in order to prevent the appearance of an unwanted figure for Washington.
Panorama magazine writes that the &quot;big ear of the United States&quot; continued to intercept the prelates&#39; conversations until the end of the conclave on March 12th.
It is alleged that in the United States since 2005, the Argentine Archbishop Bergoglio has been singled out as the future Pope of Rome.
American intelligence also monitored negotiations related to the election of a new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continues to work in the Roman US Embassy, extracting information about politicians and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican conciliatoryly announced that it does not care about the American &quot;wiretapping&quot;, even if it does occur.
The Holy Fathers have no secrets from the US leadership.
Ben Greenman: New York Comedy Festival 10th Anniversary: The New Yorker
It can be safely argued that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a century ago, entertainer Frank Fay, who worked as an entertainer at the Palace Theater on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Fay&#39;s innovation was eventually picked up by others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started out with the Carolines and then they got better, they got to the point where they’re too famous to be in the club,” said Hersch.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year&#39;s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as Stand Up For Heroes, an annual musical comedy benefit concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, among others. , Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy also expanded.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year have gained popularity in unconventional ways, such as through shows on small TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose to fame for his role in a comedy series on a little-known cable TV channel (the deliberately obscene FXX League of fantasy football), and now hosts his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate has been cast on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, though she is best known for her viral series of Marseille - Shell in Boots.
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with distinctive styles (surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Gesellnik, sly, racially focused Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg&#39;s interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian but went on to become a successful television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place at the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely the centerpiece of all of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks along some street between two houses and thinks: &quot;Now, if I am left completely without money, perhaps I will live here.&quot;
