The number of recruits from Ukraine preparing to be sent to Donbass has been named
The official representative of the People&#39;s Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People&#39;s Republic (LPR) Andriy Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine will send at least 3 thousand recruits to Donbass.
According to him, in this way Kiev plans to &quot;at least somehow complete the units.&quot;
&quot;The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, mass layoffs have led to a low staffing of units,&quot; - said Marochko, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians drafted into the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later changed to the Joint Forces Operation (JF).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to an increase in the role of the Ukrainian security forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass worsened due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities qualified the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian special services.
US authorities forced Musk to leave the post of chairman of the board of Tesla
American businessman Elon Musk will leave the post of chairman of the board of directors of the Tesla company he founded at the request of the US authorities.
To settle the claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the entrepreneur will also pay $ 20 million.
According to CNBC, a pre-trial agreement with the department allows Musk to remain in a leading position at Tesla.
At the same time, he is obliged to pay $ 20 million and leave the position of the chairman of the board of directors within 45 days from the date of the agreement and for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed in his place.
It is clarified that the agreement still needs to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it became known that the US Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk of misleading shareholders by claiming that it had sufficient funds to buy back shares of this company and filed a lawsuit against the entrepreneur.
We are talking about the publication of a businessman on Twitter, where he announced his desire to buy back Tesla shares at $ 420 apiece, but he never did it.
Following the tweet, the company&#39;s shares are up nearly 11%.
British Foreign Minister compared EU to Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing the member states of the community.
This statement was made by the diplomat at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As the Daily Mail notes, in this way Hunt commented on the difficulties in the negotiation process on Brexit.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to defend freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, then the desire to leave it will not diminish, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity, &quot;the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to leave the European Union will only aggravate the crisis, Gazeta.ru notes.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that Brexit negotiations were at an impasse.
So she commented on the results of the informal summit of the European Union in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was made in 2016 following a referendum.
The UK withdrawal is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the question of the Irish border remains open.
President of South Korea who received mushrooms from the DPRK was presented with two dogs
South Korean President Moon Jae In received two puppies as a gift from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after his visit to Pyongyang.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to a representative of the South Korean presidential administration.
&quot;During the summit, a couple of phunsan dogs were offered as a gift.
They were received on Thursday, &quot;the ministry said.
For about a year, the North Korean side donated several kilograms of food to the dogs &quot;to help them adapt.&quot;
The gift was made in honor of the inter-Korean summit, which took place from September 18 to 20 in Pyongyang.
The phunsan hunting breed is from North Korean wolves and got its name from one of the districts of the DPRK.
As the agency notes, Moon loves animals, he already has two such dogs, which were presented to him by the former leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Il.
Dogs are not the only gift.
Also, Kim Jong-un gave his colleague two tons of delicious matsutake mushrooms.
He ordered to distribute these mushrooms to members of families separated during the Korean War, who have not yet reunited with their loved ones from the DPRK.
The head of the Altai village council ends a hunger strike in defense of the interests of residents
The MP said on his Facebook page that he stopped starving for several reasons.
The head of the village council said that the situation had reached an impasse, the district administration did not react to his demands, and he needed to do his job.
In addition, the prosecutor&#39;s office began to check the situation, and the heat supply organization STPK promised to start work on preparing the system for the winter heating season in the village of Sibirskiy next week.
Also, residents of the village council drew up and took away to the governor of the Altai Territory a massive collective appeal, &quot;concerning the current catastrophic situation.&quot;
Boronin himself said that he feels fine, that he fulfilled his duties as head during the hunger strike in full.
As Boronin explained, the settlements of Sibirskiy and Rogulichny have centralized heat supply systems, which means that the administration of the Pervomaisky district should exercise the authority to prepare them for winter.
However, until now, no one has started this work.
The head of the village council also protested against the lack of proper control and support from the government of the Altai Territory and against the financial policy of Gazprommezhregiongaz Novosibirsk.
In addition to the proper preparation of the settlements for the winter, Boronin demanded &quot;to immediately organize on the territory of the municipality a full-fledged independent communal sector with the appropriate staffing units.&quot;
New buildings in Moscow with the cheapest apartments named
In the first half of 2018, about three thousand housing units with an area of 30 square meters and a cost of up to four million rubles were bought in new buildings in Moscow.
More than half of such transactions fell on two residential complexes, according to materials from the Urbanus portal (available to Lenta.ru).
The leaders in terms of housing sales in the budget of up to four million rubles were the Nekrasovka residential complex, located outside the Moscow Ring Road, in the Kotelniki area (SEAD), and the Barberry apartment complex in the Bibirevo area (SVAO).
Noticeable in the structure of deals with budget housing were also two residential complexes in New Moscow - &quot;Yuzhnoye Bunino&quot; and &quot;Maple Alley&quot;.
Urbanus analysts note that the share of transactions with apartments up to four million rubles in these new buildings reaches 60 percent of all sales and provides half of the total revenue.
“It is necessary to recognize the influence of apartments with a budget of less than four million rubles on the commercial success of the Tsentralny microdistrict in Novye Vatutinki and the Filatov Lug residential complex,” the study says about two more New Moscow residential complexes.
At their expense, about 35 percent of the volume of financial receipts is formed.
Earlier, the rating of Moscow districts with the cheapest apartments in new buildings was presented in the Bon Ton real estate agency.
According to the company, the lowest prices for primary housing (149.9 thousand rubles per meter) in September 2018 were recorded in the SEAD.
The second and third places were taken by the Eastern Administrative District and the Northern Eastern Administrative District with indicators of 184.1 and 192.8 thousand rubles, respectively.

Telegram users complained about a crash in the new version
IPhone users have complained about problems in the Telegram messenger after the update, released on September 28.
The user&#39;s phone number can be found by his username
Complaints concern gadgets with the current operating system iOS 12.
According to their owners, after the update, the application shows a white screen or immediately closes.
Representatives of the messenger responded to the failure.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new application written in Swift.
Telegram has temporarily suspended automatic app updates pending troubleshooting.
On April 13, the Tagansky Court of Moscow satisfied the claim of Roskomnadzor to block the Telegram messenger in Russia.
Three days later, telecom operators began to implement the decision.
The reason was the refusal of the administration of the messenger to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence, which are necessary to obtain data on the terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a terrorist suspect user upon receipt of a court order.
Telegram audience after blocking in Russia decreased by 1.2 million

Elon Musk is forced to leave the post of the head of the board of directors of Tesla
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their fraud dispute.
It is reported by CNBC News.
According to the TV channel, as part of the agreements reached, Musk will have to leave the post of head of the Tesla board of directors.
At the same time, the commission allowed Musk to retain the post of head of Tesla.
As noted, the Tesla founder will also have to pay an administrative fine of $ 20 million.
Tesla will be charged the same amount.
In this case, the money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur, one of the 50 richest people in the world according to Forbes magazine.
He is the chief executive officer of space corporation SpaceX, the neurotech company Neuralink, and the developer of Tesla electric vehicles, as well as co-founder of Paypal.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission has previously sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his tweet about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to take Tesla into a private company and buy back all shares on the exchange for a fixed price of $ 420.
The share price at $ 420 was allegedly set &quot;because of the significance of this number in the culture of marijuana,&quot; Bloomberg previously reported, citing co-director of the Commission&#39;s security department Stephen Peikin.
At the same time, Elon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy back the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said that he considered the fraud charges unfounded, and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
&quot;Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I have not violated it in any way,&quot; the businessman told CNBC.
At the same time, in August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Musk, complaining about financial losses incurred.
The plaintiffs argued that the positions of the businessman brought them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that the businessman&#39;s tweets were misleading, because of which the sellers of Tesla shares were forced to buy securities at artificially inflated prices in order to cover their positions.
Also, other plaintiffs noted that Elon Musk&#39;s careless statements led to sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate.
In September, Elon Musk was also accused of stock fraud by the head of the research company Citron Research.
Meanwhile, if Musk could not resolve his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, he would face dismissal from the management of the company and even jail.
This, in particular, was announced to CNBC by the former chairman of the commission Harvey Pitt.
Musk is &quot;a nice guy who doesn&#39;t know how to run a car company.&quot;

The ROC compared the possible renaming of the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Department for External Church Relations (DECR) of the Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk, compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church into the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Nazis in Germany.
Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk - on the reasons for the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, a possible church schism and its political implications
According to him, now, when &quot;the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute stage,&quot; to rename the church is the same as in Nazi Germany &quot;to put on a yellow six-pointed star for the Jews.&quot;
&quot;This means labeling the church as an enemy organization, and it was for this purpose that this bill was created,&quot; said the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church on the air of the TV channel &quot;Russia 24&quot;.
The Metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, since &quot;the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country.&quot;
UOC called on exarchs of Constantinople to leave its territory
Grand Prix in Sochi: full house, Russian car and return of Kvyat
Over the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Kozak said this, summing up the results of the meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
Also, the Deputy Prime Minister shared his opinion on the return of Daniil Kvyat to Toro Rosso and assessed the attendance of the Russian stage of Formula 1.
In the foreseeable future, the result of our meeting with automakers should be the creation of a Russian Formula 1 car, which has no analogues in the world, ”said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to stimulate our carmakers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I don’t think it’s possible in such a timeframe.
I think a more realistic time frame is within the next ten years. &quot;
From 2012 to 2014, the Marusya team played in Formula 1 under a Russian license.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there are already investors willing to invest in the creation of a national team in the Formula 1 World Championship.
I know that in Russia there are motor sports enthusiasts, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula 1 team, ”he said.
&quot;We are ready to support them morally.
Let&#39;s hope that we will have such a team.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team appeared also because such an infrastructure appeared in Sochi. &quot;
Tomorrow Sochi Autodrom will be sold out.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50 thousand tickets.
Look, even at the qualifications, the stands were almost full, - said the Deputy Prime Minister.
I can say that this year&#39;s revenue has grown by 72% compared to last year.
This is a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the efficiency of using the Sochi Autodrom infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitry Kozak did not bypass the main theme of the day for Russian motorsport fans - the return of Daniil Kvyat to Toro Rosso.
We all together congratulate Daniel and wish him success in the next season, ”the Deputy Prime Minister told Izvestia.
He is a promising racer.
Next year, for the first time in history, two main Russian pilots will be able to take part in the Formula 1 peloton at once.
Although the further fate of Sergei Sirotkin in the &quot;Royal Race&quot; is still unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not yet impressive: he finished 18th in the qualifying for the Russian Grand Prix.
Let&#39;s hope that next season there will be more of our main pilots than this year, - said Dmitry Kozak.

On September 30, 1928, that is, exactly 90 years ago, the British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming worldwide fame and made him a Nobel laureate.
By the way, the isolation of penicillin from molds was not Fleming&#39;s first discovery.
A few years earlier, being with a cold, he sowed mucus from his own nose on a Petri dish (this is a glass lid in which experiments with bacteria are carried out) and a few days later found that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
In almost the same way, he discovered penicillin by chance.
Fleming&#39;s name was included in the list of the 100 most prominent personalities in the history of mankind.
Its discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the oldest diseases that were previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene ...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, Parisian newspapers wrote: &quot;He did more than dozens of divisions to defeat fascism and liberate France.&quot;
According to experts, Fleming&#39;s discovery of the world&#39;s first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in London&#39;s famous St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral.
Where, by the way, my wife and I paid attention to this talkative Russian-speaking guide.
And a few years later, we had a chance to observe the full-length statue of Alexander Fleming in the most unexpected place for this in the capital of Spain.
There, next to the main bullfighting arena Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the most famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to the man, whose efforts, in their opinion, saved the lives of hundreds of outstanding bullfighting masters.
By the way, this, in my opinion, very interesting porcelain work was found by me in the same place, in Madrid, but at a different time and not at all for this reason.

The American leader denied information that he had abandoned the issue of exporting the remains of American soldiers from the DPRK and the release of prisoners.
“I didn’t give up anything,” the president stressed.

Trump talks about &quot;falling in love&quot; with Kim Jong-un
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and the DPRK almost reached the point of falling in love with each other, Donald Trump joked.
US President Donald Trump made a good joke about his successes in the settlement of the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have straightened their relations so much that they are almost in love with each other, the American president said.
The owner of the White House recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama&#39;s team had so launched relations with the DPRK that they could not even get through to the country&#39;s leadership - they simply did not pick up the phone there.
Then the United States and the DPRK were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing &quot;wonderful letters&quot; to the White House, Trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work he was also &quot;cruel&quot; to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
However, now their relationship has straightened out so much that the leaders &quot;fell in love with each other.&quot;
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the fact that recently Pyongyang has stopped nuclear and missile tests, and is also closing military training grounds.
All this is the merit of the work of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump spoke flatteringly about Kim Jong-un from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the moment of the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Talks in Singapore
On June 12, the first ever talks between the leaders of the United States and North Korea took place in Singapore.
After a serious aggravation of relations and mutual threats of the use of nuclear weapons, the summit looked like a turning point in the protracted US-Korean crisis.
As a result of the talks, the parties expressed their intention to move towards a peaceful resolution of the contradictions, although they did not undertake any legal obligations.
The positive results of the meeting were the termination of nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers who were in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still stalled.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the United States had already sent several scenarios for disarmament to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them &quot;gangster&quot;.

Nitsoy called for replacing the &quot;Moscow language with a Ukrainian product&quot;
Larisa Nitsoy, a Ukrainian children&#39;s writer and fighter for the purity of her native language, called for the &quot;Russian-speaking Moscow product and the Moscow language&quot; to be forced out of Ukraine.
She proposes to do this with a Ukrainian product - &quot;a cultural wave, a cultural onslaught.&quot;
Nitsoy shared her thoughts on the &quot;expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine&quot; with the Ukrainian edition &quot;Observer&quot;.
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it even already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will &quot;recover&quot; from this &quot;Moscow language&quot;, she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, Russian speech was widely used on television and radio before, but it practically disappeared in the public space.
At the same time, according to Nitsoy, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only &quot;expanding the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level.&quot;
Previously, Nitsoy shared her experience of maintaining the &quot;Ukrainian-language regime&quot; in a children&#39;s camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to sue the Watsons bookstore chain, the cashier of one of which spoke to her in Russian.
Not having achieved her goal, Nitsoy threw change at the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians &quot;linguistic schizophrenia&quot;, urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the spelling of surnames.
Recently Nitsoy stated that the name &quot;Rus&quot; was stolen from the Ukrainians, so that Russia should be called Muscovy.
Even the Security Service of Ukraine could not avoid the writer&#39;s anger: when she came there and heard the conversations of the employees with each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, slamming the door.
During the break, we had a male conversation, and it paid off.
Ural defender Denis Kulakov on the victory over Arsenal (2: 1) in the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship.
&quot;Denis, due to what, in your opinion, did you manage to win?&quot;
“It seems to me that we wanted to win more,” the official website of “Ural” quotes Kulakov as saying.
“Such a difficult game turned out, during the break we had a serious male conversation, and it paid off: we scored two goals and did not concede.
“You missed a few matches because of the damage you received at the beginning of the month.
How did you feel today? &quot;
&quot;If you survived 90 minutes, then everything is fine!
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe at the end, a little bit of power, so that nothing happens.
And so, doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev brought me to this game, for which many thanks to them!
&quot;What do you think about the atmosphere in the team?&quot;
&quot;It is no secret to anyone that after victories it is easier to recover, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white stripe, although at first it was black.
We need to continue in the same spirit and delight the fans. &quot;
&quot;Did you miss the game while not playing?&quot;
&quot;There is such a thing, I missed it a little, because really, an unpleasant situation has emerged.
But I repeat once again, thanks to the physiotherapist and doctors for getting me on my feet.
The most important thing is that we won and made the fans happy.
And the rest is all secondary. &quot;

Violations recorded at referendum in Macedonia
Four incidents related to violations of electoral legislation were registered in the Republic of Macedonia at a referendum on an intergovernmental agreement with Greece on renaming.
This was announced on Sunday by the spokesman for the Ministry of Internal Affairs Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of polling stations, 4 incidents have been recorded, which have been eliminated, he said.
At the polling station at the Lazo Angelovski elementary school in Skopje, 22-year-old K.Zh. violated public order and peace, insulted citizens and attacked police officers.
He was detained and taken to the police station.
According to the Foreign Ministry spokesman, all violators were immediately taken to police stations.
The ministry noted that all violations are being checked.
“The ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can safely exercise the constitutional right to freely express their will.
We urge citizens to abide by the laws and refrain from any violations of public order and peace and any violation of the secrecy of the vote, &quot;the Interior Ministry spokesman said.
Citizens in the referendum on Sunday are asked to answer one question: &quot;Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?&quot;
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17, during a ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, along which the border between the two countries passes, signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic.
It provides for the use of the name &quot;Republic of North Macedonia&quot;.
This agreement should resolve not only the long-term dispute over the name of the country, but also open the way for Skopje to NATO and the EU.
Syrian Foreign Minister: Russia&#39;s decision to supply S-300 is a timely step
Russia&#39;s decision to supply S-300 surface-to-air missile systems (SAM) to Syria is a timely step.
This opinion was expressed by the head of the Syrian Foreign Ministry Walid Muallem in an interview with RT, which aired on Sunday.
If we analyze the importance of protecting the Syrian sky, we will see that this is a sign of security and stability, not war.
I want to say that this is a very timely step, and we are very grateful in this regard to Russia for its efforts, &quot;the minister said.
The Syrian Foreign Minister also stressed that the S-300 is a defensive, not an offensive system, and it is designed to protect the Syrian sky.
Pashinyan hopes to hold early parliamentary elections in Armenia in 2018
Elections to the Armenian parliament may take place as early as 2018, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said.
&quot;It is possible that by the end of the year,&quot; the head of government replied to a question from journalists about the timing of their holding (quoted by Interfax).
Mr. Pashinyan also did not rule out that he would &quot;again bring people to the streets&quot; to hold early elections, if the discussion of this issue with the parliamentary forces is not crowned with success.
But I am determined to negotiate with parliamentary forces.
I hope that they, too, are disposed for a constructive dialogue, &quot;Novosti-Armenia quotes the prime minister.
Nikol Pashinyan added that early elections are &quot;the demand of the people&quot; and also part of the government&#39;s program, which the parliament voted for.
A &quot;long-term vision of the government,&quot; he said, is also needed to attract investment and develop the economy.
At the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Pashinyan promised, after returning to Yerevan, to begin &quot;negotiations with representatives of all parliamentary and extra-parliamentary forces to discuss the time and conditions for early elections.&quot;
In the current parliament, about half of the deputies represent the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA), which is in opposition to Mr. Pashinyan.
Early voting is impossible without the dissolution of parliament, and there are no legal grounds for this yet.

The accusation for the Dagestani deputy became news
The Sovetsky District Court of Makhachkala imprisoned for two months a deputy of the People&#39;s Assembly of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, who was suspected of participating in a criminal community that formalized disability in exchange for bribes.
Kommersant learned the details of the investigation materials, shedding light on how exactly, according to the Russian Investigative Committee, the younger brother of the former head of the republic, Ramazan Abdulatipov, Rajab Abdulatipov, contributed to the criminal actions of the now former head of the Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices ...
Among other things, during the operational-search activities carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was established that Rajab Abdulatipov lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev as head of the bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million rubles for this.
We will remind that earlier the investigation against Magomed Makhachev, other heads and employees of the territorial bureaus of medical and social expertise, which are in his subordination, initiated a criminal case under Art. 210 (creation of a criminal community with the use of official position and participation in it), art. 290 (taking a bribe by an organized group), Art. 292 (official forgery) and Art. 159 (fraud on an especially large scale) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
As follows from the materials of the investigation, at the end of 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, knowing about the illegal actions of Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices, who were involved in the theft of funds from the Pension Fund, joined their activities by joining a criminal community.
Being the head of the department of the Federal Migration Service of Russia for Dagestan and having connections in state authorities and law enforcement structures, as well as using his family relationship with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, the investigators believe, “ensured the activities of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with officials persons of state bodies to support the illegal activities of Magomed Makhachev and his appointment as head of the federal government institution &quot;Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise in the Republic of Dagestan&quot;, organized the illegal establishment of disabilities for citizens. &quot;
After the announcement of this information at a meeting of the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov denied the charges against him.
&quot;Of course, everything that is being brought against me today is new for me, I am absolutely not familiar with this,&quot; he said.
The court arrested the United Russia deputy not for ten days before being charged, as was the case with the previous high-ranking Dagestani officials, but for two months at once, since his case includes Art. 210 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
According to the Criminal Procedure Code, the investigation has much more time to bring charges - up to 45 days from the moment of arrest.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia in a negative vein was practically absent
Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the Federation Council committee on international affairs, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it may become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global world problems.
&quot;The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my opinion, lies in the fact that the rhetoric to which we have almost gotten used to in recent years in relation to Russia, was now much more muted,&quot; the senator said in an interview published on Sunday. Russian newspaper &quot;.
He explained that in previous years the Russian Federation was sometimes &quot;designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, either along with Ebola, or along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, at least in the presentation of a group of Western countries, which expressed itself quite unanimously on this score. &quot;
At the 73rd session, Kosachev emphasized, &quot;the topic of Russia was practically absent in a negative vein.&quot;
&quot;If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, now I am not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the chorus was not quite accurate,&quot; the politician noted, noting that Russia &quot;is more was not some kind of wall about which tennis balls are trained. &quot;
The head of the specialized committee of the Federation Council does not exclude that this indicates a certain tendency, which, in his opinion, &quot;will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this tendency may fully manifest itself in a year, two or three years.&quot;
&quot;I do not exclude that the current session in some sense may be a turning point,&quot; Kosachev admitted, explaining that &quot;there are too many examples of how, with the involvement of Russia, it is possible to move forward in international affairs.&quot;
As an example, he cited the situations in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
&quot;So far, unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time,&quot; the parliamentarian added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is &quot;an adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in solving global problems of our time.&quot;
&quot;I would not like to be mistaken, but I have a feeling that we are passing a point somewhere beyond which the movement will no longer be a movement backward, it will be a movement forward,&quot; he added.
Another &quot;interesting and important sensation&quot; in this context, Kosachev called &quot;the request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop.&quot;
“I attended so many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly], Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I saw with great pleasure that if a year or two or five years ago, Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in By and large, no one was interested in the world, but now the situation is different, &quot;said the chairman of the Federation Council committee.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that &quot;the so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, does not have answers to the questions of how to solve world problems due to an obvious shortage of ideas in the global space, a shortage of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East. East, problems of terrorism, problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, problems of migration. &quot;
&quot;And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious,&quot; Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that in this sense he considers &quot;the current session to be successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia.&quot;

Vakhtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists talk about how they managed to cope with cancer.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, and the stories of popular people about victories over cancer give hope to many patients.
The famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he is alive only thanks to his wife.
Many years ago he was given a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
&quot;It was as if I was hit on the skull with a hammer.
I fell.
Lost orientation.
They were admitted to the hospital.
I could not hold a spoon there, I could not stand, I fell all the time.
We began to do tests, it turned out that things were bad, the artery does not allow blood to pass through.
They brought me to Moscow, they said that I had a large purulent cyst in my head, they urgently underwent an operation.
And during the operation, the doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst, &quot;- said Kikabidze in the program&quot; Once &quot;.
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, residents of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol on the threshold of his house.
But the actor&#39;s wife did not allow the burial of a living actor, she firmly believed that she could cope with the disease and did not leave the bed of her beloved spouse for more than a year.

And from time to time he refutes rumors about his illness, then about an untimely death, which now and then appear on the Web.
The creators of the site &quot;Peacemaker&quot; added the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary Peter Siyjarto to the &quot;Purgatory&quot; section.
The reason was &quot;an attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.&quot;
In addition, the foreign minister of the neighboring country was accused of &quot;direct threats to invade Ukraine&quot; and &quot;support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine&quot;, as well as participation &quot;in organizing a provocation aimed at massive violation of Ukrainian legislation by Ukrainian citizens.&quot;
It should be noted that the governor of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Pavel and the primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) Onufriy fell into the &quot;Purgatory&quot; before Siyarto.
The reason was their opposition to the receipt of the Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.

Thus, the press service emphasized, the size of the lump sum, net of income tax, was 223,892 rubles, and not 1 million rubles, which the media wrote about.
The official has received an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
His experience in public office is over nine years.
The appointment of this pension and a lump sum payment to him is made immediately after his dismissal, the regional government explained to RIA Novosti.

Alexandra Gusev, who won the governor&#39;s elections, took office on 15 September.
Agibalov was dismissed from office due to the expiration of the term of office of the acting head of the region.

State Duma deputy urged to tell schoolchildren about the dangers of masturbation
Onishchenko is the first deputy chairman of the Education and Science Committee.
Based on his work experience, he noted in an interview that adolescents to masturbate are provoked by harmful information that they find on the Internet.
It is worth fighting this at the level of educational institutions and families, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station &quot;Moscow speaking&quot;:
As part of the general sex education of children, this should be done, explaining the harm, because there is a certain risk to the sexual health of the child, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it consists in the fact that the maturation of children occurs early enough, and then large scissors appear between their puberty and the opportunity to officially enter into intergenderal contacts.
According to Onishchenko, the solution of the problem is hampered by &quot;hypocrisy&quot;, the suppression of &quot;sexual age problems&quot; and the lack of a culture of adequate upbringing of children.
The doctor is sure that many adolescents face masturbation.
The deputy believes that the practice of lessons about the dangers of masturbation is primarily in the schools of &quot;hyper-urbanized&quot; regions.
&quot;If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, they just won&#39;t understand us, to put it mildly,&quot; the professor said.
Gennady Onishchenko - acting Academician of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, member of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Professor.
Honored Doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the Presidium of the All-Russian public organization &quot;League of the Health of the Nation&quot;.

AfD has become the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany is breaking another record in popularity, and Angela Merkel&#39;s ratings are falling.
Apparently, the people of Germany have begun to get seriously tired of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, thanks to which the country has become a coveted target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most obvious evidence of this is the latest opinion polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party &quot;Alternative for Germany&quot; is becoming more and more popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc of Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
The AfD broke another record this week, moving up to second place in the popular sympathy rating.
The right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent of their popularity, have managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The one percentage point gap can be attributed to a statistical error, but at the same time, it should be noted that the AfD, created in 2013, from a small group of Eurosceptic economists has managed to turn into a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings is still held by the ruling bloc of the CSU / CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency for points to be lost - back in April, support for the Angela Merkel bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth term in a row, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent less than last year.
We add that the Social Democrats are followed by the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
Evolution of &quot;Alternatives&quot;
The party &quot;Alternative for Germany&quot; was created in September 2012 on the basis of the group &quot;Alternative choice 2013&quot;, which included immigrants from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially stood in opposition to the government&#39;s course, but at first it was engaged only in economic issues, including the problems of the euro and interaction within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed the &quot;sponsoring&quot; of the weak EU economies by Germany, did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German mark and the country&#39;s complete withdrawal from the European Union.
Against the background of the deepening immigration crisis, the AfD&#39;s political platform expanded.
In 2013, the group formed into a full-fledged party, which occupied the niche of Eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, AfD managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, having received 94 parliamentary seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the &quot;Alternative for Germany&quot; get seats in the European Parliament.
A video was published with a journalist who called the citizens of Ukraine &quot;a nation of boobies&quot;
The host of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, author of two books, Ostap Drozdov, admitted on air that he considers his compatriots a &quot;nation of boobies.&quot;
They believe in television and read little.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
&quot;Since childhood, we have not been taught a culture of reading and accepting texts,&quot; the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov&#39;s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting of Nezalezhnaya began to fight against literature in which there is the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of 201 editions.

Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defense Solutions said it is already accepting applications for its new armored car.
Roshel Senator APC apocalypse armored car
It&#39;s not just video game makers, film studios and book publishers who make money on the topic of the apocalypse.
Now automobile companies are also exploring a new niche for themselves.
So, the Canadian Roshel Defense Solutions presented its Senator APC apocalypse armored car.
In their free time, the engineers of this company create armored vehicles for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who, without much comfort, but in complete safety, are housed in an all-welded armored capsule.
This bunker, otherwise you cannot name the design, since the level of its booking corresponds to the B7 standard, is installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armored, is capable of protecting the capsule from being exploded by grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Salon of the armored car of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
To prevent passengers from being harmed even by a blast wave from a shell that exploded next to the car, the car&#39;s interior is equipped with special shock-absorbing seats.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire extinguishing system.
For a safe view, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a night vision all-round camera system and an armored observation tower on the roof.
There is no weapon in the car.

So that the heaviness of the armored vehicle does not affect its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-horsepower 6.7-liter turbodiesel engine, all the power of which is transmitted to the four wheels of the armored car through a 6-speed automatic transmission.
Roshel Senator APC apocalypse armored car has no chance of getting stuck completely
You can see the Roshel Senator APC apocalypse armored car at a specialized exhibition in Washington, which will be held in October.
The deadline for the death of the universe
The universe will survive for another 140 billion years, which is ten times the age of the observable world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The research by an international team of scientists has been uploaded to the arXiv.org electronic preprint library and is sent for publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts came to similar conclusions by observing about ten million galaxies using the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) telescope of the Subaru telescope.
By tracing the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Dark Matter), estimated the expansion rate of the universe, which turned out to be slightly slower than previously thought.
In a press release, the Subaru Observatory notes that the observations made it possible to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the accounting of data from the European Space Telescope Planck clarified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of ΛCDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Rip.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to find out the opinion of the people about the pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the federal initiative group for a referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups who registered different wordings of questions (in total, the CEC registered five wordings).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a petition to register a single initiative group and ask the Russians a question: &quot;You are in favor of the age established by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, upon reaching which Russian citizens are entitled to receive an old-age pension. didn&#39;t go up? &quot;
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was precisely it that was considered the simplest and most legally capacious.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of a member of &quot;Fair Russia&quot; Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their consent to come.
But, for example, Marina Semyonova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (her wording was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she had not received an invitation and did not plan to come: “We did not understand who is friend and who is enemy.”

In the match &quot;Loko&quot; - &quot;Akhmat&quot; Turbin&#39;s mistakes poured, as if from a cornucopia
Former referee of the all-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship &quot;Lokomotiv&quot; - &quot;Akhmat&quot; and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the refereeing of Evgeny Turbin in the match “Lokomotiv” - “Akhmat”?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his inability to referee matches of the Russian Premier League.
It amazes me that the pressure in the fifth round meeting “Spartak” - “Dynamo”, neither Turbin himself, nor the leaders of the DSI did not make serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result was not slow to show itself in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, partial omissions of rough tricks poured in as if from a cornucopia.
For example, in the 50th minute of the railroad worker Eder is overwhelmed with the help of his hands in his penalty area by the defender of “Akhmat” Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the goal, but Turbin does not give a penalty.
- How do you assess the episode with the participation of Idov, which was in the 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball had hit his hand?
- I believe that there was a deliberate play by the defender&#39;s hand in his own penalty area.
Turbin was close to the moment, he clearly sees this episode and his first assistant on the right.
The reserve referee Sergei Karasev should have seen this moment as well.
However, all three overslept and no penalty was awarded.
Therefore, the score in the match was distorted, and sports justice was violated.
This was the case when concept refereeing supplanted and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- At the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dare to remove the guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight against Krykhovyak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card, demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Was it necessary to show the second &quot;yellow card&quot;?
- At this moment Turbin showed the first yellow card not quite to the point.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of refereeing that some teams are given a penalty for such violations as in the episode with Idov, and some are not.
What do you rate the words of a football player?
- It depends on what is meant by double standards.
There was a penalty kick.
He was not given.
This means that the referee does not give a second penalty to the opposite goal.
Here is the principle used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee watches who plays.
Lokomotiv played on Saturday and Akhmat had serious complaints about Turbin&#39;s work, because the team was disadvantaged.
Matt Damon played rape charged Judge Cavanaugh at SNL start
American actor Matt Damon played the US Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of NBC&#39;s Saturday Night Live.
In a short sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The US Supreme Court nominee previously attracted attention for his emotionality and detail in his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
So, Cavanaugh has repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but stated that he never got drunk to unconsciousness.
In addition, in an attempt to exonerate himself on charges of rape, Cavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin during those years.
These moments were also beaten by Damon.
All I did was drink a lot and didn&#39;t think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunk virgin that anyone has ever seen.
Everyone knows this, &quot;said the judge, played by Matt Damon.
Earlier, Cavanaugh was elected Chief Justice of the United States.
Barbra Streisand discovered strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbra Streisand stated that the clones of her deceased dog behave completely differently from the original pet.
&quot;They&#39;re not alike.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it&#39;s impossible to clone a soul, &quot;said the 76-year-old singer.
In late 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old Coton de Tulear dog named Samantha, who had to be euthanized due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, which was named the smallest dog in the world, was cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States is thinking about the naval blockade of Russia due to oil and gas supplies
The United States may launch a naval blockade of Russia in order to gain an advantage in the world energy market.
The American authorities are so zealous in the fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world&#39;s main energy suppliers.
US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke spoke about the possibility of a naval blockade yesterday.
Contrary to world practice, the US Department of the Interior performs not police, but civilian functions, including implementing a policy in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke&#39;s statement came out completely within the competence of the department headed by him, although it was not devoid of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the US naval forces, the United States controls the sea routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
From Zinke&#39;s words, it followed that the need may be related to Washington&#39;s desire to interfere with Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion&#39;s share of its revenues from oil and gas supplies to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow&#39;s activation in this region, Zinke is sure.
The minister made it clear that the United States still hopes to secure leadership in the global energy market by becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to squeeze Russia and Iran, and a naval blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure along this path, Zinke said.

Supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will be put into serial production
Serial production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was stated by the Director General of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute named after Zhukovsky Kirill Sypalo.
According to him, the research center is working on supersonic topics both within the framework of international consortia and in cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
“According to our feelings, it will take us two to three years to get a demonstrator of technologies, as well as another 10-15 years to get a serial machine that will allow us to transport across the vastness of our homeland,” added Sypalo.
He clarified that now Russian specialists are faced with the question of how to make equipment economical and safe at the same time.
In early September, the developer of aviation technology PJSC Tupolev announced the completion of pre-design work on a supersonic passenger aircraft, according to calculations, the aircraft will be able to reach speeds of up to 1900 km / h at an altitude of 11 km.
This was announced by the deputy general director of the enterprise Valery Solozobov.

He stated this on the air of CNN.
He said that he could only confirm the words of the Washington Post columnist that the result of Putin&#39;s aggression against Ukraine was the unification of Ukrainians.
“In 2013, the transatlantic integration of Ukraine, NATO membership was supported by 16% of Ukrainians.
Now it is more than 54%.
Who did it?
Putin.
In 2013, the European integration of Ukraine, accession to the EU was supported by 33% of Ukrainians.
Now 74%.
Who did this?
Putin, &quot;Poroshenko said.
So thank you, Mr Putin, for making my country much more European and much more ready to defend European values and transatlantic values.
And we are absolutely sure that we will not return to the Russian Empire, &quot;the President of Ukraine stressed.
As &quot;FACTS&quot; wrote, at the end of September 2018, President Petro Poroshenko was in the United States and took part in the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly.

A club has appeared in Russia, which I follow
Former Chelsea and England captain John Terry - on why he attended the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship &quot;Spartak&quot; - &quot;Rostov&quot; (0: 1).
“In Russia, I have a club that I follow.
I have been watching quite recently and it was interesting for me to look at it from the outside.
I cannot say that I am a fan, since my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartak and once again I want to apologize for the decision, &quot;the Chelsea fan site quotes Terry as saying.
We will remind, “Rostov” with 18 points rose to third place in the standings, and “Spartak” is located on the fifth line, having 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, the red and white on October 7 will play on the road with “Yenisei”, and Valery Karpin&#39;s charges will receive “Orenburg” a day earlier.
An expensive violin was handed over to a pawnshop for a pittance
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, a pawnshop worker offered only $ 50 for the looking old and unpresentable instrument.
But experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that it was an old and expensive instrument and turned to an expert for advice.
It was then that it became clear that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin maker Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250 thousand dollars.
The bows to the violin alone are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was recently stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was returned to its rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the person who handed it over to the pawnshop, but he does not have any previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now everyone who brings the violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, an exciting confrontation awaits us: “Spartak” will host “Rostov” at its stadium in Tushino under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a man, as you know, is not at all a stranger to the “people&#39;s team”.
The special piquancy of this meeting is given by the fact that the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15 each, and they share the 3rd and 4th places in the standings, lagging behind the far galloping Zenit and being one point from Krasnodar, which will play tomorrow &quot;Dynamo&quot;.
The red-whites have a difficult streak now: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League Massimo Carrera&#39;s team unexpectedly flew into Rapid, and recently lost at home to Akhmat.
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, Spartak beat Chornomorets in the Cup with a minimum score and not without difficulty, and it is too early to say whether the most popular club in Russia is close to overcoming the crisis.
“Rostov” three matches in a row could not win, but has not known defeats for five matches.
Let&#39;s see if Karpin will be able to extend the unbeaten run with such a principled match for himself.
The previous meeting of Karpinsky “Rostov” with “Spartak” ended in favor of the capital team.
The beginning is at 19:00.
Indonesia is shaken by aftershocks after a powerful tsunami
In Indonesia, where an earthquake happened a few days ago, which provoked a three-meter tsunami, meteorologists are observing more than 170 aftershocks.
The magnitude was 7.4, mainly affecting the island of Sulawesi, according to the TV channel &quot;Russia 24&quot;.
The death toll exceeded 420 people, and more than five hundred were injured.
The authorities warned the population about the tsunami threat in advance, but later canceled it.
The fact is that the instruments did not register the approach of the wave.
The fate of dozens of residents who were preparing to celebrate the national holiday on one of the embankments of the city of Palu, which was most destroyed after the disaster, is still unknown.
London erupted in accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the Cold War, said British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at the ruling Conservative Party convention in Birmingham.
There are more and more threats, Iran and North Korea are more and more dangerous, enemies operate in gray zones with the help of cyberattacks and false news, the minister added.
But the biggest of them is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Moscow has repeatedly denied such statements by Western politicians, TASS reports.
At the same time, British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March this year of ex-GRU colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of espionage for Great Britain, and his daughter Yulia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the country&#39;s name.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year-old dispute with neighboring Greece over the country&#39;s name, which coincides with the name of the neighboring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, an ardent supporter of the republic&#39;s renaming into North Macedonia.
International organizations are watching the preparations for the referendum and today&#39;s voting.
The head of the observation mission of the Bureau for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers is organized:
Approximately 100 teams have traveled across the country to observe the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to their closing, then the counting of votes and the drawing up of minutes.
For a month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, which monitored the preparations for the vote, the work of the media, the observance of the law on financing election campaigns and the organization of the referendum.
Faye Dulgeri: &quot;About 500 foreign observers are closely monitoring the voting process.
Observer groups record in detail what is happening and communicate with members of the election commissions, in order to then present them in the final report. &quot;
The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding.
Professional interpreter-simultaneous interpreter Berbel Saxe told about this on the International Day of the Interpreter, September 30.
She has been translating from Russian and English for over 30 years.
“The Germans like to plan events calmly, while the Russians, as the proverb says,“ harness for a long time, but they go fast ”.
But it seems to me that this does not play a significant role for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of a translator, &quot;the specialist said in a comment to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries cannot do without each other, &quot;it is enough to know history.&quot;
And in the future, Sachse noted, it makes no sense for Germany to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny, &quot;she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country is trying to &quot;establish relations&quot; with Russia and maintain them.
According to her, the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is being built from the Russian coast to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is especially important for the Berlin mania.

Comedy &quot;Night School&quot; tops the American box office
The Comedy Night School, which debuted in American theaters last Friday, grossed $ 28 million in its first weekend at the box office.
This result allowed an uncomplicated picture starring Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to head the US box office for September 28-30.
On the international market, the film, which has so far been released in only 20 countries, has grossed $ 5.5 million, including 2 million from UK audiences.
In the struggle for the first line, Malcolm Lee&#39;s creation, which is remarkable, quite noticeably outstripped another newcomer to the western distribution - the cartoon &quot;Smallfoot&quot;, an interesting story of the acquaintance of a charming yeti with a representative of the human race, in whose existence the protagonist never believed.
The project by directors Carey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig raised $ 23 million over its opening weekend, generally meeting the expectations of experts who predicted 20-25 million for the tape over the weekend.
As for the total fees of &quot;Smallfoot&quot;, at the moment they amount to $ 38.6 million (while he made his debut in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active here, replenishing the film&#39;s coffers by 3.6 million.
The top three this time was closed by the children&#39;s fairy tale &quot;The Mystery of the House with a Clock&quot; from the master of horrors Eli Roth, which finally proved that the director can make high-quality films for an audience of 12+.
In its second week at the box office, the film adaptation of John Bellairs&#39; book with the charming Jack Black with Cate Blanchett earned $ 12.5 million, bringing the total worldwide gross to 53.8 million.
Despite the departure from the top 3, the thriller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick &quot;A Simple Request&quot; continues to amaze with the &quot;+&quot; sign: for 17 days in the American box office, the picture of Paul Fig, from which some unrealistic financial accomplishments were not initially expected from the word &quot;quite&quot;, has collected $ 43 million (including 6.6 million for October 28-30) and right now has as much as 62.9 million in total revenue.
The last member of the top five this week was the horror &quot;The Curse of the Nun&quot;, which raised $ 5.4 million during the reporting period.
Spin-off &quot;The Conjuring&quot; on the basis of 24 days in American (and not only, of course) cinemas has $ 330 million in total earnings on its account and has recently proudly bears the title of the most successful film in the franchise, which also includes two parts of The Conjuring itself. and two tapes about the creepy doll Annabelle.
Right after the horror film by Corinne Hardy at the end of the past weekend, another representative of the genre is located - the debutant &quot;Hellfest&quot;, one of the main youth horror films of the year.
On its first weekend, the brainchild of renowned editor (and more recently director) Gregory Plotkin, who has previously worked on a number of big horror projects, including Happy Death Day, to which Hellfest is very similar in places, made $ 5.1 million in the United States.
Considering the film&#39;s modest budget, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh was &quot;Crazy Rich Asians&quot; ($ 4.15 million), which, it seems, do not even think of dropping out of the top 10 of the American box office: a romantic comedy that has been on the screens for the seventh week, at the end of September it is the sixth in the ranking of the highest grossing tapes of the genre throughout history with an indicator of 165.7 million.
This is the amount that the picture has currently earned in the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.
As for the last three lucky ones, who got into the top ten in the USA for September 28-30, they were &quot;Predator&quot;, &quot;White guy Rick&quot; and ... &quot;Crimson Mint&quot;, who earned $ 3.7 million over the past weekend, respectively, 2.38 million and 1.1 million
We add that next weekend in the United States will be in full swing collecting the long-awaited &quot;Venom&quot; with Tom Hardy, who - there is no doubt about it - without any problems will take over the leadership in the American box office at the end of the first weekend in October.
Among other premieres of the coming week, it is worth highlighting the musical-melodrama &quot;A Star is Born&quot;, winner of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the crime drama &quot;Your Hate&quot;.

Valery Belov: The Lord helped Siberia today
Vityaz head coach Valery Belov talks about the defeat to Siberia (3: 4) in the KHL regular championship match.
“A colleague talked about the fans of“ Siberia ”, and I want to mention our fans,” the official website of “Vityaz” quotes Belov as saying.
“I hope they will also support, because now almost every game is full of a stadium, great atmosphere.
In terms of the game, the Lord probably helped Siberia today, because they were very grossly mistaken, especially our leaders.
In general, our leading leaders lost the micro - match 0: 3, so it was difficult for us to pull out this match, although there were chances.
But, nevertheless, I will still take the blame.
Because, apparently, they missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was a different team. &quot;
&quot;This is an ugly nepotism&quot;
Viewers are outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show &quot;Voice&quot;
Spectators of the show &quot;Voice 60+&quot; accuse their mentor Leonid Agutin of &quot;ugly nepotism and impudent manipulation.&quot;
When in blind auditions, from the first notes, he recognized the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin, many hoped that he would remain neutral and would not turn to the performer.
But filial feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative to his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor for the bias at the first stage.
But the &quot;joke&quot; dragged on, and the star&#39;s father absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday we, the spectators of the show, were outraged by the nepotism, the ugly and openly dragging our close relatives onto the final staircase.
I even doubted that Agutin would have the strength and conscience not to drag his dad to the very end to the first place, &quot;argued Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the&quot; Man from TV &quot;program.
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin &quot;leaked&quot; wonderful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience would continue to want to see his father in the show.
But, as it turned out, this is not at all the case, the viewers want an objective assessment and see really talented performers in the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
&quot;I sympathize with the members of the&quot; Voice &quot;from Agutin&#39;s team - they were doomed.&quot;
&quot;Last time Agutin showed how much he loves his dad, and today he had to show himself as a professional.&quot;
&quot;The competition has lost its meaning.&quot;
&quot;Remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project his dad who does not sing but whispers, how can you name a mentor after that?&quot;
&quot;I like how dad sings, organize a concert for him in the Kremlin for your own money and see how many people will come to this concert.&quot;
This is the &quot;Voice&quot; show, not the &quot;Cool Relatives&quot; show.
&quot;It was unprofessional from Agutin&#39;s side.&quot;
&quot;Then you have to offer your dad to speak on your own show, and not on a show that is being made for the money of Channel 1.&quot;
&quot;It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone else&#39;s place.
And I don&#39;t understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other member with real vocal abilities.
Why was a worker from Surgut with a great voice and timbre merged, and Agutin&#39;s dad was brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on stage and on screens the same faces for decades!
Because you can&#39;t break through nepotism! &quot;
&quot;What were you waiting for?
Well this is Russia!
All around is cronyism and nepotism.
And money for the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theater of the absurd continues! &quot;
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional &quot;Voice&quot;, the son of Gradsky came out on blind auditions.
Then it never occurred to the meter to take his son into his own team.
Moreover, he said: &quot;Come on, get out of here, everything is clear.&quot;
Agutin could not act like a professional.

Russia will begin to fine for violations in the field of shared construction
From tomorrow, Russia will begin to fine for violations in the field of shared construction, reports the channel &quot;Russia 24&quot;.
Companies and officials will be punished if they do not transfer data on the building being built to the Unified Housing Construction Information System in time.
The innovation will be of great help for those who decided to buy an apartment in a new building, but are afraid of the developer&#39;s bankruptcy.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for representatives of the construction industry.
Due to amendments to the law on shared construction, developers will have to fully borrow from the bank.
And many experts have already started talking about a possible strong rise in prices for apartments.
But as it turned out, not everyone agrees with this.

The scientist spoke about the possible scientific program of the Russian expedition to the moon
The head of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrukovich told RIA Novosti about a possible program of scientific research for Russian cosmonauts on the Moon.
According to him, now the scientific community is developing directions for such work.
&quot;There is no consolidated opinion yet,&quot; the scientist emphasized.
He noted that one option is to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the far side of the Moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
&quot;This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study space sources of radio emission,&quot; added Petrukovich.
He also believes that the moon could be used to test robotics, use local resources for construction.
In addition, the astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organic matter on the Earth&#39;s satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help determine how life appears on planets.
Earlier, the head of the Roscosmos corporation said that in an optimistic scenario, the Russian Federation could carry out a manned flight to the moon by 2030.
Offended customer dumped a basket of feces at a 7-Eleven store
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, is said to have had a grudge against a 7-Eleven convenience store manager who kicked him out of the store in May for inappropriate behavior.
And he decided to take revenge on his enemy in an original way.
At half past one in the night, he went into the store and dumped the contents of the basket he had brought along onto the floor and onto some of the goods on the shelves.
The basket contained feces and urine, which Simms &quot;borrowed&quot; from a nearby mobile dry closet.
Police officers who arrived at the scene arrested the &quot;avenger&quot;.
He was jailed and released pending trial on $ 300 bail.
He was charged with illegal intrusion into someone else&#39;s property and a criminal offense, and was also prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
While Simms&#39; crime looks more ridiculous than serious, the verdict can be quite harsh, as he has repeatedly violated the law in the past, including theft on a large scale, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, drunk driving and cruelty to animals. ...

The submarine was launched in March 2017, but the Navy will receive it in 2019.

Deutsche Welle writes about it.
The event was attended by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

- It is difficult for the guys to score goals.
Two teams met, which had two defeats before this meeting.
Came out &quot;on the teeth&quot;.
The special team played well, scoring two goals.
It can be seen that the guys have a very large psychological burden.
They are very in a hurry to complete attacks, so it doesn&#39;t work.
After such a time, you have to go through and move on.
- German Mikhailovich, how do you like Erofeev&#39;s game?
- You know, I really liked the game.
Emotional, nothing more, as we asked.
He climbed on the goal and created moments, as in the episode with Vitaly Kravtsov, when he did not score into an empty net.
Very impressed for the first game.
I think that we will continue to involve him in the games.

There was nothing I could do and it hurt a lot
Sergey Sirotkin: I couldn&#39;t do anything, and it was very painful
Russian pilot &quot;Williams&quot; Sergei Sirotkin commented on the result of the Russian Grand Prix race.
&quot;Honestly, I don&#39;t really want to talk about what&#39;s in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner I found myself between two cars, which immediately squeezed me.
I lost all the positions that I played at the start, instantly, right away.
I found myself in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We hoped that after the others entered the pit stop, we would find ourselves in &quot;clean air&quot; and the pace would return, but the rubber was gone.
Plus, I fought with my partner, I also had contact with him.
As I understand it, he was a little mistaken.
We found ourselves in such a situation on the most out-of-the-way track of the season, I could not do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don’t want to talk about it anymore, ”RIA Novosti quoted Sirotkin as saying.
Recall that Sirotkin finished 18th in the race at the Russian Grand Prix, the winner was the British Mercedes pilot Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev called the removal of Glushakov and Yeshchenko from the base of &quot;Spartak&quot; absurd
President of the Russian Tennis Federation (RTR) Shamil Tarpishchev commented on the suspension of football players of the Moscow “Spartak” Denis Glushakov and Andrei Yeshchenko from training with the main line-up after hearing the criticism of the head coach of the team Massimo Carrera, reports “Sport Weekend”.
Carrera&#39;s actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is utter nonsense.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
This only deepens the rift within the team.
Firstly, these are poems, you can read and perceive them as you like.
If I were Carrera, I would not have reacted to this in any way.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to have fun.
If Glushakov and Yeshchenko like it, this does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks flexibility in the perception of the situation.
And this does not serve the normal climate in the team.
Today “Spartak” has no game, so this situation did not need to be inflated at all.
Maybe just together it was worth laughing at it.
“Spartak” has a lot of things that are not in order in different lines;
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match, &quot;- said Tarpishchev.
The game of the two teams will take place on September 30 and will start at 19.00 Moscow time.
John Terry, who had previously turned down Spartak, took over the Chelsea youth team.
Pupils of &quot;Sirius&quot; discussed nature-like technologies with scientists
Pupils of the Sirius educational center in Sochi, members of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the Kurchatov Institute National Research Center.
The researchers spoke as part of the program of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Nature-Like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary &quot;Kurchatov Codes&quot;, during which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as a driving force of the development of civilization.
The scientist&#39;s lecture was published on the Sirius website.
The students learned that modern technology requires an enormous amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will help nature-like technologies, on which young scientists are working today.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
“The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal blessing.
This is the explosive growth of medical technology, the improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is also a second side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually the technological reproduction of the systems of living nature.
There is a downside - purposeful intervention in human life.
There are always risks.
A car appeared - people began to die under the wheels.
But they still use cars.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I create a new medical technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction &quot;, - quotes the scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the meeting participants.
The speakers were Yulia Dyakova, Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-nature-like technologies of the National Research Center &quot;Kurchatov Institute&quot;, and Vyacheslav Demin, head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-technologies.
The Sirius educational center in Sochi was created by the Talent and Success educational foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational center is the early identification, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online Olympiad on information security Cyber Calls would be sent to study at Sirius.

When the vibration magnitude reached 7.4, the tower began to collapse.
The 21-year-old dispatcher had to jump from a height of four floors.
During the fall, he suffered serious internal injuries, and doctors could not save him.
Russian submarine &quot;Kazan&quot; scared the United States
The Russian submarine Kazan poses the greatest threat to the US Navy.
This was stated by the American Rear Admiral Dave Johnson, reports Rosbalt with reference to The National Interest.
“We are facing a tough potential adversary.
It is enough just to look at Severodvinsk, &quot;he said, pointing to the predecessor model of Kazan.
According to the commander-in-chief of the US Navy in Europe, James Foggo, Russia is focused on modernizing its submarine fleet.
Macedonia: referendum failed due to low turnout
The referendum was intended to approve an agreement between the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to &quot;North Macedonia&quot;.
Greece objected to the use of the name of their historic province by the Macedonians.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav republic the opening of the path to NATO and later to the EU.
But, as reported by the EFE agency, only 34% of the turnout at the Sunday plebiscite &quot;did not reach&quot; the constitutional threshold of 50%.
At the same time, since the referendum was only of a consultative nature, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to abandon the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the polling stations closed, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of the republic&#39;s name change, said that if there were more votes cast, Macedonia would change its name, despite the unreachable quorum.

Kemerovo residents outraged a herd of sheep in the cemetery
On September 30, on the well-known Kemerovo page on the social network, a message from an eyewitness appeared that horned animals roam freely in one of the local cemeteries.
Animals in a large herd walked between the fences and plucked out the grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: some of the local residents noted that there is no harm in the presence of small ruminants in the cemetery, and their appetite can even help in clearing the area of weeds and thickets of grass, but some of the residents of the city did not have to soul:
&quot;These are graves, not pastures.
There is nothing for the rams to do there.
Of course, you can&#39;t say that they blaspheme about the rams, but it is still not the case. &quot;(The style is preserved) - the indignant woman from Kemerovo noted in her message.
One way or another, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will be taken soon.
Press and dominate - how is it right?
The word pressure does not exist.
That&#39;s right - dominate.
The word &quot;press&quot; in the meaning of &quot;gravitate, influence, influence&quot; exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word &quot;dominate&quot;.
We use this word, assuming that it comes from the word &quot;pressure&quot;.
But &quot;pressure&quot; and &quot;dominate&quot; are etymologically not only not close, but even in some sense opposite.
See for yourself.
Suffer (church-book, obsolete) - means &quot;enough, full, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy.&quot;
Contentment, pleasure are related words.
Previously, it still had the meaning &quot;not to depend on anything, to have a self-sufficient meaning&quot; - &quot;to dominate yourself.&quot;
Old Slavic &quot;dovlѣti&quot; is related to the words &quot;command&quot; and &quot;will&quot;.
To crush, to suppress are completely different.
These words have truly terrifying &quot;relatives&quot;: daos - &quot;wolf&quot; (crushing the sheep), deyja - &quot;to die&quot; and dvaidī - &quot;to oppress&quot;.
The similar phonetic appearance of the words &quot;pressure&quot; and &quot;dominate&quot;, as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we got this very &quot;d [a] inlet&quot;, which is also used in writing through &quot;a&quot;, which, in an amicable way, is wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of origin and development of these words.
So, that&#39;s right - dominate.
But this word is outdated, no longer used in its correct meaning.
If you want to point out that certain circumstances / people have a negative influence on you from above, use the word &quot;push&quot;.
You can also use the &quot;apply pressure&quot; construct, but remember that this is clerical.
Russia became the leader at the EuroSkills championship in Budapest
The Russian national team became the leader at the EuroSkills European Professional Skills Championship.
The event took place in Budapest, writes TASS.
General Director of the Union &quot;Young Professionals (WordSkills Russia)&quot; Robert Urazov stressed that this year the Russian team showed a record result, overtaking other countries &quot;both in the number and quality of medals.&quot;
The team has 19 awards, including nine gold, eight silver, two bronze and ten medallions for professionalism.
Gold award winners work in areas such as visual merchandising, graphic design, mobile robotics, hotel administration, network and system administration, web development, welding technology, and more.
The best representative of the Russian Federation in terms of the number of points scored at the championship was 19-year-old milling machine operator Mikhail Vorontsov.
The young man was awarded the Best of Nation award.
It is noted that the winners of the championship will receive prizes in the amount of up to 700 thousand rubles.
Cash prizes are also awarded to the championship winners.
Recall that the EuroSkills tournament was held in the capital of Hungary on September 25-29.
Our car is noticeably slower than a Mercedes.
Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen talks about qualifying for the Russian Grand Prix, following which he finished fourth.
&quot;Kimi, did you have a chance to compete for pole today?
How well was the car behaving? &quot;
“It looks like Mercedes were much faster today,” quotes Raikkonen F1News.Ru.
But the behavior of our car was the best since the start of the weekend. &quot;
“In the course of qualification, you were not inferior in speed to Sebastian Vettel, but in the end the gap was still noticeable.
What is the reason?&quot;
“My attempt went well, but then one of the Mercedes riders was ahead.
He was preparing to try and still managed to let me pass, but it looks like I wasted some time on this.
However, it is unlikely that this greatly influenced the result &quot;
&quot;It is very difficult to overtake in Sochi, will the start of the race be the key moment?&quot;
&quot;Perhaps yes, but you never know how things will turn out.
It won&#39;t be easy anyway, because our car is noticeably slower than Mercedes cars. &quot;

A friendly person presented the kid with an exclusive parking lot - Za Rulem magazine
Miracles do happen in our lives!
One of them was tweeted by German journalist Christie Diez.
She wrote on her page that her four-year-old son parked his treadmill (children&#39;s bike without pedals) near the same lamp post throughout the year.
And one morning, a cute sticker with a photo of a green bicycle and the words &quot;Only for him&quot; appeared on the post.
The delights of mom and baby knew no bounds.
Christie thanked the anonymous well-wisher and praised him for an interesting and fresh idea.
Her tweet quickly spread across the social network and made many people smile.
The comments to it were also remarkable:
&quot;How wonderful it is!&quot;
&quot;Thank you for the wonderful communication in this world.&quot;
&quot;I think there are many people in the world who are capable of such an act.&quot;
&quot;Unfortunately, they don&#39;t get the same attention as the antics of the villains.&quot;
&quot;This is the Peace that we need!&quot;
The readers asked the journalist, if suddenly she still managed to find out who was the author of this idea, tell about it.
After all, this man, apparently, is somewhere nearby: he more than once watched how the baby was parked, since this occurred to him.

It will be interesting to watch his performances next year &quot;, - quotes Alyoshin SMP Racing.

Russian bailiffs demanded a debt from a dead old woman
In Kurgan, bailiffs demanded that a long-dead woman pay a state fee of 200 rubles.
This is reported by the &quot;Ural Meridian&quot;.
In mid-September, relatives of the late Maria Mitrofanovna Slepneva received a letter from the Kurgan department of bailiffs, in which it was reported that enforcement proceedings had been initiated against a 105-year-old woman.
According to the verdict of the court, the woman must pay 200 rubles to the local tax office.
After receiving the letter, Slepneva&#39;s relatives turned to the department for clarification.
The bailiffs department promised to deal with the situation.
Users of social networks, having learned about the incident, advised relatives to file counterclaims for non-payment of pensions and social benefits to the old woman for the years &quot;lived&quot; after her death.
In 2016, in Kemerovo, a court declared a man alive, who, according to documents, was considered dead.
The death mark was supposed to be given to his full namesake, but the record was mistakenly made to the wrong person.

Vucic upheld the highest level of combat readiness of the Serbian army
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic ordered to keep in force the highest level of combat readiness, to which the country&#39;s Armed Forces were brought due to the situation in the north of the autonomous region of Kosovo and Metohija.
&quot;The President ordered to maintain the highest level of combat readiness, there will be a separate order to cancel it,&quot; said Serbian Defense Minister Alexander Vulin on Sunday, quoted by TASS.

This was done in connection with the visit to the north of the province of the President of Kosovo, Hashim Thaçi.
After some time, the Kosovo special forces left their positions.
It was after this that the President of Serbia brought the country&#39;s armed forces and police special forces to full combat readiness, and also protested to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

The action was supported by over 450 organizations that came out under the slogan &quot;Together against racism&quot;.
The organizers initially announced that about 30 thousand demonstrators would take part in the rally, who would call on the authorities to refuse to deport migrants from the country and defend the right of people to protection and asylum, writes the Zeit newspaper.
Also, the participants of the event stated that the rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean should cease to be considered an offense.

One of the participants of the action, Neuroz Duman, said that the purpose of the demonstration was to show the unity of society and solidarity in this problem.
Refugees and migrants should not be considered different, and migration itself is the mother of this society.
Numerous migrant communities and anti-racist organizations have sent an open letter to the Minister demanding his resignation.
with the help of the operation in Syria, Russia protected itself from terrorists
Over the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100 thousand terrorists were killed, of which 85 thousand terrorists were destroyed by the Aerospace Forces of the Russian Federation.
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former commander-in-chief of the Aerospace Forces, head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of weapons of destruction from the air: the Aerospace Forces have inflicted and continue to deliver all strikes precisely at the targets of terrorists.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria in three years, for example, ammunition depots, fortified areas and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the defense of the jihadists was hacked - this was a decisive contribution to the advancement of the Syrian government forces, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria made it possible to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the side of IS, TASS reports.
And we are talking only about the fixed persons, not counting those who were not identified, Bondarev emphasized.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at distant frontiers - otherwise this evil &quot;would have rushed to us.&quot;
The phones of Boris Johnson and a number of British ministers are in the public domain
The personal data of a number of former and current UK ministers were made public due to a security failure in an application created by the Conservative Party, Sky News reports.
In particular, the mobile phone numbers of Finance Minister Philip Hammond and ex-British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson turned out to be available.
According to the TV channel, several politicians received &quot;unpleasant calls&quot;.
The technical issue has been resolved and the application is now safe to use.
We are investigating the reasons for the failure and apologize for any problems caused, &quot;said the Conservative Party.
During the crash, users could not only see confidential data, but also edit information in the profiles of politicians and journalists.
So, in the profile of the Minister of Environment, Ecology and Agriculture Michael Gove, his photo was replaced with a photo of the media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Syria accused the United States of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, destroyed infrastructure and public services in targeted areas, and massacred civilians, including children and women.
These killings are war crimes under international law, &quot;he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and its partners provided &quot;direct support to terrorists&quot;, since the goals of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant &quot;sowing chaos, death and destruction along the way.&quot;
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost complete, and the country has become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria of illegal foreign presence, and priority in rebuilding the country will be given to the Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for the Reconciliation of Warring Parties in the republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15 planes attacked the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with banned phosphorus munitions.
The US denied all charges.
President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on the issuance of their passports by Hungary in Transcarpathia.
By defending Ukrainian citizens, I am defending the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine, &quot;Poroshenko stressed.
According to Poroshenko, he, as president, will protect Ukrainian citizens, wherever they are - in the east or west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Foreign Ministry in the passport scandal with Hungary, which consists in the intention to expel the consul of this country from Beregovo.
&quot;I fully share every letter that is said to the Foreign Ministry,&quot; the President noted.
As reported by &quot;FACTS&quot;, on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment when Hungarian passports were issued to citizens of Ukraine at the Hungarian Consulate in Beregovo.
At the same time, they aloud took an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavel Klimkin noted that the Hungarian consul, who appears in the video with the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave the territory of Ukraine either by decision of Budapest itself, or will be expelled by Kiev.
It also became known that the Prosecutor&#39;s Office of the Transcarpathian region opened a criminal case on the issue of Hungarian passports.
The incident is qualified under the article &quot;High treason&quot;.
Putin secretly flew to Siberia
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the Council of CIS States, and also held a number of bilateral meetings with the presidents of neighboring countries.
Data on the flights of the Russian &quot;plane number 1&quot; on the Flightradar website indicate that at about 6 pm Tajik time on September 28, the Il-96-300 departed from Dushanbe airport and headed north-east.
In the area of Lake Balkhash, the plane&#39;s transponder was turned off.
The direction of its flight suggests that the liner could fly to Khakassia.
According to the agency &quot;Baikal24&quot;, the president in Abakan on the night of September 29 was met personally by the head of the region Viktor Zimin.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic to spend the weekend, but the sources of the site believe that the real reason is &quot;the problem of the second round.&quot;
Next Sunday, the second round of elections for the head of the region should take place in Khakassia.
Valentin Konovalov (KPRF) and the current head of the republic Viktor Zimin (United Russia) entered it.
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
Andrey Filyagin (&quot;Fair Russia&quot;) should take part in the upcoming round together with Konovalov.
Khakassian media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and appoint a new acting head of the republic, as well as decide on the fate of Zimin.
Putin has already visited Khakassia in January this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president&#39;s favorite vacation spots.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict in Syria for seven years.
About five million people fled to other countries, primarily to neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, hostilities are nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said this at the UN: “At present, the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure thanks to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The government continues reconstruction work in areas destroyed by terrorists, returning them to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that made life difficult for people and deprived them of their livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and to allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, stating that a political solution to the conflict must be found first.
Volkswagen fully pleaded guilty to Dieselgate in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the American division of the company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The group&#39;s losses are estimated at at least 25 billion euros.
This amount includes not only fines and compensations.
Until June next year, the automaker is obliged to buy or fix 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the management of the company said that the obligations have already been fulfilled for 83% of cars, so the program will be completed ahead of schedule.
Volkswagen is doing its best to compensate for losses and regain customer confidence.
For example, the management of the concern has recently changed again, and a large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesel engines on their streets: the authorities received such a right in February this year.
Approaching typhoon paralyzed traffic in Japan
Japan&#39;s largest rail operator Japan Railways has announced the suspension of high-speed trains due to the approaching typhoon Trami.
The restriction from 17:00 (from 11:00 Moscow time) will apply to routes between the central region with the western and southwestern parts of the country.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Synodal Department for External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate into the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against Jews.
&quot;It&#39;s the same as putting a yellow pointed star on a Jew in Nazi Germany, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and this bill was created for this very purpose,&quot; the metropolitan said on the Russia-24 TV channel (quoted by &quot; Interfax &quot;).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Thus, Kiev hopes to gain full control over the UOC and &quot;put it outside the law,&quot; the clergyman believes.
&quot;This is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country,&quot; he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter presupposes the renaming of the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Viceroy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The abbot of the Holy Dormition Pochaev Lavra, Metropolitan Volodymyr, made an appeal to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his appeal to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the monastery&#39;s website.
At different times in history, our predecessors and relatives in faith and spirit, Christians had to confess their faith and defend their shrines.
Taking into account the situation that has developed, and according to the information that we have, and the threats of reprisals that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to go through something, &quot;the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
Also, the governor of the Lavra stressed that, probably, &quot;your physical presence will be needed.&quot;
The priest added: &quot;Lenin&#39;s grandchildren are in spirit, they threaten with reprisal, and therefore we will defend our shrine.&quot;
Whoever is not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Lavra, an Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, must be ready to defend it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to follow the lead of those who mislead the faithful.
The UOC has a canonical status, determined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to make him dependent on the new-style patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are pleased with the status that our church has, &quot;said the governor of the Lavra.
He recalled that since October 1990, the UOC has been canonically independent and completely independent in its governance.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, our church already has a Tomos.
What other Tomos do we need? &quot;- said Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaev, urging believers and all citizens to ask the question, do other confessions have a Tomos, are they independent from the Vatican?
Believers to some extent figured out and decided which church they should go to.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some are seized with envy that the domes on the churches that they want to destroy are shining, &quot;the priest emphasized.
Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
Lavra is located on the top of Pochaev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the XIII century.

Another sad post by Buzova on Instagram angered subscribers
Singer and TV presenter Olga Buzova cannot survive the &quot;betrayal&quot; of the participant in the show &quot;Marry Buzov&quot; Yevgeny Nazarov, who preferred money to her and left the project.
The socialite published another sad post on Instagram, which angered her subscribers.
“I never thought that feelings could have a price.
Life still continues to teach me ... and when I start to understand people, &quot;- wrote Buzova.
Many fans reacted negatively to this post and noted that in fact, the singer &quot;did not see the real life.&quot;
&quot;You haven&#39;t suffered yet.
You cling to every word, live in a normal, ordinary family, &quot;wrote @ nataliamama37.
There were also those who advised Buzova to consult psychologists or at least read books on this topic.
&quot;Maybe you should read the literature on psychology?
What should be done in order not to pose as a victim? &quot;- wrote @liashukgalina.
However, there were those who supported the singer.
&quot;Olya, you, most importantly, do not be upset.
Your man will not speak loud words all over the country and then simply will not fulfill them, &quot;- @arina_prostyle supported Buzova.
&quot;You are a queen and you need a king, and the one who exchanged you for pieces of paper is simply not worthy of you.
Above your nose and move on, &quot;wrote @kreszentia_f.
Earlier, Nazarov explained his decision to take 2 million rubles and abandon Buzova by the fact that the singer has no sympathy for him.
He decided to send all the money to charity.
If we continue to play the same way, victories will come.
The head coach of Dynamo Moscow, Vladimir Vorobyov, on the defeat to Avtomobilist (0: 1) in the KHL regular championship match.
&quot;It was a good game, interesting, although it went to the goal&quot; - the official site of &quot;Avtomobilist&quot; quotes Vorobiev as saying.
&quot;We tried to play very simply.
I liked the first period very much.
Didn&#39;t use a few good points.
In the second period, the opponent squeezed us a little, we held out.
But the removal gave us a little bit of food.
The guys played great, followed the coach&#39;s instructions.
I think if we continue to play the same way, victories will come.
We didn’t score, no games won with zero goals, but the content of the game was correct.
Good luck will come if we continue to play in this direction. &quot;
&quot;In your opinion, has Avtomobilist added in comparison with the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?&quot;
&quot;Then the foreign link did not play.
In the preseason, the teams solved other problems, a lot of young guys played.
I think it was a completely different game, different hockey.
&quot;Avtomobilist&quot; is a good solid team.
It is clear from the standings that the team is playing correctly.
Good hockey, good atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
We can only wish them good luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
There are many good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were preparing.
We knew that the team was going without defeat, they wanted to turn it around, but it didn&#39;t work out. &quot;

Top Macedonian opposition figure refused to vote in referendum
In Macedonia on Sunday, September 30, a referendum is being held on the issue of an intergovernmental agreement with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: &quot;Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?&quot;
Nevertheless, Christian Mitskoski, leader of the leading opposition party, Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE), said he would not vote in the referendum.
As explained by the press secretary of the party Naum Stoilkovsky, Mitskoski decided to abstain from voting in order to express his disagreement with the agreement, which he considers &quot;harmful&quot;.
According to the spokesman, the current referendum decides on renaming the country and nothing more, while the strategic goal of the party is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov also refused to participate in the September 30 referendum.
He explained that he chose the name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence. the Macedonian leader considers the renaming of the country a negative factor.

This agreement should resolve a long-term dispute over the name of the country, as well as Skopje&#39;s path to NATO and the EU, reminds TASS.

US satisfied with growth in opiate production in Afghanistan
The sharp aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 was much talked about in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on Afghan territory, the militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year has become a record for the number of bloody terrorist attacks, as a result of which thousands of ordinary Afghans were killed, &quot;Patrushev said.
Afghanistan&#39;s troubles did not begin yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Al-Qaeda terrorist group (banned in the Russian Federation), which settled in Afghanistan, was declared the main enemy of the United States.
Less than a month later, America and its NATO allies launched the military operation Enduring Freedom there.
17 years have passed.
The thousands-strong American contingent is still on Afghan soil.
And a peaceful life is even more illusory than it was then.
American troops have been driven over the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they pay off the militants for money - so long as they are not touched.
The Afghan government controls a smaller part of the country&#39;s territory - 40 percent, according to Patrushev.
50% belongs to the Taliban movement (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But on the other hand, they grow rapidly there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly the one that failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be happy with this.
As well as the fact that over the 17 years of the American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
Colossal growth in areas planted with opium poppy and multibillion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on June 17 as the result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor&#39;s right to be called Macedonia, seeing in such a name an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lyupko Petkovsky, political scientist: “Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social change.
And Greece will secure the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise from difficult compromises and cannot make absolutely everyone happy. &quot;
The ruling Social Democrats, headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are in favor of renaming the country.
Against - the conservative opposition and the country&#39;s President Gheorghe Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, it makes no sense for Macedonia to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: “Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, headed by Zaev, was imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country ...
But this decision will entail negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not like Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans. &quot;
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole. &quot;
