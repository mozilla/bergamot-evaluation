TikTok hides undesirable videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which - under 18 years of age
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok censored videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet's independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong, The Guardian says.
The documents found in the publication, says that the owner of TikTok (company ByteDance) with the help of the application promotes the foreign policy of China abroad.
Most of the violations concerning China's policy fall under "incitement to hatred."
In each case, TikTok places undesirable publications in a context that is appropriate to general rules so that the actions of the social network do not look censored.
For example, the ban on criticism of the socialist system of China falls under the general ban "criticism or attacks on politics and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc. d..
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under "distortion of the history of China or other countries."
The document also lists the list of banned names of twenty "foreign leaders or state officials," including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, American presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Pak Kain, President of Indonesia and President of Indonesia Jodno.
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.
Publications from the first category are removed by social network administrators and may result in blocking the user.
Not too severe violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: "Now we use a localized approach for moderation, and we also attract independent local specialists."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, says the co-founder of the "Producer Center" Rustem Bogdanov.
"Producer Center" is one of Russian media companies, which officially cooperates with TikTok.
All advertising materials of bloggers "Producer Center" coordinates with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be placed without agreement, Bogdanov reports.
When asked whether TikTok can speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov responds affirmatively and says he has seen such publications.
Our Didgigital founder Roman Zaripov agrees with Bogdanov: "The main rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: it is impossible to post shocking content, discriminating statements and so on."
But under these rules you can sum up any content that does not like the moderators, says Zaripov.
Zaripov's agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which - under 18 years.
According to the user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
Social network administrators check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: neuronet analyzes the face and determines how many years a person looks, says Bogdanov.
If the neuronet decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019. ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the WeWork co-working area.

Spanish "Barcelona" and its former Brazilian footballer Neymar are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the striker joined the French "Paris Saint-Germain."
The case almost reached the court, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Femida.

Accordingly, the club believes that the player was only a quarter of 40 million euros and require a return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and "Barsa" almost agreed to return the "wandering" player in the bosom of Catalonia.
However, the deal failed, but the hope for the reverse transition of the forward remains.
And now, according to Athletes.Ru, referring to insiders, the club lawyers told the players that if the issue of financial claims will not be handled in pre-trial procedure, it will exclude the possibility of returning the Brazilian.
Neymar himself wants to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans would buy him back.

Will phytoestrogens and phytolandogens help prolong youth?
The theme of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
Of the most famous - pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are researched well and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (among them cardiovascular, some types of cancer).

Among its main elements - only voluntary procedure for joining the system of savings, guaranteeing the safety of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registration of accumulative accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax incentives for business and tax deductions for citizens.

Recall that in late August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited for import into Russia within the framework of countersanctions.
The document, posted on the official portal of legal information, noted that the rules are extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the decision to destroy the sanctions was applied to products from the USA, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine joined this list.
The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of the illegally imported "sanctions" (products caught under the food embargo, which Moscow introduced in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) came into force in 2015.

As the sanctions of the West remain, Russia has also prolonged its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, the products that citizens import for personal use, this measure does not apply.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.

After that, a similar recommendation was given to the government by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.
Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that it is wrong to destroy food, and it is necessary to think how to use them for their purpose, assessing the quality.

According to ESO, this week officially began the construction of the dome of the building, where the telescope E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope - "European ultra-large telescope"), while the most expensive and ambitious ground astronomical project will be located.
Its total value, according to ESO, will exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope - its record large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments of 1.4 meters.
This is a huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflective surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters will help E-ELT get the first detailed photos of planets outside the Solar System, stars in other galaxies, as well as look for doubles of the Earth.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome is only started, mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total value was about 400 million euros, received the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
