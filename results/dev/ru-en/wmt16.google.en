The social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the preservation of benefits for travel in public passenger transport.
From September 24, the procedure for organizing reduced travel for citizens using a social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is changing.
According to the press service of the Russian government in the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of benefits for travel in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 FZ &quot;On the National Payment System&quot;.
In this case, the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changing.
So, the top-up limit is now set not on trips, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter no more than 400 rubles, in summer - no more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now, holders of a social card on receipts issued in transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the balance of funds.
The cost of a reduced fare for citizens will be 1/2 of the carrier&#39;s tariff.
The remaining half of the fare is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule for replenishing the social card with cash remains the same - in the period from the 24th day of the previous month to the 23rd day of the current month.
The new social card travel procedure will have a number of advantages.
So, it becomes possible to keep a detailed record of spending money on a social card with an accuracy of kopecks.
In addition, it becomes possible to return credited, but unspent funds.
We also add that the scheme of settlements with carriers becomes transparent, since now half of the fare is paid by a citizen, and exactly the same amount is reimbursed to the carrier by the budget.
No commission will be charged when depositing funds to the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, deputy head of the department of road facilities and transport of the Ivanovo region, said that in 2014 more than 33 million trips were made in the region using a social card, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
In the regional budget, more than 470 million rubles are provided for the provision of preferential travel for citizens using a social card.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
On a 911 call, the teacher confesses to the murder of his girlfriend
During the 911 call, in an almost non-trembling voice, university professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that they needed employees to come to their home.
Lamb stressed that there is a &quot;doggie&quot; in the house, who is alive, but probably upset, and said that the contacts of the family members of the deceased can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss&#39;s body and a handwritten note on a white piece of lined paper: &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I wish I could get it back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me.&quot; - reads the note, according to representatives of the authorities, signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had traveled 300 miles to the university campus by then, where police believe he shot and killed respected history professor Ethan Schmidt. on the threshold of his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university staff learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that truthful 911 call shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day, there will be one more casualties: Lamb committed suicide as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, law enforcement officials were still trying to piece together the motives behind Lamba.
The information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped shape the portrait of a talented but possibly worried teacher.
The students said that they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gauthier, where Prentiss died, said he had no rape or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he expressed gratitude to the &quot;wonderful people&quot; with whom he crossed paths in his teaching life.
They both taught in the 17 faculty members of the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well of Lamba, Brandon Beevers, reported that he also appeared anxious and nervous, &quot;as if there was something wrong with him.&quot;
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 academic year about how he dealt with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some kind of health problem.
He has taught only two online courses this year.
Recent changes in university recruitment rules meant that the doctorate degree, which Lamb worked so hard to achieve, would not automatically guarantee him a teaching position.
University President William La Forge said he was unaware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but &quot;obviously Mr. Lamb had something on his mind.&quot;
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
Police followed Lamb&#39;s trail after escaping from campus as he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a 38-caliber single-shot pistol in his backyard, one mile south of his parents&#39; home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County coroner Metel Johnson said.
His car, with the engine running, was still parked in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb came to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb started at a university with 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his Ph.D. in Education in the spring of that year.
One of Lamba&#39;s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and cheerful.
Karla Hairston revealed that she was 15 and Lambu 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who had been trying to teach her to play guitar for several years.
In those years, he enjoyed success with women.
All the girls melted when he was around, &quot;says Hairston, now 40 and who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time at the time of the events.
On a 911 call, Lamb said, “I killed my wife,” but there is no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in Gauthier in a brick house, the back of which overlooks the canal.
According to the police, the dog is fine.
Prentiss&#39; ex-husband, Sean O&#39;Steen, revealed that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
&quot;She&#39;s completely depressed,&quot; O&#39;Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O&#39;Steen said he did not meet with Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O&#39;Steen said that his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Schaffer, bartender and entertainment coordinator at the dimly lit The Julep Room on the outskirts of Gaultier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica for a few diners.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We had fun and made fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, the deceased teacher, taught freshman workshops and majored in Native American and Colonial American history, ”said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same institution.
He was married and had three small children.
He attended the University of Kansas at Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student government.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university faculty, staff, students and community members, participated in a memorial candlelight ceremony.
Schmidt&#39;s wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We are trying to get our students back,” La Forge said.
The crisis is over.
Today is the day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was helped by Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in response to police allegations that Lamb&#39;s call came to 911 after Schmidt&#39;s assassination, and even though Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, information that that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it will not be hiring as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, while the toys and baby products retailer says it will give full-time staff and temporary workers the opportunity to work longer hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from the 45,000 it hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will begin interviewing applicants this month and will increase its headcount from October to December.
While the holidays are still a few months away, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are gearing up to hire temporary workers in order to have enough staff in stores and selling, shipping and delivering goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about &quot;date&quot; with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a big deal for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
&quot;We were sitting in the cinema and waiting for the arrival of the royal family, I noticed that the seat next to me was free, and then it dawned on me that Princess Diana would be sitting next to me,&quot; he said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in time&quot;.
The film begins, and then it occurs to me that I am literally at arm&#39;s length and one fake yawn from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about Back to the Future, includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The film &quot;Back to the Future&quot; premiered 30 years ago.
&quot;For me,&quot; Spielberg says, &quot;this is undeniably the greatest time travel movie ever made.&quot;
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has said in response to Russia&#39;s military support for Syria that there is &quot;no military solution&quot; to the nearly five-year conflict, and the rise in weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent councilors - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that the differences in the council, as well as among the Syrians and local authorities, &quot;made the situation insoluble.&quot;
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they showed in addressing the issue of Iran&#39;s nuclear program and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 poll results that show Donald Trump is not kidding
Some tried to label him as a provocateur.
Others brushed it off as a joke.
And some require a scandal.
But no matter how hard some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump&#39;s high position in the polls, they have not succeeded (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump&#39;s double-digit lead, and some are starting to seriously ask what this means for the real estate tycoon in terms of the chances of getting a nomination.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means Trump has a chance of being nominated by the GOP.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry was losing out on his predominantly gaining popularity to Herman Kane, none of whom won even one state in the nominating process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in the general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush&#39;s Political Action Supercommittee and the economic conservative Growth Club recognize Trump&#39;s unrelenting strength and begin to leverage their dollars to topple him.
Here are some survey numbers that suggest that the real estate tycoon is more than just an interim phase:
Trump&#39;s sympathy ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll at Monmouth University found that only two out of 10 Republicans viewed the real estate tycoon favorably.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators prevail in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there are positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would have arranged for Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN / ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be &quot;enthusiastic&quot; or &quot;pleased&quot; if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be &quot;upset&quot; if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be &quot;enthusiastic&quot; versus 40 percent of those who say the same about Trump).
Next in excitement?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they will be &quot;dissatisfied&quot; or &quot;upset&quot; if establishment leader Jeb Bush becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don&#39;t see Trump&#39;s temperament as an issue.
While Trump is massively criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters across the country think the tycoon has the right temperament to be president, an ABC News / Washington post poll found Monday.
The same figure featured at the nation&#39;s first caucus in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the very man who could be the top commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think he is not the kind of person to be effective in office, and nearly six in 10 independent voters say his temperament is not right for the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their connoisseur hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
When asked who the most likely winner of the GOP nomination is, four out of 10 said Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN / ORC poll last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of 10 were bet on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full Disclosure: GOP voters didn&#39;t have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported the possible candidate Mitt Romney.
However, it shows that a multitude of GOP voters find Trump&#39;s campaign compelling.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that such a spread most likely plays to Trump&#39;s advantage, and at the same time, those who do not support Trump are evenly distributed among more than a dozen other supporters.
But a poll by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets majority support.
He is ahead of Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He has a draw with Ted Cruise.
The only candidate who bypasses him?
Ben Carson beat the businessman by a whopping 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one competition.
Just over half of Donald Trump&#39;s supporters say they&#39;ve changed their minds.
A new CBS / NYT poll conducted on Tuesday shows that only more than half of Trump-backed voters say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and make a difference, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, Trump&#39;s tightest competition so far is with fellow underdog neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have changed their mind are likely to elect Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants &quot;rapists&quot; two months ago in his inaugural speech, immigration has become the hottest topic of conversation in 2016.
Some worry that Trump&#39;s posturing will alienate key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and thwart rebranding.
But six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration, according to an ABC / Post poll conducted on Monday.
So as long as immigration gets everyone&#39;s attention, it looks like Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Frustration with the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on support from about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans on Monday in a new ABC / Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they also resent Washington.
A poll by the Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa, conducted two weeks ago, shows that three in four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent &quot;dissatisfied&quot; and 21 percent &quot;furious.&quot;
The government will decide the fate of pension indexations in October.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options for implementing the law on indexing pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation, reports RG.
She noted that a solution should be found by October 8, by the time the draft budget for next year is submitted to the government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the funded pension of Russians.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings is 350 billion rubles.
The indexation of pensions in full for the next year costs about the same.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is still no final decision on the issue of who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Golodets believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong, at the same time, to socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are eyelids often irritated and reddened?
Ophthalmologist Tatyana Levashova answers:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from many small particles that settle on them.
Forgetting about regular cleaning of the eyelids, we often ourselves contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The way out is simple:
do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, carry with you a special wet eyelid wipe;
at least 1-2 times a day, clean the edges of the eyelids from harmful substances accumulated in them during the day.
It is not out of place to supplement the cleansing procedures with warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (sage, chamomile), which thin the thick secretion of the sebaceous glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out with circular movements of the fingertips;
When removing makeup, do not use alcohol-based products.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and further thicken the secretion of the sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear scientists have created a nuclear warhead.
North Korean officials said the country&#39;s main nuclear reactor, the Yongbyon nuclear complex, is operating &quot;at full capacity.&quot;
A message about this appeared on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that the DPRK is at any time ready to respond to the &quot;aggression and nuclear threat of the United States,&quot; and also that the country has improved its nuclear weapons &quot;both in quantity and quality.&quot;
The last nuclear test was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
At the same time, no plans to resume full-fledged operation of the reactor have been reported since then.
Pyongyang claims to have built an atomic warhead.
Also, the DPRK has repeatedly tested medium and short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded that the mention of fraternal peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He stated this during a meeting of the State Duma, reports &quot;Russian news service&quot;.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
&quot;A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even the athletes can&#39;t stand it,&quot; Zhirinovsky said.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the quatrains that contain this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to &quot;God Save the Tsar,&quot; and the Russian tricolor should be replaced with the imperial flag, polit.ru writes.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to cope with the refugee problem, then they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether Europe is accepting or not accepting refugees, but whether the root causes of this problem need to be addressed.
If the Europeans are concerned about the fate of the refugees, let them stop supporting the terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
&quot;This is the essence of the refugee issue,&quot; he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue our dialogue to reach consensus.
However, if we want real success, it is impossible as long as people are dying, as long as the bloodshed continues and as long as people do not feel completely safe.
&quot;Thus, we can reach a consensus, but we cannot implement anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria,&quot; Assad said.
Recall that about 500 thousand migrants arrived in the EU countries this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission said that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that among the migrants arriving in Europe there may be thousands of militants of the Islamic State extremist group.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation in order to create their own cells in the EU to conduct terrorist activities.
Residents of the German city arranged a holiday for the refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become the leader in receiving refugees, although it recently tightened border controls to contain the influx.
The authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts cite significantly higher numbers.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90 thousand refugees have already arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill has visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents give migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut in a session of questions to the Prime Minister
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, his debut in the questioning session to the Prime Minister is eagerly awaited.
New Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn will soon address the Prime Minister&#39;s first questioning session, facing off against David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbin will speak with the first of six reserved questions in the afternoon; his performance is likely to be closely followed by the press and Labor MPs.
He made the call for &quot;less theater and more facts&quot; in a weekly demo speech.
He also said that he could skip some meetings, leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will mark the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as a leader; it comes after his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Trades union congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labor leader&#39;s decision to stand silent while singing the national anthem at a service on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, drew criticism from a number of conservative MPs and became the subject of several editorials in newspapers.
Mr Corbin&#39;s decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he &quot;stood in respectful silence&quot; and acknowledged &quot;the heroism of the RAF in the Battle of Britain.&quot;
However, Mr. Corbin&#39;s shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labor leader to sing the national anthem &quot;regardless&quot; of his belief in the need to end the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play on Mr. Corbyn&#39;s team, voicing differences over economics, defense and international politics, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party members supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brunt says political divisions are also &quot;piling up&quot; in the Labor Party following the appointment of Mr. Corbin to a position in the European Union and government restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin told the Trade Union conference that the Labor Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the very idea of restrictions altogether.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow secretary of labor and pensions, said there was &quot;complete clarity&quot; within the party that it was only in opposition to the government&#39;s plans to cut the ceiling from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth Labor leader David Cameron will meet at the courier box in a decade since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labor leader, who pledged a different approach to politics, says he &quot;mobilized collective resources&quot; to get Mr. Cameron&#39;s ideas for questions and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Islington North County MP said that asking the Prime Minister was unnecessarily confrontational and that he would refrain from witty answers and barbs, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the economy secretary in the shadow cabinet, will replace him on matters for the prime minister when he is absent - for example, when Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea of letting other colleagues take the floor if possible, saying that he approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Burkow, to discuss the matter.
After becoming a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to move away from the &quot;fairground&quot; political style often associated with questioning the prime minister, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since their first broadcast in 1990, questions to the prime minister have become a key indicator of a leader&#39;s views, ability to rule the House of Commons and reputation with other members of Parliament, although critics say this has become a caricature and requires extensive reform.
&quot;Filmed in Joburg&quot; Homeless young people trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tricky place for the homeless.
But one group of ex-street kids found a way to learn a craft and make a living.

Pound Sterling Rises As UK Salaries Rise
The pound rose on the back of rising wages in the UK, while the FTSE 100 rallied on an offer to buy SABMiller.
Between May and June, UK earnings excluding bonuses were up 2.9% year-over-year.
The growth rate turned out to be the highest since 2009, and was greeted as a postponement of forecasts for a possible increase in quotations.
The pound sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $ 1.5505, and 0.84% against the euro to € 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 Index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
Shares of SABMiller stood out against the general background, which grew by 20% thanks to a buy offer from competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together two of the world&#39;s largest brewing companies, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry rose 0.9% on encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont&#39;s latest sales figures exceeded expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - were picking up again.
Glencore shares surged 5% after the mining giant said it was able to raise $ 2.5 billion through a share placement as part of a debt-cutting strategy.
Paper and packaging group Mondi were the top performers in the index - down 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs downgraded the group to Sell.
JD Sports rallied after the sportswear company posted an 83% increase in pre-tax profit in half a year to £ 46.6m.
JD Sports chief says higher salaries may hinder expansion
JD Sports chief executive Peter Cowgill says raising the minimum wage for UK workers means &quot;more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.&quot;
But such purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the rise in labor costs, he says.
The costs could have affected plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer additional vacancies.
Metcash Launches Bottom-Up Campaign to Fight Aldi Onslaught
Metcash is trying to defend its IGA stores from Aldi&#39;s onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.
A bottom-up food wholesaler has launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of Aldi&#39;s upcoming $ 700 million infusion.
As Aldi prepares to open two wholesalers and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media. events like &quot;Adelaide Show&quot;.
IGA retailers and suppliers are joining the campaign, such as ice cream maker Simmo&#39;s in Dunsborough, which offers tastings at IGA stores, and store owners selling discount tickets to the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details on its defense strategy on September 29 - the day that wholesale food, liquor and household goods provider will hold its annual Investor Strategy Day.
Much is at stake, with IGA-branded stores in South Australia and Western Australia accounting for nearly 30% of all Metcash stores and performing better than Metcash IGA in the Eastern states.
Shoppers in South and Western Australia are known to be on route, so the market is more favorable to IGA retailers than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Africa and 24 percent in WA, compared with about 14 percent in the East. states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley estimate that Aldi will take 5 percent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all players present, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report released this week, Tom Keerat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, believes IGA retailers could lose $ 360 million in sales in a year, and Metcash could lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, achieving sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in these markets, respectively.
Loss of revenue and sales of food products at high fixed costs for Metcash could cost the company about 13 million in pre-interest and tax revenue, Mr. Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, despite a recent Morgan Survey finding that IGA has the most loyal customers.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company&#39;s market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Lead fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, remarked to those in attendance at a business lunch in Melbourne last week that Metcash &quot;has a high likelihood of disappearing within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly comment on Mr Douglass&#39;s comments.
But a member of the Metcash board of directors is believed to have contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA&#39;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash&#39;s food business revenue, which the company supplies to about 1,200 IGA retailers, fell 43 percent from 2012 due to operational deleveraging and pressure on sales figures. and profitability.
However, the company is not giving up, spending more than $ 150 million annually to equalize retail prices with Coles and Woolworths for 1,000 items each week and helping IGA retailers redesign their marketplaces, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh produce and a wider range of branded products. food products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says the price equalization and retrofitting of retail space is gaining momentum and hopes the company will see a net profit increase in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism, for her behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly affected by the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more credit for his behavior than criticism, says Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest in the talented duo and often referred to as &quot;Special Ks&quot;, has unwittingly found himself in the spotlight due to Kiryos&#39; shameful skirmish with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, during a heated qualifying match in Cincinnati, the umpire had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, while Harrison said: &quot;Wawrinka should have put Kiryos on his shoulder blades, and I should have put this guy on his shoulder blades.&quot;
Ever since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racquet after a cramp in his leg saved Richard Gasquet from a possible defeat at the US Open, Healy has been loyally defending Kokkinakis.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, vying with Sam Groth for the right to place second to Bernard Tomic in singles in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Great Britain.
&quot;One thing I am acutely worried about is that Tanasi has been dragged into the conflict,&quot; Healy said.
He did break his racquet when he knocked his foot in the US Open, but he is not the first player to break the racket when hopes dashed, and I know Tanashi well enough to be sure he wouldn&#39;t be proud of it.
But in fact he has held himself very well in some pretty provocative situations on the US, with Harrison, etc., and I&#39;m sure he&#39;s trustworthy.
He has a great team around him, he has a wonderful family, and I just think that he was treated a little dishonestly.
He is a very mature 19 year old man, he works hard, fits perfectly into the team, he has never had problems with other players, he is respected off the court, he trains intensively, he is in great shape, he is a very determined and developed young man, and I think it should be appreciated.
Healy also backed the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match starting on Friday, believing &quot;consensus&quot; was the right option for everyone, but hoping that the Canberra guy would return to the team as a long-term player.
&quot;First and foremost, we want the team to focus entirely on the match and not on the disputes around [Kiryos],&quot; Healy said.
And I think Nick gained strength very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray prove, he grows up in front of the public, he made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he receives, but we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions. and it is necessary, I believe, to take him out of the spotlight for a while so that he can reflect on them, which is best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares emergency, closes border, detains migrants
In declaring a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday closed its border with Serbia at its southern border and is detaining those attempting to enter the country illegally to contain the influx of migrants.
Riots broke out at the border - hundreds of migrants accumulated on the border area, to which the Serbian authorities reacted sharply.
Stuck indefinitely on a stretch of road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland pitched tents and settled in the area.
However, discontent was growing.
When a police helicopter circled above them, the migrants shouted &quot;Open the border!&quot; and shouted insults at the Hungarian special police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia&#39;s foreign minister has declared it &quot;unacceptable&quot; to send migrants back from Hungary as more and more migrants arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution to the problem, not collateral damage.
It is necessary to hold negotiations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days, &quot;Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after the 28-nation bloc failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share overall responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that in the future (next month or by the end of the year) an agreement will be reached whereby EU member states will host an additional 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded to convene an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis that has gripped the continent.
Hungary, however, does not hope for quick action from Brussels or its neighbors.
The state of emergency declared Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities more authority to act on the crisis, allowing them to block roads and expedite asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Siyjarto said his country is also planning to erect a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has completed the fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata said that even inmates were involved in urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main bottleneck and border crossing point of the European Union for displaced persons, many of whom are refugees - victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a more prosperous life, and not refugees - victims of hostilities who have the right to protection, and this point of view is sharply at odds with views of other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws that came into force in Hungary at midnight now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison sentences for those accused of human trafficking.
&quot;Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,&quot; government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have been observing heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban&#39;s national security adviser, reported that the authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border at the border itself, and another 15 people inside the country.
They crossed the border, breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly rebuilding the fence.
Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia, driving a railroad car wrapped in barbed wire to block one of the passages.
Riots erupted at the main border passage near the town of Rjoske, Hungary, as the Hungarians set up an office space for people to pass inside a metal container and crowds of people crushed each other to break through.
About 20 people managed to get inside, while thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road from Serbia to Hungary and announced they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton&#39;s edge over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among Democratic primary voters (down 58 percent), while Sanders comes in second with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he intends to run for the presidency, is getting the support of 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary rivalry, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on a candidate to support.
Clinton&#39;s supporters are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support from some demographics, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton retains a large lead among women and moderates, but that lead has declined.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, with Sanders just 5 points behind her.
The preference given to Clinton by Democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and she and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a big lead among older voters.
Clinton overtook Sanders by a double-digit number among Liberals last month, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in that group.
Nearly half of Democratic primary voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party&#39;s nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support her.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton&#39;s current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, views are more controversial - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked openly why they want her to be a candidate, the most popular response is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that it’s time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she’s the best candidate for the post. (10 percent).
Clinton&#39;s supporters also talk about an association linking her with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also called agree on issues and chances of being elected.
As the vice president ponders potential participation in the election, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to join the race - although a third think he shouldn&#39;t.
When asked who they would like to see in the second place among the candidates from the party, the Democratic primary voters in most cases name Biden.
More than half of Clinton&#39;s supporters say they would choose Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton&#39;s lead over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure is down from 78 percent last month.
On this indicator, Biden is far behind in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, when asked what is most important in a candidate, Democratic voters choose other options beyond their chances of being elected.
Similar to last month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates are unacceptable nominees for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, performed well on some key characteristics among their party&#39;s primary voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden is the leader in integrity of the three, and Clinton&#39;s strength lies in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters do not see Clinton as honest and trustworthy, twice as many who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no definite opinion about him.
Democratic primary voters also generally see the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as similar.
By all these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton&#39;s personal email account and server during her tenure as Secretary of State continue, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this has not negatively affected their overall opinion of her.
But that&#39;s a very different story for the American public at large.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion about this was divided back in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say the email controversy has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton in any way, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has worsened.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10, who claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party&#39;s voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, eight points down from last month, and 15 compared to May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not find her honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, receive good leadership grades.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush perform best in fairness.
Most see Sanders as more of an honest man than not, but as of Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS / New York Times poll
These two candidates scored half of the popular vote in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of a foothold.
Republican voters across the country continue to massively support Trump, who rose from 23% in a recent CBS poll ahead of the Fox News debate last month to 27% in Tuesday&#39;s poll.
But Carson skyrocketed over the same period from 6% to 23%.
The poll also showed that Carson enjoys support across all demographics, pushing Trump out of the group of college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, pulled back with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio together ranked third with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this newest poll is plus or minus 6%, the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN / ORC poll released last week showed Carson&#39;s growth in polls - showing 19% support among Republicans, followed by Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News / Washington Post poll also showed Trump to be significantly ahead of Carson.
With support for Carson rising in the past week, Trump made several critical attacks on the former neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump&#39;s faith.
&quot;We need energy,&quot; Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the Iowa campaign.
Five fraternity members accused of death of Baruch college freshman
About two years after the death of a college student during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
&quot;Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity of New York&#39;s Baruch College brutally attacked Chan&quot; Michael &quot;Deng during an initiation ceremony in September 2013 and did not take him to hospital on time, leading to his death,&quot; police said.
Officials say the blindfolded student with a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed several times as he tried to reach his goal by walking on slippery surfaces.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 when Deng passed out, and waited for an alleged hour before being taken to the hospital, police say.
They did, however, take the time to change Deng&#39;s clothes, Google for his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity&#39;s national president, for advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
&quot;At this point, the fraternity began to hide personal belongings, essentially putting the well-being of the brotherhood over the health of Michael Deng,&quot; said Chief Wagner.
They could not save him, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered several blunt injuries to his head, torso and hips.
“Too many families have been affected by initiation rituals, as at least one student has died during them every year since 1970,” Douglas Fayerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step on the part of the authorities is very important.
The Monroe County jury tilted in favor of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will face charges of rookie abuse and conspiracy.
&quot;We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned all this, officially or unofficially, then it,&quot; Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the nationwide fraternity removed the local branch from its structure.
What Happens When the Federal Reserve Raises Interest Rates
There will be a rise in rates, and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don&#39;t know is how long it will take before the onset, and how long it will last.
For the economy specifically, history explains little about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and a whopping 86 months.
The Fed&#39;s rigidity in raising rates often, though not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
This is why the US central bank administration is so emphatic that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates, but on how long it will take to adapt.
Indeed, there are many variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss about rate hikes is exaggerated.
&quot;The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve since the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the &#39;cheap money&#39; era,&quot; Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics, said in a comment to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal, but still low levels will be the seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here&#39;s a look at how some areas of the economy might have responded based on historical trends:
As the market has already seen over the past month or so, the anticipation of a rate hike could lead to volatility for a while.
With a rate hike, however, the consequences are usually less dramatic.
&quot;Equity earnings do not appear to have slowed 12-24 months after the first jump, which again likely reflects a delay in monetary policy,&quot; Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the results of the Federal Reserve rate hike.
More specifically, the market has changed dramatically over the past 35 years or so — about 14 percent — toward higher rates, remains fairly flat for 250 days thereafter (an average rise of 2.6 percent), then returns to normal after 500 days. reported an average return of 14.4 percent over the past six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron&#39;s.
Deutsche says that the outcome for securities tends not to become more pronounced immediately during the rate hike phase, and stock returns begin to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes are often fueled by them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in an environment that did not exist before and could precipitate a recession.
Basically, gross domestic product will be near its lowest point since the increased rate.
In 118 rate hikes since 1950, Deutsche Bank says, only twice-nominal annual GDP has been below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will be long lasting, with only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Rising rates amid such an unstable economic backdrop can be risky and raises the question &quot;will this time be different,&quot; Deutsche said.
Market participants are gearing up for a rate hike by the Federal Reserve all year, with their eyes fixed on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting that ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could have approved a rate hike at this meeting, futures trading is only a 25 percent chance.
“In our study, since 1950, all rate hike cycles to date have been in a supercycle of increasing leverage, with GDP surpassing pre-recession peaks very quickly after the recovery began,” the report said.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle so far is the longest the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, in total it has lasted 74 months and has not ended yet.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market is awaiting rate hikes, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds the effect will come faster than for stocks when the Federal system changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it looks like the yield reverses the vector immediately after the first rate hike / cut in the cycle.
At the end of the rate-hike cycle, bond yields fall immediately, &quot;Deutsche said.
Strategists at Charles Schwab believe the rate hike will push long-term and short-term bond yields closer, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in this climate, although &quot;we still fear fluctuations in yield,&quot; says Katie Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab, in the study.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adjusted to the expected outcomes of the Federal system&#39;s policies.
&quot;In addition to the strengthening dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,&quot; she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve has been flatter, credit spreads have widened, volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market with the tightening of Federal policy.
Generally speaking, companies doing their main business in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will find themselves in a worse position, as the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space, and their debt is more expensive financially.
&quot;History has shown that &#39;quality&#39; stocks performed above market performance for three months after the initial rate hike,&quot; Goldman Sachs analysts said in a client report.
The financially stable companies outperformed the uncertain companies in each rate hike in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on equity as well as low volatility stocks also performed better than low quality stocks, on average by 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become a big issue.
Companies with high interest rate floating rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange deals, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Investors could see profit through higher returns as well, although experts differ on how quickly this will happen.
&quot;BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM,&quot; says Conservative MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized station for &quot;lowering standards&quot;
Proves that it is becoming less and less distinguishable from a commercial competitor
Also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying the award was just ripped off the Brits
Parliamentarian Damien Collins, who lashed out at The Voice with similar criticism, was not original
&quot;BBC Radio 3 is becoming Classic FM,&quot; the MP leader said, urging the broadcaster to prove it does something that commercial companies don&#39;t.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC officials that the public radio station seemed to be &quot;growing dumb&quot; and becoming less and less distinguishable from its commercial rival.
&quot;Radio 3 looks like - I don&#39;t like using the word &#39;simplification&#39; - but it seems like it&#39;s turning into Classic FM,&quot; he said.
He&#39;s also set his sights on the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last year, looks like The Brits with a different name.
So if you are trying to do something different, here are two examples that first came to my mind, in which you are really just copying what is already on the market, &quot;said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC CEO denied the accusations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don&#39;t learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to performing live and making music really doesn&#39;t match anyone else&#39;s.
&quot;It is also really very important, I think, that Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and promoting new works,&quot; he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that the radio station has to work much harder to attract audiences than in the past, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC brainchild to come under attack for stepping on the heels of commercial competitors during hearings by a special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of £ 22 million.
See why this program is often discussed due to the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims the BBC 1 show, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was done in &quot;typical BBC style.&quot;
He added that he wants the Corporation to &quot;find a hit in its own home stable&quot; the next time it launches an entertainment project.
However, he does not see fit to discourage the ordering of new seasons of The Voice in the future, or the use of license fee money for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales growth slowed down as much as possible in August, and Black Friday may be the culprit.
Online sales increased by seven percent in the first three months of 2015
Last month saw its slowest growth since it was first watched in 2000
Online sales kicked off three years ago with the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts Convinced November Black Friday Could Help Conserve Spending
For about ten years now, virtual shopping has been booming, transforming many of Britain&#39;s main streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs of an alignment in online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Overall spending on online shopping in August showed the smallest increase since it was recorded in 2000, rising by only five percent.
Experts say there are now signs of a leveling off in online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
&quot;If you look at the rate of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there was always a reasonable explanation,&quot; Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales picked up three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to shop.
This meant that even more people were able to shop online, and that they could do it in any environment, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it is plateauing and you can see a decline (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers may have refrained from shopping ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, shoppers five times the average rushed to their computers to take advantage of great deals, bringing down a number of seller websites.
Experts believe Black Friday, when shoppers get into a bargaining battle, could have made people shy away from shopping.
Just over £ 1 out of every £ 5 is spent online, according to a study published by the British Retail Consortium.
In the case of goods such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more willingly than in fashion stores on the main streets.
Muslims bury those killed in the fall of a crane in Mecca, and sanctions imposed on bin Laden&#39;s family
Muslims carry bodies of 29 dead through streets as first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia blamed construction giant Saudi Binladin Group in part for the accident.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims flocked to the streets from everywhere to bury 29 of the victims killed in the collapse of a crane on Mecca&#39;s main mosque.
Dressed mostly in white, those attending the funeral flooded the road to pay tribute to the first of the dead to make their final journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed the sacred site where, just a few days earlier, a construction crane had smashed through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were handed over for burial, and at the same time, the Saudi king fined a construction company owned by the Bin Laden family for an accident that also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 parishioners killed in the collapse of a crane in the Main Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was Kasim Akram, a father of four from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage trip when a crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Main Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman announced today that the Binladin Group should not have left the boom raised when the crane was not working.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state agency Saudi Press, says the Binladin Group is partially responsible for the collapse.
The English editorial staff of the news agency did not disclose this detail, but reported that the company&#39;s leaders were forbidden to travel outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to investigate the cause of the crane falling into the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go on Hajj this month.
The Binladin Group did not make any announcements about the crane collapse, and representatives were unavailable for comment.
Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inadequate coordination with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca as part of the massive construction work being carried out by the Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been one of the closest associates of the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is leading the largest construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a traitorous son whom the family disowned in the 1990s.
The accident occurred with strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials ordered the payment of one million riyals (about £ 174,000) to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount to those who were irreversibly crippled.
The rest of the victims will receive half of this amount.
The head of B&amp;Q claims the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European craftsmen working for little money.
According to Veronique Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result - the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for specialists
Simultaneously Kingfisher closes 60 B&amp;Q stores nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to put hammers and paint brushes aside and instead hire skilled Eastern Europeans to do the housework.
If you know how to handle a hammer or paint a wall, you seem to be in the minority these days.
Because, according to the owner of B&amp;Q, the British are increasingly hiring craftsmen to do simple housework.
Veronique Laurie, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a home improvement services network, said the trend is driven by a significant influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open an additional 200 Screwfix shops specializing in handicrafts, while closing 60 B&amp;Q warehouses at the same time.
Ms. Laurie said that she would like to see more women in the staff of B&amp;Q stores, since eight out of ten decisions about purchases in the store are made by the fairer sex.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to her, one cannot fail to notice the latest demographic trends, characterized by the fact that the number of households consisting of single women is growing, who are more engaged in arranging their homes than in the past.
Ms. Laurie said: “Our stores are still predominantly male.
Steps must be taken to strike a balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women, and 80 percent of decisions on purchased goods are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laurie, one of five women at the helm of the UK&#39;s top companies listed on the FTSE100, has also changed the composition of the top management team to achieve an equal number of male and female directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of the executives are women, including the CEO and CFO.
Ms. Laurie said: “It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women on the board of directors was not difficult.
After the group took on the cost of closing stores, Kingfisher saw a decline in profit and sales in six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the Screwfix and B&amp;Q brands, opens 200 new stores.
Time to Decide on the US Federal Reserve Interest Rate
The world is watching the meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which for two days discusses the adoption of the most important decision - whether or not to raise the interest rate for the first time in a decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists found that just over half of those who thought the Fed would do it last week now believe it will wait a little longer and keep rates at the current 0-0.25 percent range. ...
This is a historic event as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve dropped the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero and begin the process of normalizing interest rates, &quot;said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is performing well, the economic recovery is adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned the markets to prepare for the change, but everything speaks to their confidence that all odds are against such a step.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees go to the EU via Croatia.
&quot;Open up!&quot; - chanting hundreds of refugees at the Khorgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for displaced persons.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to probe other options for routes to the European Union.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
Another - via Croatia and Slovenia - to Austria.
According to some reports, buses that carried refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the town of Shida on the Croatian border.
The drivers were instructed by the authorities to proceed without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovic assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its options are limited:
Our job is to keep Serbia as safe as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, to ensure that they are treated humanely.
But this is already a common European problem.
It is not easy to solve, no country in Europe alone can cope with this, and even more so a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is adamant:
If someone calls himself a refugee, in Serbia he must fill out the necessary documents.
And if he does not do this, then they will not let him into our country, because it is quite safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to erect the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: &quot;Europe wants to help us.&quot;
Vangelis Meimarakis has been a member of the center-right governments for a number of years, which, according to the left, led the country to a financial crisis.
Now, having become the interim leader of the New Democracy Party, he is challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with an Euronews journalist.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat to the SYRIZA coalition, but now, judging by the polls, the New Democracy has caught up with it in popularity.
What has changed during this time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and growth prospects.
Now the country again has a budget deficit and a high unemployment rate.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras drove them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what was promised with what actually happened.
Everyday life has become noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation improved, and this was the case for the majority of Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the elections, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The fact is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programs were in force or are still operating, political forces and all ruling parties came together in order to implement the program on which they reached agreement, without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favor of an agreement between Mr Tsipras and the country&#39;s creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted for the movement of Greece along the European path, because we are well aware of the disastrous consequences of the country&#39;s exit from the EU.
Now Europe is helping us by giving subsidies to our farmers for their produce, we have solidarity funds, a Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would be lost if there was no agreement with Europe.
But the current austerity measures are the result of the way Mr Tsipras negotiated.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government wants to restore order during the first year in power, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then, I am sure, all the commitments made that are not can be fulfilled due to the fact that they lead to a recession, can be negotiated again, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to believe that already in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, since they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their confidence, we must continue the privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed, while continuing to reap the benefits of EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found out when discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example related to the income of farmers.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the ministers of Tsipras never spoke about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and poorly informed, and therefore unsuccessfully negotiated and concluded an unsuccessful agreement.
Euronews: If you win the elections, you will soon find yourself at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them differ from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014 we tried to best implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners in it.
We pushed reforms forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price the Greek government was happy with.
At that time I was the speaker of the parliament, I managed to agree on the opinions of three parliamentary groups, which then constituted the government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, and this was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations that took place outside.
And we managed to bring the country back to a normal situation that would have continued to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: There has been a massive influx of refugees across Greece in recent weeks.
What do you think about this situation and about the reaction of the European countries to which these people are striving?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a ticking time bomb that we have to deal with after winning the elections.
And the reason is that the SYRIZA government did not act as it should in this situation.
In such matters, you should act proactively, because if a problem catches up with you, then only emergency measures remain.
And now we are in just such a situation.
Even the interim government, which replaced SYRIZA, did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions by the interim government, which is being rendered valuable assistance by the president of the republic, who has called for an EU summit, will make it possible to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note - refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They are victims of the war in Syria, victims of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
There is a deeply humanitarian aspect to this issue, and we will stick to the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
An appropriate decision must be made at the EU summit, and the United Nations must also be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and refugee reception centers.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, thanks for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkovka, Donetsk region, during the day, officers of the criminal investigation department of the Main Directorate of Militia of the region, together with military counterintelligence, identified and detained a suspect, who turned out to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian serviceman from the city of Krivoy Rog (Dnipropetrovsk region), who the night before while sharing alcohol , and the conflict that arose in the village of Verkhnetoretskiy, Yasinovatskiy district, Donetsk region, fired a machine gun at his opponent.
The 22-year-old boy was reported to have been wounded from the hospital, where he was hospitalized with perforating gunshot wounds to his legs.
As Artem Vasitsky, deputy head of the criminal investigation department of the regional police headquarters, said, during the operational actions, law enforcement officers proved the involvement of the person involved in another serious criminal offense - the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The detectives established that on the same day a conflict took place between the suspect and another local resident, as a result of which he inflicted a fatal gunshot wound to the man&#39;s head.
The investigative department of the Druzhkovsky GO has opened criminal proceedings under the articles &quot;Intentional Murder&quot; and &quot;Intentional Infliction of Grievous Bodily Injury&quot; of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces up to 15 years in prison.
The defendant was detained and placed in a temporary detention center, according to the press service of the Donetsk region police.
Two residents of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments in the colors of the Ukrainian flag, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, have been sentenced to imprisonment by a Russian court.
Two more residents of the city were sentenced to restraint of freedom.
Residents of Novosibirsk who received prison sentences were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicts received restrictions on freedom for 14 and 18 months.
The Leninsky Court of Novosibirsk found four townspeople guilty of vandalism against the monuments to Lenin, which were located on the territory of the regional committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and on Tricotazhnaya Street, as well as the memorial complex &quot;Monument of Glory&quot;.
In the latter case, the Katyusha rocket launcher and the T-34 tank were painted.
We will remind, on the night of December 12, in the Russian Novosibirsk, unknown persons painted military equipment in the colors of the Ukrainian flag on the Monument of Glory.
The common-law wife of the popular Russian actor Yevgeny Tsyganov, Irina Leonova, gave birth to her seventh child.
The girl was born in one of the Moscow clinics.
The newborn and her mother are doing well.
We will remind, recently Tsyganov and Leonova broke up.
Eugene refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambitions for everything.
Evgeny Tsyganov is 36 years old.
He is an actor in the Moscow theater &quot;Workshop Pyotr Fomenko&quot;.
Known for the films &quot;Walk&quot;, &quot;Space as a Presentiment&quot;, &quot;Brest Fortress&quot;, TV series &quot;Thaw&quot; and &quot;Fartsa&quot;.
On September 8, Evgeny Tsyganov was named &quot;Actor of the Year&quot; and &quot;Person of the Year&quot; by the Russian version of the popular GQ magazine.
The man who opened the shooting at Delta State University left a note of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was &quot;sorry&quot; about the first murder and would like to &quot; return everything back, &quot;the authorities said on Tuesday.
Police in Gauthier, Mississippi say a professor of geography and social studies at Delta State University called 911 at around 10 a.m.
on Monday and reported that he had shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his home.
He said, &quot;I killed my wife last night,&quot; and also mentioned that there is a &quot;doggie&quot; in the house that &quot;won&#39;t touch anyone,&quot; but is probably upset.
The police inquired about the name of the caller, but he did not name him.
Lamb did not explain why he opened fire.
Arriving at the crime scene, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said, “I&#39;m sorry I would like to get everything back.
I loved Amy and she is the only one who has ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, and committed suicide when he was surrounded by police on Monday night.
University rector William La Forge said that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but &quot;Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind.&quot;
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb was suggesting an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services on Tuesday said there was &quot;no information or evidence&quot; of a &quot;love triangle.&quot;
About Prentiss was described as a &quot;good person&quot; by Sean O&#39;Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O&#39;Steen revealed that he and Prentiss have a daughter, who is 19, and that she is &quot;inconsolable.&quot;
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were &quot;best friends.&quot;
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the Sun Herald calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home over the Internet.
Knowles revealed that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning and that she dated Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, &quot;She always wanted to help people.&quot;
Police said Lamb at some point on Monday called his relatives to say that &quot;he will not go to jail.&quot;
On the evening of the same day, when the police overtook him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
Lamb earned his Ph.D. in Education from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to a resume posted on the university website.
Stars who have lost their luck
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has gone through several difficult years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime life partner Farrah Fawcett, who died of cancer.
The actor reportedly also suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All this certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United dropped out for months with double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about the fact that he will not be able to enter the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno&#39;s reckless tackle in the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Shaw burst into the PSV penalty area.
He was treated in the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, &quot;He has a double fracture and is in the hospital.&quot;
He will be transported to Manchester tomorrow or a day later, and then he will be operated on.
It&#39;s terrible - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and started to play fantastic, and then it happened.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He cried.
I&#39;m not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture it&#39;s six months and the guy won&#39;t be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and was not awarded a penalty.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes that the Italian referee made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it is worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad two-legged tackle.
On his Twitter account, Shaw writes: &quot;Thank you all for your messages, words cannot describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will be back even stronger than I was.&quot;

The English defender will have additional incentive to get better for the European Championships in France next June.
Phillip Koku, coach of PSV, said: &quot;This is a very bad injury.&quot;
When any player is eliminated with a similar injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while playing for Mexico against Van Gaal&#39;s Dutch team at the 2014 World Cup.
&quot;It is very difficult for him now, because he had no intention of hurting the opponent, and when you hear that this is a very serious injury, you feel unwell,&quot; Koku said.
I was not able to see the moment itself.
The only thing I could see was the ball flying in a different direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched it, but I didn&#39;t see Luke roll.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it is, I know how difficult it is to bear.
It’s very hard for me and I’m very sorry.
Andres Guardado of PSV was also rushed to the hospital after a confrontation with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorax?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: if your child liked a book, it will take a little time before you know it almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you&#39;re David Cameron.
When asked about his favorite children&#39;s book by a company that organizes children&#39;s vacations during the holidays, the prime minister chose Lorax, an ecological fairy tale written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a tough choice, Cameron wrote in a comment posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: “I love reading this funny, touching, unusual story with a strong message to my kids because there is always an image or message in it that we&#39;re missing. &quot;
And everything would be fine, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to retell the contents of the book, but in fact tells the plot of the film of the same name, filmed in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original narration.
&quot;In the city of Allnuzhville, surrounded by high walls, where there was no greenery and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of her dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree,&quot; we read in the text a description of the love story unknown to Dr. Seuss (real name Theodore Seuss Geisel), who died in 1991.
If that sounds suspicious enough, Cameron&#39;s text reads almost like a summary of the Lorax plot posted on the Internet Movie Database: &quot;In the high-walled city of Allnuzhville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes win the heart of Audrey - the girl of her dreams. &quot;
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being an admittedly active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of the book, in which an unnamed boy learns about the destruction of the environment by the greedy tree cutter and knitter of &quot;all the goodies&quot; Nakhodkins, despite Lorax&#39;s protests (whose name appears in the title of the book) - a funny creature with a mustache who &quot;speaks for the trees.&quot;
Most likely, such a simple PR task was assigned to a performer who had never read a book about Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text allegedly came from Cameron&#39;s office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was sourced from Cameron&#39;s headquarters, but no further comments were forthcoming.
There was clearly a risk of missing England for Adam Leet, but it&#39;s still a tricky one.
Beating Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but looking at the team that England has selected for this tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test run defeat that happened last time does not seem likely to me.
I would also not rule out a victory at home.
Alistair Cook&#39;s team may be less experienced than the one they were three years ago, but they have hitters with masterful spinners and the collective mind is strong; they will not bring with them the scars from 2012, but only a youthful positive.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into a spinner bowler, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
More on the subject: Adam Leat is eliminated from England Test Cricket Team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to expel Adam Leith is, of course, difficult for me, his head coach at Yorkshire, to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality is that cricketers are judged by score.
There were no questions about John Root, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I have said this before) players are best chosen by themselves.
A couple of fifty, and Lita could wait for a longer career, but he was at the mercy of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he scores more wounds for the Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss spoke well of his attitude even when he didn’t show what he was capable of, which doesn’t surprise me; he is first of all a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before a test cricket batsman makes an impression is a difficult question.
Leat played in seven games, as did Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton in nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play on his own and on a foreign field.
Your only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lee was in top shape, but that lost opportunity is a thing of the past.
Alex Hales shows up, and he&#39;s a batsman that I rate highly.
He&#39;s an unpredictable cricketer, which is what we saw at the Yorkshire club earlier this season, when he earned 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those who came before him, but this will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would make it possible to introduce an additional spinner, keeping the four speed bowlers, is being pondered, and I&#39;m not at all against it.
I see no reason why the batter can&#39;t hit the ball there, and this left-hander has already shown that he is a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what he needs for his county of Worcestershire, but he became the third number for them, and there is not much difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches as &quot;third batsman&quot; before stepping out as opener in 2001.
He immediately won three hundred and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the national team as a reserve spinner, and during my short communication with him he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People might look at his approximate stats - 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball on average - and think that this is a risky bet, but among the spinners, there are not many votes, and the selectors chose youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
Appointing Mahela Jayawordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a test match advisor could have been a masterful move.
He is one of the best guys for the game, bringing a wealth of experience to the game from all possible conditions and attacks.
Paul Collingwood gets involved in white ball games and will provide both energy and a ruthless pace to the setup.
I have always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, be it game or coaching, and, like Mahela, has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if they say what has already been said before, can give new strength to the team.
Collie&#39;s Durham teammate Ben Stokes is left for one-day, Ruth has been given a similar break due to Australia, and I, for one, have no problem.
While not everyone will agree, coaches and player selectors do not set the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
UK exit camp could win if economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron&#39;s ill-conceived policy to reopen talks on keeping Britain in the EU is getting more and more difficult every day, even without looking at the election of the genius Jeremy - &quot;Is it yes or no?&quot; - Corbyn as the leader of the Labor Party or the TUC&#39;s indignation over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigels Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that in the current position of the EU, which is experiencing a variety of crises - not all of them made of its own - some member states are fed up with the British self-centered agenda of divisive concessions and agreement-undermining changes that they mostly do not want to.
Gathering in Brighton for its annual meeting, the TUC decided that he didn’t want them anyway if they were destroying social protection.
We might even call it &quot;Dave &amp; George&#39;s Selfie Program.&quot;
The prime minister and finance minister ride summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take pictures of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without a local celebrity, then come home and say they are recruiting allies for reform.
It&#39;s all about me.
A European friend of mine who wants a UK interested in maintaining external contacts under the EU tent - &quot;Don&#39;t leave us with France,&quot; Berlin says - suggests that blinkered ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they don&#39;t care, we&#39;ll stay we or we will leave.
Angela Merkel, the very cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation worsens for her, as it worsened for the stuck-in-place Thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14) and Kolya (16).
French President François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
It also loses its power.
Poland may soon get a nationalist government of the right, Spain - of the left.
It&#39;s hard to see them go out of their way to help the selfie-brits whose energies could have been spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - which they don&#39;t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even be planning to issue deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to spur the UK&#39;s exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
&quot;The overhaul was a fix,&quot; and &quot;Britain got nothing of value from the renewed negotiations.&quot;
Europeans, unfortunately, know what a predator Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical the media moguls are about the EU, in contrast to the referendum launched by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our accession in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the hardened Euro-opportunist who became famous for his &quot;EU straight bananas&quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
For all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a motley bunch of tax-fearing crooks, outsider telephone hackers and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had exactly the same opinion of them, but realized that when you are in a cage with a violent gorilla, you should give her bananas to distract her and prevent her from eating you for lunch and again. with tea.
In fact, Milliband was more of a Blair supporter than Blair himself in opposing Cameron&#39;s idea of a referendum, as Blair sacrificed principles in favor of an abolished EU constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who gave him the winning ticket.
The press did not forgive him any of this.
But sweetheart Jeremy Corbin, who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer had time to spend on me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock&#39;s&#39; 80s boycott Murdoch strategy - a mistake both then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a coherent strategy for dealing with the press - not with me, but definitely with Andrew Marr, on whose BBC couch he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn&#39;s official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside of the traditionalist Ukip tendency and the broader &quot;Little England&quot; Tories can probably say yes to this.
This is the same as Hilary - &quot;Benn, but not Bennit&quot; - Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his inner Boy Scout struggling to admit that Corbyn&#39;s appointment of obnoxious John McDonnell as &quot;shadow&quot; Treasury Secretary was bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father struggled on TV for disloyalty to his fellow Labor cabinetmates without going too far or losing his cabinet post.
Hillary&#39;s battle was more engaging.
But the struggle to stay &quot;under any circumstance&quot; - Benn&#39;s line - is not what McDonnell said, nor what JK said to peers and MPs in private Monday night, by all accounts.
Whatever the Democrat and &quot;his boyfriend&quot; Corbin wants to report - remember, he even touched me - the discipline of messaging remains important in the age of 24/7 television, and especially in the maelstrom of social media, hotbeds of paranoia and betrayal.
It makes sense not to let Cameron get rid of Europe so easily by letting him take for granted Labor&#39;s support during the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn&#39;s underlying misconception about EU membership - in the Bennite fortress economy - is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among leftist dissidents, for whom narcissism, engendered by minor difference, is central to dogmatic debate.
As for his misconceptions about NATO, Tom Watson is unshakable that J.K. will not campaign for an exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on concessions to Britain when it all might be pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the weak British military action in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even as the Tory government in power is cutting spending, as I was reminded of this Monday during lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize Public Health England&#39;s e-cigarette review
The government-funded agency&#39;s claims that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are associated with the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts publishing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in conjunction with the Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its e-cigarette report.
PHE released an important milestone report last month, calling it a &quot;comprehensive review of the evidence.&quot;
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized the &quot;extremely shaky rationale&quot; behind which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers questioned whether these claims were &quot;firm or fragile.&quot;
Martin McKee, Lecturer in European Health Organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Lecturer in Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: &quot;The fundamental principle of public health is that rules must be based on evidence of effectiveness.&quot;
The public expects PHE&#39;s claims that &quot;the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking&quot; were based on detailed evidence and modeling, they said.
In fact, this is inferred from a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multicriteria decision analysis model to summarize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell said the meeting was co-sponsored by a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also confirmed the BAT certifications in healthcare in the sustainability report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette maker, without mentioning the funding it reportedly received earlier from the Philip Morris tobacco company.
No reasonable explanation has been provided for the choice of board members, but there are several prominent e-cigarette proponents among them, some of whom have also announced industry funding in the publication.
It is not known if other participants in the meeting have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco business at PHE.
A research paper published by the group &quot;gracefully agrees&quot; that there is a lack of &quot;strong evidence of harmful effects of most foods by most criteria,&quot; wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links and limitations were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE&#39;s claims that &quot;there is currently no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, causing children or non-smokers to smoke&quot; are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Wellness at PHE, said the BMJ&#39;s claims have been answered in the past.
He said: &quot;Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.&quot;
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All evidence implies that the health threats from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what does not, especially where the public had doubts about the relative hazard versus tobacco.
Around 80,000 people die a year from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS £ 2bn a year.
By clearly stating the obvious - that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they do only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our mission to the nation.
Former Channel 4 CEO: BBC Should End EastEnders
Former Channel 4 head Luke Johnson says the BBC should stop producing programs like EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would give a lot for successful shows like the Albert Square soap opera.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used to create programs that are not produced by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public service broadcasts, which are likely to be watched by only a small portion of the audience, at peak airtime, when competitors have high-rated shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the corporation would like to do more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had tried unsuccessfully for six years to establish a partnership with the BBC while working on Channel 4.
“I can&#39;t help but think that the BBC is preparing to launch and airing programs that could be shown by competing companies that do not receive subsidies,” Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee members as part of clarifying the future of the BBC.
If you keep the license fee, which I do not think is a good solution in the medium to long term, then the company should only keep programs on the air that are not being released or intend to be released by other companies.
The Voice show is airing in the prime slot because the creators want the best possible support for the future.
The idea of no one else showing it is laughable and obviously absurd.
Johnson: “I don&#39;t understand why regressive taxes should go to fund broadcasts that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is common knowledge that they are of our own production.
Other channels would undoubtedly give a lot for it.
I don&#39;t understand how this could be public service broadcasting.
I don&#39;t think that would belittle the BBC in any way.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings &quot;because of the ambition of the staff and their belief that this is the best way to get long-term support.&quot;
His comments on the most watched shows on the BBC echo those of Sky CEO Tony Ball, who, in his McTaggart Memorial Lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, suggested that the BBC sell series like EastEnders.
Johnson noted that more niche BBC broadcasts of a public nature &quot;continue to go to BBC4, where audiences often cannot be assessed, but the company&#39;s function is fulfilled, and this can be used as an argument in sanctimonious preaching justifying £ 4bn in licensing fees. : &quot;Well, yes, of course, we do all these incomprehensible programs that no one watches.&quot;
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
Johnson told the committee about the licensing fee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the most out of it.
Sure, you all think, we all think £ 150 a year is a huge amount, but for people for whom £ 150 is a lot of money, I wonder if they think so because they don&#39;t really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive director David Elstein, who also spoke to the committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should rethink Rita&#39;s mission in favor of &quot;inform, educate and entertain.&quot;
He noted that only a small fraction of the BBC&#39;s content is now formally classified as educational - 1% television content and 0.1% radio content - and that the company should take up the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto &quot;inform, educate and entertain. &quot;
On partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as &quot;Promenade concerts&quot; (only a fraction of them, he said, are shown on TV), as well as enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available to viewing online.
&quot;Sonogenetics&quot; allows you to control brain cells using sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change direction of movement when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using pulses of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are exposed to pulses of sound that are too high for the human ear to hear.
The impulses work by activating genetically engineered neurons to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Researchers Use Light to Control Brain Activity
Scientists said that the worms demonstrate the capabilities of a new technique called &quot;sonogenetics&quot;, the essence of which is to use ultrasound to excite certain cells in the brain, heart and muscles, while the ultrasound source is located outside the body.
Shrikant Chalasani, a research associate at the Salk Institute, La Jolla, Calif., Told the Guardian that the technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses to a person&#39;s brain and is used to treat Parkinson&#39;s disease.
Nematode worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplified ultrasonic waves, which then penetrated the worms&#39; bodies.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called &quot;TRP-4 ion channels&quot; found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the application of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and introduced into worm organisms, activating the modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to that used in &quot;optogenetics&quot; - a new direction that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using pulses of light.
Chalasani argues that sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the desired area of the brain through optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass unhindered through the tissues of the body, so they do not need to pass inside the cranium to deliver them.
&quot;We believe that for the treatment of certain neurological diseases in a clinical setting, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can temporarily make human neurons sensitive to ultrasound signals,&quot; Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertisements mock the UK arms trade
Watch Amnesty International&#39;s video protesting the arms exhibition.
Awesome assassin drones!
Shin-crushing iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light and noise batons, causing unbearable pain, but leaving no marks!
A sprightly voice and hand-drawn animation leave no doubt that this ad for the world&#39;s largest arms exhibition is a caustic parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government&#39;s intention to &quot;push&quot; weapons to repressive regimes, using the defense technology and systems exhibition at ExCeL in Docklands security.

But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and on subway trains, which demand to look at them again.
&quot;An important announcement for the DLR from September 15th to 18th?&quot; - written on one of them in the fonts of the London Underground with the image of the DLR line turning into a silhouette of a tank.
This September, a mob of arms dealers will descend on the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help obstruct the exhibition of weapons.
The 300 posters were designed by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland Park.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them across London using a &quot;ad slot cracker kit,&quot; a 6 pound wrench set that claims to &quot;give access to about a third of the ad space at bus stops on the planet.&quot;
Transport workers in London are not happy with such &quot;vandalism&quot; in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the spoof ads issued by the Special Patrol Group.
Artists are becoming more demanding and strive to bring political art to audiences outside of galleries, according to Gavin Grindon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and lecturer at the University of Essex.
Many artists start working with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another anti-arms exhibition poster welcoming passengers on the subway.
Amnesty&#39;s video has been viewed over 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and produced by pro bono agency VCCP with a free graphic designer and voiceover.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence around the arms show - with a pass on the ExCel calendar - and thought, &quot;Let&#39;s give them the campaign they&#39;re trying to avoid.&quot;
They thought to create more realistic and dodgy corporate ads, but &quot;filling them with vibrant colors and animations at home was more exciting.&quot;
“They&#39;ve been incredibly helpful in bringing awareness to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the show,” says Amnesty&#39;s Tom Davis.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action to ensure that this torture equipment is not illegally sold right on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative armaments-themed art comes from within the ExCeL, where exhibitors trade fantastically euphemesic products.

Eight golden rules of student residence
It&#39;s already 11 years since I moved to the student dorm as a normal 19-year-old who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and numerous, long complaints about others ...
Basically, what I&#39;ve learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
Moving to a hostel can range from mildly nerve-racking to downright frightening.
It encourages chatting: telling people where you are from, if you took your sabbatical and where you spent it, if you support Corbin and why you &quot;honestly, neither love nor hate Marmite, because seriously guys, it&#39;s just yeast extract. HAHAHA, I&#39;ll be at my place. &quot;
Take a break.
And help others take a break too - ask questions and show interest.
It keeps the conversation going and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn&#39;t even talk to, even if your eyelashes lit up and they were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People&#39;s rooms are often turned into drinking establishments, midnight cinemas and hangouts, but they are also places where people dress and straighten their underwear.
More on the subject: Don&#39;t even think about starting university while in a relationship
Introverts are treated unfairly in universities.
Your room should be a sanctuary, but many dorms create a culture of wandering from one room to the next, which fosters friendship, communication, and long-lasting friendships.
It can be hell for someone trying to recuperate.
Nothing in culture allows you to say: &quot;I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I could restore the energy that I spent on communicating with you.&quot;
Try to feel when a fellow student is tired of communication - and not knock on him, but send an SMS.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
One guy in my dorm followed this principle: if the door was not locked, then he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Make friends with baked goods.
Since you start college life at the height of the Bake-Off show, knocking on people&#39;s doors to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate chip cookies is not such a strange act, not so much like the 1950s with their &quot;Welcome, we are neighbors , I baked you something, and now smile, and I will ask you personal questions. &quot;
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obligated to chat with you, and in the end, they will probably associate your face with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Poorly coalesced lumps of flour, sugar, and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Food theft is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, appropriating someone&#39;s chicken is stealing, but is it stealing to take a little milk for your tea?
Check with the owner of the milk.
Most likely, he will offer you not to be shy, even if you are seething with rage inside.
If someone steals your things, it&#39;s annoying, and I sympathize with you - but try to be more mature than my neighbor, who poured dishwashing liquid into her milk to get revenge on those who took it without asking.
She is now in jail.
You should not make noise that will disturb people from sleeping or studying.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the saying about glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked a neighbor to turn down the sound of the drum and bass guitar, since it was 3 in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor turned up the volume.
When he finally fell silent at 5 a.m., she graciously let him sleep for two hours, then turned on her music and locked the door behind her for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn&#39;t it be romantic if your future spouse settled in the same hostel as you?
On the contrary, it would not be extremely, until biting your elbows, awkwardly, if you took a neighbor for your future spouse, got carried away by him, broke off relations and had to see him every day, and perhaps watch how he pulls all your mutual friends?
Of course, you cannot order your heart - but if your hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to slightly cool your own ardor.
In that exhilarating moment when you realize that someone has left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between pranking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but turns into its opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never stain anyone&#39;s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone else&#39;s door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you will then put in the freezer - but do not glue other people&#39;s things with Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to Install a New Operating System on iPhone After Apple&#39;s Update Release
A new operating system can be requested from the Settings app, select General, and then Software Update.
If it&#39;s ready, your phone will let you download and install it.
Some have run into problems after installation when they get an error message telling them that &quot;Application update failed&quot;.
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait for the revival to subside or try to update via iTunes.
The phone prompts guide you through the entire process.
The process may include uninstalling apps to increase free space - but Apple minimized the chance of this by reducing the size of the update, and also made it easier to do it with a special utility that suggests uninstalling apps and reinstalling them after the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your phone is charged or is near the charger when performing the update to prevent the battery from draining.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as draining the phone in the process can cause the update to fail.

Washington responded to Russia&#39;s military activity with a phone call.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad only leads to an aggravation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about this with his Russian counterpart yet, writes PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia&#39;s military activity in Syria.
It is reported by PJ Media.
&quot;Secretary Kerry has made it clear that further Russian support for President Assad poses a risk of escalating and prolonging the conflict, as well as negatively affecting our common goal of fighting extremism, if we also do not continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power, &quot;- said representatives of the US State Department.
They also noted that Kerry reiterated the US commitment to fighting the Islamic State through a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be able to be a member of it.
In addition, the United States &quot;will be pleased with Russia&#39;s constructive role in its attempts to resist the Islamic State.&quot;
Last Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what actions Russian troops were taking in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, White House spokesman Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: “When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will raise handset and try to make the call. &quot;
Barack Obama himself considers Russia&#39;s decision to increase support for the Assad regime &quot;a losing bet.&quot;
I remember our conversation with Mr Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that it was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only make the situation worse.
&quot;But he did not heed my warnings - and as a result, the situation worsened,&quot; the US President said.
The imported yachts will be exempted from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating facilities for recreation and sports from customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the ministry on behalf of the government of the Russian Federation.
Yelena Lashkina, Assistant to the Minister of Economic Development, told Izvestia about this.
In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following a trip to Crimea, instructed a number of departments - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Customs Service, and Rosturizm - to prepare proposals on creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to store their ships abroad - about € 200 million annually go to the treasury of European states for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission &quot;On Amending the List of Goods Temporarily Imported with Full Conditional Exemption from Payment of Customs Duties and Taxes&quot;, providing for the provision of full conditional exemption from payment of customs duties and taxes in relation to imported yachts and other floating equipment for recreation and sports.
According to the ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, - said Lashkina.
This issue was submitted to the subcommittee on customs and tariff, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also approved by the departments following the discussion.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure for full conditional release upon import is inherently a privilege.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommittee in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will make a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EAEU member states, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempted from the payment of customs duties and taxes, includes goods necessary to facilitate foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for use in science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc. Among them - office equipment (personal computers, typewriters), instrumentation, drilling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and items for religious rituals.
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation told Izvestia that they had prepared mandatory decrees on the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Yevpatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for the entry and exit of small, sport sailing and pleasure boats at the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport instructed the captains of the seaports of the Crimea to ensure the application of a simplified procedure for the entry of small, sport sailing and pleasure ships into the seaport and the exit of the listed vessels from the seaport.
Also, the Ministry of Transport has prepared draft orders of the government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the boundaries of the water area of the seaports of Crimea.
Regarding Yalta and Feodosia, orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the stage of approval, the press service of the department noted.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol should carry out state supervision, classification and survey, state registration in relation to small vessels used for non-commercial purposes.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, there is a whole constantly developing industry, in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything stands still.
Our coast is of little interest, the only piece where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that in this area there are extremely strict rules of the border service: in order to go for a walk on a yacht, you need to issue a lot of permits.
Moreover, inside Russia, the yacht has nowhere to refuel.
For two days she can go with her own fuel, and then the problem arises of where to get it, - says Denis Novikov, Sales Director of Nordmarine.
As for the storage space for yachts, in Moscow and St. Petersburg there are now special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. Also, yachts are sent for storage to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are wealthy people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts has decreased.
The World Bank has allocated a loan of $ 500 million to Ukraine.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $ 500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
&quot;The new funding will support a number of priority banking sector reforms in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine,&quot; the statement said.
Qimiao Fan, World Bank Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, said banking sector reforms would help revive lending in the real economy and spur a recovery in economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank is seeing the first signs of stabilization.
But due to the severity of the problems, Fan calls on the Ukrainian government to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved a loan of € 100 million to Ukraine, RIA Novosti reports.
In prisons, they ask to create separate blocks for transgender people.
At the Public Council under the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicts in October 2015, among other issues, they will discuss the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender people and transvestites in colonies.
Council member Vladislav Grib told Izvestia about this.
In his opinion, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia who have not decided on their gender, it is possible to provide separate cells, blocks in domestic prisons, or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future, create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to determine citizens to serve their sentences in such isolated places only after the convicts undergo appropriate medical examinations, which prove that the offender is indeed a person who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that isolating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice is successfully operating abroad: in the pre-trial detention center (where the accused are held until the court&#39;s decision), there are separate cells for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special blocks.
Today, this is the only way out when dealing with such criminals.
They definitely need to be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgender people in ordinary cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for the FSIN officers.
The humiliation of trances by inmates is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big the city is, how many criminals with undetermined gender, you need to calculate where to distribute them.
Separate pre-trial detention centers are definitely not needed - only cells, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
As Grib explained, the block can hold 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps is created in Russia alone, then transsexual prisoners will be able to serve their sentences there from any region.
Citizens are held in a pre-trial detention center at the scene of the crime, therefore, the receipts of transvestites or transgender people from other subjects during the investigation and trial are unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, says Grib.
Recall that on the eve of the law enforcement officers could not decide in which pre-trial detention center - male or female - to determine the 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis) detained for drug possession, which is why the man with a girlish appearance was not arrested.
He was released home on recognizance not to leave.
This news was widely discussed on social networks and the media, since there really is no mechanism for keeping transgender people in pre-trial detention centers and colonies in Russia.
Russian human rights defender, activist of the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolai Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for serving sentences by transgender people, noting that it is also possible to define people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of ensuring security for homosexuals in prisons, says Alekseev.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be made in the name of this for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgender people.
At the same time, Alekseev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are ready to impersonate transsexuals in order to get into a colony different from ordinary ones.
Of course, it is possible to introduce a medical examination before placing people in colonies for transgender people, but everything is not always straightforward.
For example, in the United States, one of the Chelsea Manning inmates looked like a man, and already in prison said that he wanted to change his gender, ”Alekseev said.
A person can feel like anyone.
But as long as there are no separate places to serve sentences for transgender people, I doubt that the prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such people and delve into the intricacies of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, Boris Lordkipanidze, an international expert on reproductive health issues on the territory of the Russian Federation, noted that the introduction of a new distribution system for transsexual criminals in the colony could greatly delay the start of serving sentences by convicts.
A commission is being created - this is a question of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, this is not one test, on the basis of which a high-precision conclusion is made.
Today&#39;s possibilities of psychiatry allow it.
Therefore, before sex change, potential patients always undergo such examinations - they show exactly whether sex change with surgery is a necessary measure, says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to convicts, because on average such a survey takes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general he supported the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals, he also doubts that in the current economic conditions it would be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations - there are only a few transgender people in Russia.
It is difficult to count, there is no official statistics, but if we take into account that there are about 5% of homosexuals in Russia, then we can say that there are even fewer transgender people, and those who have such a deviation and also commit crimes are quite insignificant, ”Lordkipanidze said.
Now, at the request of the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgender people can receive separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the World Junior Chess Championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk, the world chess championship among juniors under 20 has come to an end.
The ending of the championship turned out to be more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and became the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who nevertheless managed to catch up with the Pole Jan-Krzysztof Dudu, who seemed to be confidently walking towards the title.
Ukrainian chess player Natalya Buksa celebrated the victory among girls.
The World Chess Championship, which took place in Khanty-Mansiysk since the beginning of September, seemed to have lost almost all the intrigue by the middle of the tournament distance, since the representative of Poland Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who issued a series of four victories (the competition is held according to the Swiss system in 13 rounds) , confidently seized the lead.
Considering that Duda was the rating favorite of the championship, and indeed he is considered one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood that he would miss the gained gap seemed very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to close the gap to just 0.5 points, he remained the clear favorite in the fight for the title.
After Antipov, in order to catch up with the leader, it was imperative to win in the 13th round.
But even that would not have helped if Duda had won his game.
Plus, this obligatory victory, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he had to wait for Duda to finish his game, who met with Benjamin Bock.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player drew the opposition with the Dutchman.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
That is why the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, whose governor Natalya Komarova traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded him the main prize.
But in the competition of girls, an intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalya Bukse (Ukraine) - to win the title, it was enough not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Buksa.
The Russian athlete remained second, 0.5 points behind the champion.
VimpelCom changes its regional structure.

Igor Artemyev, the head of the FAS, said that the department is against indexation by 10% of tariffs for cargo transportation and the provision of state subsidies, as requested by Russian Railways.
At first they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and also multibillion-dollar subsidies from the budget, he says. -
We say: this is wrong, this is too much, reduce your costs, learn to save money, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own, &quot;much stricter&quot; proposals, which are now being discussed in the government.

Ministry of Industry and Trade: Targeted Food Aid Will Not Become an Analogue of Cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Yevtukhov said that the program of targeted food aid will not become an analogue of the rationing system of food distribution that existed in the USSR.
We are talking about modern targeted food assistance to the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I ask you not to speculate on the phrase &quot;food card&quot;.
I would like to especially note that one should not confuse the offered grocery cards with an echo of the past times of total shortages, a card distribution system in which the amount of products received is normalized.
We have so far proposed a concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation, &quot;TASS quotes the words of Mr. Yevtukhov.
Earlier, Kommersant wrote that a program for the introduction of food ration cards for the poor has been submitted to the government.

This year the research of the Association of Russian Managers &quot;Top-1000 Russian Managers&quot; is published for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian top managers, the study summarizes the results of the work of Russian managers for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of last year&#39;s ranked laureates.
Last year&#39;s winners are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate in the current year&#39;s ranking and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the initial list of candidates is invited to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, which it would be advisable to add to the general pool of candidates.
The following heads of functional areas of the company may be nominated: CFO, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, HR Director, CIO, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Government Relations, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each manager nominated by the experts is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate his own management team and up to ten new leaders from other companies.
Candidates are nominated on a sectoral basis based on the sectoral classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and timber processing industry, mechanical engineering, media business, metallurgy, diversified holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to enter the site www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about the other participants and can put down their marks on the criteria proposed for each functional area.
The methodology for constructing the rating is based on the principle &quot;The best choose the best&quot;: top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle allows you to get the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
All interested candidates of the current year rating and multiple candidates of the rating of previous years are invited to the face-to-face meetings of the expert commissions.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission to approve the list of top managers and eight commissions to approve the heads of functional areas.
At the meetings of the expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (places are kept strictly according to the Internet assessment and are classified information until the rating is published) or to make adjustments that update them according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of Kommersant.
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
A comfortable rate for an investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market for lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January-April this year sank by 40%.
How do you assess the situation today?
After the panic of late 2014 - early 2015, the volume of lending to SMEs decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp rise in interest rates.
Lending at 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.
If earlier the bank could lay in the increased rate all its possible problems in the future, from delays to non-refunds, now it is impossible to do: the rates are already sky-high.
For business, the current level of interest rates on SME loans is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable from the point of view of their payback.
A rate level of 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns on them.
To what extent, according to your estimates, is the entrepreneurs&#39; demand for loans being satisfied?
After the Central Bank cut the interest rate, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, clients began to apply for loans much less frequently.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects for its development and future income.
Today business has only one way out: it is necessary to learn how to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to more closely monitor the current results, control the flow of funds.
At the same time, given the availability of financial resources, it is worth using new technologies to modernize equipment, reduce production and power supply costs.
All this, ultimately, allows the company to make its products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the SME lending market that will strengthen and will influence its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for a decrease in the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator is demonstrating consistency in the issue of lowering the key rate.
However, one should not expect a radical drop in the price of loans for SMEs.
In the current situation, the problem is, first of all, inflation, which makes it necessary to raise the interest rate to generate real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even if the Central Bank rates are cut.
If we talk about the level of delays, then traditionally small and medium-sized companies, which are limited both in the possibilities of replenishing funds and in the options for correcting economic behavior, will certainly pose a greater risk for creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country&#39;s economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is spelled in Japanese characters.
Nice, laconic and at the same time quite difficult for those who are used to Cyrillic or Latin.
So the new crossover CX-5, like, indeed, any other model of the brand: without pretentiousness, attractive from the outside, technically perfect inside.
The Japanese, simply by virtue of their &quot;Japaneseness&quot;, is able to bring the attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of complete delight.
You can give as many arguments in favor of cars from other countries as you like, and a person will even agree with these arguments in principle, but the whole conversation will crumble from the final phrase: “But this is a Japanese car!
So there is nothing to argue about!
Such people probably should love not only technology, but everything else Japanese.
Quoting Basho on the fly, spicing up food with wasabi, collecting katanas and dressing your girlfriend - no, not in a kimono, of course, but according to the canons of Japanese street fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps, the Japanese school uniform is the only uniform that girls wear with pleasure after graduation.
She has amazing properties: both sensual and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the radiator grille with five horizontal lines.
But a new pattern of headlights and taillights changes the appearance of the car much more, by which the car is instantly recognizable in the stream of cars.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks quite seductive.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but the appearance at the same time has a touch of severity.
You don&#39;t have to call the police.
One of the safest in the world, the CX-5 offers only stoic Japanese calm.
The 2.2 liter diesel engine delivers high torque over a wide speed range.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 liters. s. - only 5.9 liters. The power unit is completed with an exclusively automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.
Black boots, black raincoat, black bag ...
To add a touch of black humor to this look, you can opt for leggings with a print from the Not Cross police tape.
However, Mazda has made every effort to ensure that you do not find yourself in the place of your own accident while driving the CX-5.
To further enhance comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the front and rear shock absorbers have been redesigned and the front lower arm bushings have been redesigned.
The all-wheel drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
Road and engine noise at high speeds is reduced by 13%.
A floral or striped swimsuit is as boring as a budget sedan.
It&#39;s a different matter if a girl is sporting a swimsuit with an original pattern.
For example, from a computer game in the RPG genre.
Then she will get no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved seat design for both the front and rear seating, which provides optimal headroom for both broad shoulders and long legs - whoever has what.
Long-legged ones will surely appreciate the fact that the stops at the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in turns.
The widest range of Mazda active safety systems is offered on the CX-5.
It uses radars, lasers and cameras to identify potential threats.
There is also adaptive lighting, and lane departure warning, and monitoring of blind spots, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best roof racks in the class.
Convenient, with a minimum of protrusions, it accommodates a load of 561 liters. The rear seats fold in a 4: 2: 4 ratio - with each section equipped with a separate extension lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1,560 liters.
The costume of a cartoon character in Japan is called &quot;kigurumi&quot;.
Kigurumi pajamas look especially perky.
Everything is possible in it!
Sleep, of course.
But also - to entertain young children.
Or just walk around with such an animal down the street ...
It&#39;s so great when you have the opportunity to choose - cool clothes, demeanor or a car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the material Kawaicat store.
Kiev tore apart the atomic union.
Kiev has officially formalized Ukraine&#39;s refusal to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday, on the second attempt, nevertheless voted to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements on the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed back in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to start implementing the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law terminating the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth units at the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant.
The bill introduced by the government of the country was carried out only from the second vote, the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the required minimum of 226, but then, when re-voting, 234 members of parliament spoke in favor of the bill.
The Khmelnitsky NPP, which was founded during the Soviet era, according to the initial design, was supposed to have four power units of 1 GW each with VVER-type reactors, but only two were built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the completion of the construction led by 2010 to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement, in 2011-2012 the Rada adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the blocks would have to be built on a loan from the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to curtail relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing its refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant and on the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations have been preserved was the purchase of fuel for the operating Ukrainian nuclear power plants in Russia (they provided about half of the country&#39;s electricity generation), since so far the Ukrainian NNEGC Energoatom has nothing to replace Russian supplies with.
The plans to complete the construction of the Khmelnytsky nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been completely abandoned: back in 2014, in Kiev, they announced negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.
UN Secretary General is against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that it is impossible to resolve the situation in Syria by military means.
&quot;There is no military solution,&quot; - AP quotes his answer to a question regarding military support for Syria from Russia.
Ban Ki-moon also announced that he would hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will be meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent member states of the UN Security Council later this month.
&quot;The meeting will be on Syria,&quot; he said.
Earlier today, the Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of creating an air force base in Syria in the future.
There are no such plans yet.
&quot;But anything can happen,&quot; Mr. Bogdanovsky said.
Earlier, Kommersant reported that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to official Damascus is necessary to fight the Islamic State terrorist group banned in Russia.
Read more about US doubts about Russian aid to Syria in the Kommersant article &quot;The Russian military presence in Syria worries Washington.&quot;
The OSCE PA reports on a possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
Artur Gerasimov, head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), announced the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in southeastern Ukraine.
&quot;What I know: a certain meeting is planned this year, possibly between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations,&quot; TASS quoted Mr. Gerasimov as saying.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and &quot;return to the normal life of our countries.&quot;
When asked whether, in his opinion, dialogue between Ukraine and Russia is currently possible at the parliamentary level - in the &quot;Normandy format&quot; or in the format of a contact group at the OSCE PA platform - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue has been held, there are Minsk agreements ...
At the same time, according to the politician, any kind of dialogue is supported in Kiev.
Earlier, Ukraine&#39;s representative at the talks, ex-president of the country Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics have not fundamentally changed their positions in the trilateral negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the electoral commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the elections to the city duma in the municipal district, distributing 12 deputy mandates, played out on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about irregularities during the elections were voiced by representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, who accused the election commission of &quot;covering up fraud.&quot;
The opposition’s comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the electoral commission refused to the party &quot;Communists of Russia&quot; in organizing a referendum concerning the abolition of payments for the overhaul of apartment buildings.
The city electoral commission officially presented the results of the elections to the city duma of Nizhny Novgorod in the municipal constituency.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the voter lists in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand were issued ballots to precinct commissions, and 268 thousand voters voted in the elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were declared invalid, and 24 - lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed among political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of United Russia, six seats in the City Duma are given to Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the Liberal Democratic Party was received by the leader of the party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Two mandates of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation were distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
Three mandates of A Just Russia go to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will work as deputies in the city duma: in case of refusal from the mandate, he goes to the next candidate on the party list.
The chairman of the city election committee, Aleksandr Makeev, told the members of the commission that he was introducing duty to &quot;send telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others&quot; with a view to refusing mandates.
When approving the protocol on the election results, representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation declared multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the gorizbirkom with an advisory vote from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, proposed not to recognize the voting results in four constituencies No. 21-24, recalling that by order of the head of the Sormovsky district administration, the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located, was closed.
For a long time, neither the deputies of the State Administration, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers could get inside, and the resonant scandal with the storming of the doors of the district administration was shown on television.
At the meetings of the district commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right of an advisory vote had the opportunity to be present.
The head stopped access to them only when the voting ended and the precinct commissions had not yet arrived to hand over their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
&quot;Then the chapter was corrected, and interested persons could be present at all meetings,&quot; Natalya Andryushina, a member of the regional election committee, retorted.
The communists objected that the deputy of the regional legislative assembly Lyudmila Aristova was illegally detained in the blocked administration building for more than four hours, about which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also outraged that in a number of PECs on election day they began to seal ballot boxes at 6-7 a.m., placing ballots for early voting in them.
At the same time, no one notified the members of the commissions with the right of an advisory vote and observers, so they arrived at the start of the elections at 8 am.
The Communists are sure that in the morning before the opening of polling stations, ballots could be thrown into the ballot boxes uncontrollably.
However, the election commission, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, according to Alexander Makeyev, did not find any violations with the stuffing of unaccounted ballots.
The members of the commission did not support the proposal of their colleague from &quot;Fair Russia&quot; Maria Popova through the regional electoral committee to come out with amendments to regional legislation in order to clearly establish the time for opening the envelopes with early voting ballots, which then fall into the ballot box.
“On your own initiative, contact the CEC at least,” Aleksandr Makeev advised Mrs. Popova.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Sergei Samokhin attacked the chairman with loud accusations, shouting that the election commission was ignoring dozens of complaints and covering up electoral fraud.
&quot;You are not here at a rally, declare more carefully!&quot; - the chairman of the electoral committee was offended.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
By September 27, the electoral commission must approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the city duma of Nizhny Novgorod of the sixth convocation will be scheduled within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city election commission refused to register an initiative group for the political party &quot;Communists of Russia&quot; for holding a local referendum.
Judging by the documents, the party members were going to bring up two questions for discussion in Nizhny Novgorod: do they agree that the fees for the overhaul of apartment buildings should be &quot;immediately canceled&quot;, and tariffs for housing and communal services should be &quot;frozen until 2020&quot;.
However, the lawyer of the Duma, Irina Maslova, explained that the appeal of the &quot;Communists of Russia&quot; is contrary to the law.
FedEx&#39;s revenue is mixed, with lower forecasts for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results in the last quarter, and the delivery giant cut its annual profit forecast as demand for trucking services fell and costs rose in its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in preliminary trading 45 minutes before the stock exchange opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $ 10.84 according to a FactSet survey.
The downward trend is seen despite an average 4.9 percent increase in rates, which will take effect on January 4, and an increase in land transport charges for heavy or oversized cargo, which begins in November.
The company said it still expects to see revenue growth from last year thanks to cost cuts, higher gross income, and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot;performed well given the weak compared to forecast economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade.&quot;
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after competitor UPS announced that they planned to hire an additional 95,000 employees, roughly the same as last year.
For the quarter ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $ 692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $ 2.42, close to the $ 2.44 per share forecast by Zacks Investment Research in a survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased 5% to $ 12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by the Zacks estimated $ 12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a downturn in the urgent international shipping sector, resulting in a lack of gross revenue growth in its express shipping division.
However, a boom in online shopping has dramatically improved results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, ground transportation revenues were up 29%, but operating income remained largely unchanged due to higher costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express business unit earned higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector, income fell due to higher labor costs.
In preliminary trading, about an hour before the opening of the exchange, FedEx shares fell by $ 3.85 or 2.5 percent - to $ 150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling 11 percent on the year and 17 percent below their June 11 record.
At their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve executives will spend two days this week at a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table deciding whether it&#39;s time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of an ornate meeting room, two stories high, a wall painting of the United States will hang over it.
This card is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must prioritize the country&#39;s economic interests above all others.
The central bank has received a double mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Federal System officials have acknowledged that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And that third order may be an unknown factor in a near-predicted decision, due Thursday, on whether the US economy is ready to pull away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Even though most of the data shows strong economic growth, recent turmoil in global financial markets may deter already cautious Federal system leaders from adding volatility by raising the federal funds base rate - even by as little as a quarter percentage point.
“It is clear that the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important subject to consider,” said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co.
&quot;However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further,&quot; she said.
There is no consensus on what the Federal Reserve will do, which in itself provokes financial market fluctuations.
About half of economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a rise in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to hold back from this, with the key indicator showing only about a 30% chance of a rapid rally.
This could lead to a drop in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, provided that decision-makers do not soften the blow with the promise that the next increase will not be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Index climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The boom was fueled by expectations that policymakers in the Federal system will leave the bet this week, said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody&#39;s Capital Markets Research.
&quot;It will be a surprise if the Federal System raises rates at this point in time,&quot; he said.
If the Federal Reserve Board does so, &quot;they will have to go far in approving their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so they don&#39;t panic.&quot;
Other experts argued that a rate hike could calm financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the Fed appears to be leaning towards a 0.25% rate hike this month, making the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expects a rate hike this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been steady this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and close to what the Federal system considers full employment.
Wage growth is showing signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank&#39;s target of 2% for the year, the Federal System said the key reason was the temporary effect of the sharp drop in oil prices.
The economy &quot;can handle and need higher rates, given the shrinking labor market,&quot; said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones average for industrial stocks fell as much as 16% from a record high in May as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy could stunt global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month and the Dow Jones is now about 10% below its May high.
For the management of the Federal Reserve System, market outrage further complicates the difficult calculation of the timing of the rate hike.
&quot;Without news of what happened in the financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would be tightening the screws at this meeting,&quot; said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former employee of Federal Reserve System.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
&quot;There is a lot of uncertainty about what the implications for the American economy could be, and they have little hard data after the latest events in China,&quot; Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not a major concern of the Federal System and should not technically be considered when making these decisions.
But in essence, the Federal Reserve System has become the world&#39;s financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint from then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve might &quot;muffle&quot; its monetary expansion caused market turmoil around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined with each other, one would expect Federal Reserve officials to not only monitor developments throughout, but also consult with representatives of other Central Banks and experts to better understand the global economy. ...
Their decision-making process is &quot;more art than science,&quot; said Zachary Carabell, chief executive of Envestnet Inc, a global wealth management strategy company.
Jeffrey Lucker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that &quot;in the history of the Federal Reserve there have been instances of overreaction to financial market movements that do not appear to be related to economic principles.&quot;
Lucker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who pushed for a rate hike, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis caused the Fed to cut its base rate by 0.75% over three meetings, &quot;despite limited identifiable implications for US growth,&quot; Lucker said.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal System reversed these reductions.
The Federal Reserve should only prioritize stability concerns during major crises such as the 2008 market crash, ”said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England&#39;s interest rate committee.
The latest panic has not come close to that level, he said.
&quot;You would certainly not want to be in a situation where you are intimidated by the rise in rates due to the fact that the markets are in shock,&quot; - said Posen, president of the Institute for World Economy. Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don&#39;t think they should be ahead of the curve.

State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin admits that the United States is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that waves of refugees rush to Europe.
As reported by &quot;Interfax&quot;, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulan Bator during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
&quot;I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question begs itself: is not Europe the ultimate goal of those who, with such maniacal persistence in recent years, have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East?&quot; he asked.
&quot;After all, someone probably assumed and knew that the streams of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who are fleeing from death, will rush to the prosperous EU countries,&quot; he added.
Naryshkin asked: &quot;How many political leaders in Europe have spoken frankly about the reasons for this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally overwhelming their countries?&quot;
“No, old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to be silent,” he stated.
According to Naryshkin, NATO tramples on many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially looked at how moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law are being trampled down with a military boot tailored to NATO standards,” the speaker stressed.
Government forces and paramilitaries loyal to them are opposed by insurgents, consisting mainly of Islamists.
Later, the Islamic State terrorist group, banned in Russia, joined the opponents of the Syrian government.
The US supports the rebels who oppose both Assad and IS.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The Syrian President named the reason for the West&#39;s hostility towards Russia.
The claims of the West to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, Channel One, Rossiya 24, NTV, Rossiya Segodnya, TASS, Interfax and Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put in his place another, who will act in the interests of Western countries, and not in the interests of his homeland, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn in the Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;has turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in an undemocratic way, despite the fact that he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West. &quot;.
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the constant statements of the West that Assad himself must leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves, then at the request of the people, and not by the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or Geneva Communiqué.
&quot;If the people want him to stay, the president will stay, otherwise he should leave immediately,&quot; he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded that cooperation is being carried out with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism together with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking about military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He denied claims that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran supplies us with military equipment.
&quot;Naturally, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out,&quot; he explained.
As for the rest of the states, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
&quot;We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-IS coalition led by the United States,&quot; Assad said.
The death toll exceeded 230 thousand people, the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the Islamic State terrorist group, banned in Russia.
An international coalition led by the United States is launching air strikes on IS positions.
Flooding killed 12 people in Utah.
In the US state of Utah, floods have killed at least 12 people.
Another one is missing, reports Fox 13 Salt Lake City.
The water washed away several cars with people in them in Washington County.
One of them, the van where the family was, stopped in a danger zone near the water, and the stream suddenly overtook him.
The youngest victim was four years old.
All the victims were residents of the areas of Colorado City and Hildale, which were affected by the disaster.
There are also reports of three children who were rescued.
650 teams are involved in search and rescue operations.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: World: Lenta.ru
US Secretary of State John Kerry held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to State Department spokesman John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby provided no further details.
At the same time, he said that the United States has the tools to &quot;further isolate Russia&quot; if it supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov, during a conversation with Kerry, again emphasized the need to create a united front to combat terrorist groups operating in that country.
They also discussed ways of resolving the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
In addition, some issues of a bilateral nature were touched upon.
Earlier, US officials said Russia was stepping up its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about Moscow&#39;s growing support for Assad.
Washington said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, the press secretary of the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, said that the country would not fall into international isolation.
The rebels are in favor of overthrowing the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was seized by the Islamic State terrorist organization.
An international coalition led by the United States is subjecting IS positions to air strikes.
Borodai called the information of the American newspaper a slander against Strelkov.
Former chairman of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&#39;s Republic, Alexander Borodai, denied the information that was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He stated this in a telephone interview to the &quot;Lenta.ru&quot; correspondent.
The wonderful thing about the Washington Post post is that it’s completely flipped.
The former DPR Minister of Defense Igor Strelkov, naturally, was not tied up and he &quot;left&quot; the territory of the Donbass republics in a very high spirits, without ropes, without three wagons of money attributed to him by different characters, &quot;he said.
According to Borodai, there was indeed a talk about Strelkov in a conversation with a reporter from an American newspaper.
“Yes, I said that Strelkov urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People&#39;s Republic,” said the former head of the DPR government.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia &quot;bound&quot;.
I suspect this is a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, then these are surprisingly misunderstood words, since I emphasized that Strelkov left himself, &quot;Borodai noted.
“This is slander both against me and against Strelkov,” he concluded.
Earlier, an article appeared on the pages of The Washington Post, which quoted Borodai&#39;s words that he had taken Strelkov to Russia forcibly.
According to the newspaper, Borodai noted that he was forced to tie his comrade-in-arms.
The Polish authorities began searching for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish lumberjacks have begun cutting down trees above the underground tunnel, where, according to some sources, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, according to Reuters.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to check the reliability of rumors about a train with treasures.
Weapons and valuable minerals may be inside the train.
On August 31, the governor of Poland&#39;s Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence for the existence of a train with gold was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to cordon off the search area.
Three days earlier, Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland Piotr Zhuchowski said that local treasure hunters with &quot;a 99 percent probability&quot; found the very train with the gold of the Third Reich, which is said in the legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewelry is found, they will become the property of the state treasury, and the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm approached the authorities of the Polish city of Walbrzych with the message that they had found a train in a walled-up tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
The chief narcologist of Russia proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Evgeny Brun noted that up to this age &quot;any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - has a particularly detrimental effect.&quot;
So he said on the air of the radio station &quot;Moscow speaking&quot;, commenting on the information that the speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
A person ripens unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a person is physically ready for this.
Mentally, he is ready for a full life in society from the age of 21.
&quot;It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry finally matures only by the age of 21,&quot; said Brune.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the Sober Russia project, Sultan Khamzaev, told Izvestia that Matvienko supported the initiative to raise the age limit for alcohol sales and &quot;agreed, together with the Public Chamber, to raise this issue again on the platform of the upper house of parliament.&quot;
According to the activist, a working group will soon be created in the Federation Council to develop a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
Bible was asked to check for compliance with child information protection law
A resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor&#39;s office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law &quot;On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development,&quot; the Sib.fm correspondent got acquainted with the statement on September 16.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society in the Chitai-Gorod store on Red Avenue.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his opinion, violate the Federal Law &quot;On the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development.&quot;
On September 16, the application was accepted for consideration by the prosecutor&#39;s office of the city of Novosibirsk.
The response to the appeal of a resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is far from banning the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - the applicant commented to the correspondent of Sib.fm.
Moreover, this is a very fundamental problem that will stir up society.
It will begin to reread the Bible, which it has not done before.
Brazilian Union of Pediatricians Rio Grande promotes healthy eating for breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a controversial method by which it is going to convince women of the need for nutritious nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves displaying images of babies sucking on breasts painted with images of junk food.
Breast milk contains a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy requirements of pregnant women and women who have given birth, it is recommended to increase the daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, recent research suggests that a single increase in calorie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that eating healthy pregnant women actually affects gene expression in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative effects of unhealthy diets on a child&#39;s immune system have been identified.
A school bus was rammed by a train near Hamburg.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that got stuck on the railroad track.
A 23-year-old female driver, realizing that she could not move off the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute after that, a collision occurred in front of their eyes.
He was filmed on video by one of the schoolchildren.
Due to the emergency, panic arose among the students.
Some of the children started crying and ran along the side of the road.
The route is still blocked.
Miraculously, no one was injured, police said, except for one passenger on the train, who was slightly injured.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors are calling to ban boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country following the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a duel with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with Magali&#39;s victory by knockout in the 12th round.
Brown was admitted to the hospital with a head injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to a life support apparatus.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and ended one fight in a draw.
He is survived by two children.
This is the second fatality among Australian boxers in the past six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Braydon Smith died from injuries sustained in the ring.
Now AMA recommends not to engage in this sport, but rather, from its point of view, to ban it altogether.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally, - said the vice president of the organization Stephen Parnis. -
But in the form in which boxing now exists, there will always be situations when an athlete suffers a hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads to either death or serious injury.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body of medical practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Sergei Naryshkin called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
He stated this, speaking at the session of the OSCE PA in Ulan Bator.
We assess this as unacceptable actions, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
&quot;And this should not be repeated, because this is a manifestation of political shamelessness and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue,&quot; the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let&#39;s get morality back into politics.
Let&#39;s return dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let&#39;s return humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
&quot;Duplicity never ended well,&quot; he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I urge the members of the Assembly to concentrate on the following specific tasks in ensuring security.
&quot;First, on the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convocation of our inter-parliamentary group,&quot; Naryshkin said.
He also noted that it is necessary to pay tribute to the OSCE.
&quot;This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine,&quot; the politician stressed.
Let us remind you that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until September 18.
I enjoyed the victory for a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumphant one for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergei SHUBENKOV.
He managed to win the European team championship at his signature distance of 110 meters with hurdles, set several records, and most importantly - become the world champion, and the first in the history of the national hurdle sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the Diamond League, finishing in third place overall.
Novye Izvestia asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the outgoing season.
Sergey, is the season not over for you yet?
Yes, I am going to perform at the World War Games, which will be held in Korea in October, and then I will think about rest.
True, I will now prepare at home, in Barnaul, but being at home is still a completely different state.
It&#39;s easier than wandering around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favorite season.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a great time.
Passions after the main start of the season have boiled off, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.
You can compete in fun, relaxed.
Plus you know that the vacation is coming soon ...
Is there any fatigue?
Still, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions ...
Fatigue always builds up towards the end of the season.
And here it doesn&#39;t matter what he did more - won or lost.
Every competition is stressful.
Constant flights, travel - all this does not pass without a trace for the body.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now, of course, my emotions are on the rise.
What is there - I&#39;m just happy!
Do you come back often to the time you finished at the World Championships in Beijing?
It happens.
And you, journalists, do not let me forget about it.
But in general, I think that an athlete who lives on old victories is bad, scrolls his successful races over and over again.
I enjoyed the victory for a couple of days - and we must move on.
Was your preparation for this wonderful season very different from your usual one?
I can&#39;t say that there was something so special.
We started preparing back in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the training camp, then again at home.
Everything is as usual.
But with the coach we set a task: to try to reach a new level, which I have not yet been.
Almost all of the winter time was spent laying the base.
We ran a bunch of crosses, did exercises for general physical training, which included both the deadlift and the squat, and we pumped up the back.
Then they got down to hurdle training, did a lot of technique.
Did you follow the performance of the opponents?
I always try to do this, since in the era of the Internet there are no problems with this.
I watched the European Winter Championship, and there the French took the entire podium in the hurdle sprint!
I also thought: something needs to be done, to dilute this company.
With each start this season, you have added and added in results.
Did it give you confidence?
For me, all recent seasons have been developing in approximately the same way.
There is no such thing that I run at first 13.20, and then - 13.50.
I always unwind my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was to run out of 13 seconds.
All work was aimed primarily at this result.
But the paradox is that you seem to feel that you are ready for heroic deeds, but at competitions it is not always possible to show your readiness.
How was it, for example, at the London Olympics?
To be honest, I tried to forget that semifinal race (Shubenkov could not qualify for the final. - &quot;NO&quot;) right away.
I was ready very well, I could really run out in 13 seconds.
Yes, even if he repeated his best result at that time, he would have become the bronze medalist of the Games.
But no luck.
Do you remember your first world championship?
But what about?
It was in Daegu.
Then I really wanted to get into the finals, there was such a maximum program.
And fell off right in the morning, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that to tear and rush at breakneck speed means not running anywhere at all.
Two years later, at the World Championships in Moscow, he reached the final with the best time.
I remember well my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the &quot;gold&quot; even then!
How do you manage, while developing a decent speed, not to lose your head, not to pass out?
And this is the most difficult thing.
You have to be very careful, focused on technique, so as not to knock down barriers.
I noticed that when you tune in not to the result, but to the process, it is much easier.
And the thrill is when you have the feeling that you are running and everything seems to work out by itself!
Honestly, it&#39;s worth it.
Many of our athletes from the provinces, after the first serious successes, tend to move closer to the capital.
Never had such thoughts?
It&#39;s still better at home.
And I can&#39;t even imagine where I am without my coach, who needs me?
It might be nice to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
Have you been together with Klevtsov for a long time?
From the age of 12, since he came to athletics.
More precisely, at first I trained with his wife, who worked with children, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then jumped in length, triple.
Children&#39;s all-around was - this is when they throw the ball, jump in length from the spot ...
At 14 I tried hurdling and I liked it.
From the very first race, it turned out to fulfill the standard of the second adult category.
And so it remained.
Have you never had a fear of barriers?
Somehow I immediately managed to come to an agreement with them.
But the technique always had to work a lot.
How much I suffered over one overclocking!
But this routine is inevitable.
The technique must be constantly honed - so that at night I could be woken up, I immediately got up and ran through the barriers.
Everyone who has seen your run in Beijing claims that it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
Usually I don&#39;t watch my races, but here I could not resist.
But you need to work on efficiency further - there are no limits to perfection.
Aren&#39;t you afraid now that the victory a year before the Olympic Games will fall on the shoulders of a heavy burden?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
Once I have chosen this road, then I must go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you are not a weakling, you should not feel any additional burden.
And I absolutely agree with him.
Otar Kushanashvilli
Well, I&#39;m not so naive as to be surprised at the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, do not feed them with bread - give, throw up the enemy.
And although I did not wrap myself with a flag, and the same, exactly the same, I said a million times here, and did not directly call anyone a bastard, something else hurt me.
All my pseudo-friends instantly, in a second, disappeared somewhere.
The pressure to which I am exposed is so strong that even I, a seasoned boy, think that the henbane people overeat.
It was as if he was walking, walking, and a crowd attacked you and, well, mutuz with rods.
But you need to know me, I’m not a room eagle, I’m with a fist, I’ll shoot a howitzer, I’m old, guys, to be afraid.
Another thing is no support.
I had no illusions anyway, but now ...
Self-sufficiency has always been the best in me, so take a bite.
And giving passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson can only be assholes.
It would be better for me, the best journalist, to have a shameful job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili sharply described the Crimean events:
What they did to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
This is what is called annexation.
I believe that the reference to how the tipsy Khrushchev tried to sign something does not in any way fit into the general picture of human society.
It&#39;s like coming to a neighbor and taking his living space ...
The war has started from the Kremlin, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, it began with a call from some bastard from the Kremlin dungeon.
I have guesses who it could be ...
Kobzon doesn&#39;t have much left to live.
I don&#39;t understand, he is the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin&#39;s hands.
Is he going to lose his apartment?
Well, they demolished his monument.
Of course, people remembered him as insulting their small homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Seven&#39;s Sunrise Leads The Rankings Despite The Ninth&#39;s Efforts To Cover The Leader&#39;s Loss On The Today Show
A sortie by Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal Party’s announcement to vacate the leader’s seat did not significantly boost Today&#39;s ratings.
The Ninth&#39;s morning show aired from the state capital following Malcolm Turnbull&#39;s defeat of Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with hosts David Koch and Samantha Armitage, is stuck in London for a weeklong international broadcast that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture by distance did not seem to matter much to Australian television viewers, with Sunrise&#39;s audience of 397,000 in the five largest cities compared to Today&#39;s 339,000.
Today scored slightly higher than its ratings on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to 330,000 for Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap fluctuated between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers in September against Today&#39;s 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!

Big news for Seven was 800 Words&#39; groundbreaking debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thomson.
The new drama about a newly widowed father of a family who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children has amassed an impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics speculated whether Thomson could handle the popular show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening was a resounding yes.
Seven&#39;s The X Factor remained strong with an audience of 1.136 million, easily surpassing The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had a mix of good luck and bad luck on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (from 5:00 pm to 5:30 pm) of the new game show, hosted by Andrew O&#39;Keefe, attracted 446,000 viewers.
For the second half hour (from 5:30 pm to 6:00 pm) the figure jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire&#39;s Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of Chase Australia attracted 520,000 viewers and the second half an overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat raised 620,000.
The drop in Chase Australia&#39;s ratings on the second night will force Ninth to quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for the Million Dollar Minute that failed to beat McGwire&#39;s show.

The three finalists agree that &quot;The Bachelor&quot; Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Is the secret revealed? ...
Lana Jevon-Fellows, Sarah McKay and Snezhana Markoski may have accidentally made it clear which one of them would win in The Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually remain in &quot;The Bachelor&quot; is surrounded by a veil of secrecy.
And the three girls who reached the final, of course, remain silent about which of them received his last rose.
But when we met with Sarah McKay, Snezhana Markoski and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls should remain, they may have accidentally given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood remains staunchly silent until Thursday&#39;s finale
All three women get into a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the ideal man, while mentioning his sense of humor, purposefulness, family values, cheerfulness as the reasons why each of them would be happy to become his companion.
However, his answers to the question &quot;If not you, then who should get the last Rose of Wood?&quot; they could unwittingly tell which of them actually won the heart of the &quot;Bachelor&quot;.
Jevons-Fellows and Markoski did not hesitate to call McKay the perfect match for Wood.
From day one, Sarah and Sam developed a good relationship.
&quot;From the moment I joined the cast, I felt (Sarah&#39;s) energy and Sam&#39;s energy and knew they fit together very well, and throughout the show I didn&#39;t doubt it,&quot; said Jevons-Fellows.
&quot;Sarah is a very open person, it is easy and fun to be with her,&quot; added Markoski.
I saw them together, there really is an attraction between them.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will make a great couple.
McKay herself said that thanks to house dates last week, she realized that Wood may be &quot;the same person.&quot;
“As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that this was definitely not just a game - I believed him with all my heart,” she says.
When asked who Voodoo should choose if it wasn&#39;t her, she answered mysteriously.
“I don’t know if I can talk about it,” she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snezhana and Lana are equally worthy of it.
The Bachelor airs on Wednesdays at 7:30 pm on Channel Ten.

Jarrid Hayne had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle have taken a strong interest in him since his move to the US - as have dozens of other clubs that have sent in inquiries after an impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne picked the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul and it looks like it was a wise decision.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench for the remainder of the game after the former Australian rugby league player made a first comeback in a 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another opportunity to return the pant, and also used him in the game after the injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula showed himself on a good side after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of cheering the newcomers in front of the team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly endorsed Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers Special Reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received support from Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball on a pant return to the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter
Hayne and his many Australian fans clearly did not count on such a start to his NHL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing as he left the field after losing the ball, and later told the host of Hamish &amp; Andy on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn&#39;t have imagined a more bad start to his NFL career.
&quot;It happens, you just think about the next game and that&#39;s it,&quot; Hayne said.
Hayne likened his miss to his debut in the Origin series of games in 2007, when a shot in his home zone brought a shot to Queensland.
In the end, this experience proved to be very rewarding for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne posed for a picture with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted it on Instagram.

According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian parliament tightened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, and an expedited procedure for processing asylum requests.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, in connection with which he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary for one year.
Also, the Hungarian parliament in the near future intends to consider the issue of transferring the functions of protecting the border to the country&#39;s parliament to the Hungarian armed forces.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a 175 km long barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian admitted to committing the largest cyberattack in US history.

During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia&#39;s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
&quot;Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia&#39;s support for President Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of fighting extremism, if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power,&quot; the message said. published on the website of the US Department of State.
Kerry reaffirmed the US commitment to the fight against the Islamic State group (whose activities are banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) as part of a coalition of more than 60 states.

Four killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police fired rubber bullets into crowds protesting the country&#39;s proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence happened on Tuesday evening in Rupandei District, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country&#39;s capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, head of the district police, said more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside a police station, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal said the police used tear gas, then fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is unclear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality rates.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in southern, lowland Nepal, where the Madesi say the new provinces under the new constitution will diminish their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, among Taru citizens who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since 10
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been under way since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process following a devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted on articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise with 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as a center of the chemical industry, has a developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
He told the &quot;Oblastnaya&quot; correspondent about the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects.
Oleg Valerievich, how did you start your work as mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of audits of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit examination of the spending of local budget funds.
Then an audit of the municipal property was carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the workflow to five days.
Previously, papers could go around for months.
Measures were developed to increase the revenue base and optimize costs.
In November last year, a visiting meeting of the government took place in Sayansk, where issues of socio-economic development of the territory were considered.
There was no design estimate documentation (DED) for any object in the city.
Without this, Sayansk could not take part in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of design and estimate documentation for roads, a kindergarten, the northern sewer and a water conduit.
Now road works are already underway at two sections.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such a positive demography has not been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of provision of places in kindergartens is one of the most urgent today.
On September 1, kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 children, was closed for major repairs.
The estimated cost of the repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, after renovation, kindergarten No. 23 was opened, which is now attended by 200 children.
The renovation was done on the terms of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost amounted to more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the help of the regional government, funds were found for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the People&#39;s Initiatives program also helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the sequence of children aged one and a half to three years.
We have no queues for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors showing interest in the area?
We have a clear understanding that the construction in the city should be carried out, first of all, by Sayan enterprises, it is they who need to be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphans in the Leningradsky microdistrict will be commissioned.
As for the construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of the Angara region, which was included in the program for the construction of economy-class housing.
All the necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 block-sections will begin shortly.
In total, we announced the construction of 10 thousand square meters. m of housing There are a lot of people willing to participate in the program.
One of the conditions is that housing should be no more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this price includes turnkey finishing.
If we cope with the given volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we also have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Sayan pig farm was built on the territory, which in 2004 was sold for a pittance.
We are working with the prosecutor&#39;s office to challenge this transaction.
Moreover, the land under the object is in federal ownership.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to regional ownership is being resolved, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor willing to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the launch of the pig-breeding complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great help for the city.
Is the institution of social partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have concluded about 140 social and economic partnership agreements.
Many projects were implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Such enterprises as Vostok-Center CJSC, Novo-Ziminskaya CHPP, Sayansky Broiler LLC, PK MDF LLC provide tangible support, the management of these enterprises responds to all requests.
Directly to the City Day, Sayan Broiler LLC donated a children&#39;s playground to the city, Vostok-Center Company renovated the equestrian yard, where specialists work with children in hypotherapy, spending more than 1 million rubles on this.
Thanks to sponsorship funds, it was possible to improve the territory of the city registry office.
Sponsors helped to colorfully celebrate the City Day.
As in the good old days, a parade was held with the participation of city collectives and organizations.
A chronicle of the city, a book of Sayan poets was published.
The first builders and people who made a serious labor contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded jubilee medals.
Patrons also participate in the work of the city charitable foundation.
The very first step was the acquisition of instruments for young talented musicians.
For nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles were allocated to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from low-income families.
How are personnel problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
The city lacks doctors and subject teachers.
Providing housing for specialists is of great importance for solving the personnel issue.
Over the past year, we allocated five apartments for doctors, and four teachers received service housing.
We have a program for the allocation of housing with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
The plans include redevelopment of the building, in which eight more apartments for teachers will be built.
Also, teachers and doctors participate in the &quot;Housing for a Russian Family&quot; program.
In the future, construction of a house for public sector workers.
The most important thing is that there is an efficient team in the city, with whom I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
Sayansk and our region have great potential.
A bill on the indexation of social benefits, taking into account the rise in prices, has been submitted to the Duma.
A bill has been submitted to the State Duma, providing for the indexation of social pensions annually from February 1, taking into account the rise in prices.
The author of the document - the deputy from &quot;Fair Russia&quot; Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsev - also proposes to carry out an additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the growth rate of the subsistence minimum exceeds the growth rate of prices for goods and services.
The indexation of social pensions, in accordance with the current legislation, is carried out annually from April 1, taking into account the growth rates of the living wage of a pensioner in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law, submitted to the lower house, provides for the introduction of the indexation of social pensions, taking into account the growth rate of consumer prices.
In this case, the first indexation is postponed to February 1, and the second is held on April 1.

Google Launches Doubling Donation Campaign to Raise $ 11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced a doubling of donations campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations helping refugees flooding European countries fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google took an uncharacteristic personal approach when announcing a fundraising campaign on its blog.
Instead of a statement from a senior executive, Google employee Rita Massoud, who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, described her personal experience.
&quot;We traveled on questionable trains and buses, hunger, thirst, cold and fear,&quot; she wrote.
I&#39;m lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe intensified, many people like my family are in desperate need of help.
Donations will go to four non-profit organizations dedicated to helping refugees and migrants: Médecins Sans Frontières, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will double its first $ 5.5 million in donations until google.com/refugeerelief reaches $ 11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, fueled in large part by a four-year civil war in Syria that has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly Obese Diabetics May Help Obesity Surgery
Benefits after obesity surgery in mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that mildly obese diabetics live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving nonsurgical treatment.
&quot;The mortality statistics are not immediately apparent,&quot; said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgery expert who wrote about the new study in the editor&#39;s column for JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of organisms to metabolize food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but the main research has been in people with morbid obesity who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan&#39;s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery and sleeve gastrectomy, with medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in mildly obese people.
The mean BMI of those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year in the study.
At the same time, the BMI of those who received nonsurgical treatment for diabetes remains at about 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and 28% were partially.
In the drug-treated group, by comparison, only 1% had complete cure for diabetes, and only about 2% had partial cure.
In addition, blood pressure, triglyceride and &quot;bad&quot; LDL cholesterol scores were generally better in the surgical group, &quot;the authors state.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
In the treatment group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
But better glycemic control, mirrored by good hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality rates in five years, according to research leader Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, in comparison with the group that received sleeve gastrectomy, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), achieved a greater decrease in BMI (by 7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3, 1% versus 2.1%), and was also closer to complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not show the benefits of surgery in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgery does lead to increased life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the Phoenix College of Medicine. University of Arizona.
In a Swedish study, obese people who opted for bariatric intervention were about 29% less likely to die within 15 years compared to the more traditional group.
Although the new study showed no increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encourages people with a BMI below 35 to be interested in the procedure.
“The report is very important here because it argues that surgery is safe in the low BMI group, where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as a patient&#39;s BMI falls between 27 and 30.
“I think we&#39;re waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
It seems to me that once they have accumulated the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, reversing this is very difficult.
In Mytishchi, robbers took out a fur coat and 9 million rubles from the house.
In Mytishchi, robbers attacked residents of a house near Moscow and stole from them 9 million rubles and three women&#39;s fur coats.
This is reported by &quot;Interfax&quot; with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown persons entered the house located on Gorky Street through an open front door, tied up the 20-year-old son of the mistress of the house and, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million rubles and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case was initiated under the article &quot;Robbery&quot;.
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to watch the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
The rest of the hotels are in no hurry to get the appropriate permission.
According to experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
On the eve of the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to resettle all the guests of the city.
Rosbalt&#39;s interlocutors believe that because of the tournament, the cost of renting apartments for rent will increase by 10-30%, and even after the championship they will have to overpay for rented apartments.
The FIFA World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for the championship, each hotel in St. Petersburg must go through the classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of inspections that they often do not even send documents to requests from the Federal Antimonopoly Service in St. Petersburg.
As the head of the OFAS, Vadim Vladimirov, said, the department studied 138 hotels and now plans to open 34 cases in relation to hotels, many of which simply did not respond to the anti-monopoly authorities.
There are indications that the management of three dozen companies deceived citizens by placing a certain number of stars in advertising, said Vladimirov.
The problem is that now literally every number counts, none can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels during the football championship.
Now in the city tourists can count on 30.5 thousand rooms.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, and 550 one-star hotels.
According to Nana Gvichia, First Deputy Committee for Tourism Development, at the moment only 23 hotels have passed the classification - so many checks were carried out by companies accredited in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel ordered a similar procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny, by a surprising coincidence, is not known.
That is, there may be more who have passed the classification, but no one knows about it.
&quot;For the past six months, hotels have not been very eager to pass the classification&quot;, - acknowledged the director of the North-West branch of the Russian Union of Travel Industry Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers make the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets, which did not include the costs of checks, while the procedure can cost the hotel, depending on the status, from 30 to 100 thousand rubles or more.
But still, recently, hotel managers have become more active and began to apply for classification, Shadskaya assured.
Hotels need to be in time before July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but also will not receive the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the stardom, a fixed fee for a hotel room will be developed for the duration of the tournament.
The formulas by which the cost will be calculated will be announced next year.
This is done in order to prevent a rise in prices by 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to have a conscience and not allow a rise in two or three times, but the hotels need to be allowed to earn.
“I think the growth will be up to 50%,” explained Gennady Lamshin, President of the Russian Hotel Association.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixing corresponds to the understanding of a market economy.
I don&#39;t know how much this fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
&quot;This is better than a runaway rise in prices,&quot; he said.
It is unclear what will happen to the popular cheap hostels.
State Duma deputies have introduced a bill according to which hostels should be banned in residential buildings.
We very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not apply to St. Petersburg.
“We will defend the point of view that hostels should be preserved,” Nana Gvacia said.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels in any case should be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma nevertheless approves the bill, then about 80% of hostels will be closed in St. Petersburg, and at the moment they have 1.5 thousand rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers of the North-West Leonid Garbar, St. Petersburg lacks two- and three-star hotels, which are exactly in demand by football fans, but there is a bias towards hotels with four and five stars.
This state of affairs is similar to the situation when &quot;75 thousand VIPs are sitting in an 80-thousandth stadium.&quot;
This can be corrected just at the expense of mini-hotels.
The expert considers their possible ban to be &quot;idiocy&quot;: &quot;It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason newcomers cannot.&quot;
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that this is wrong.
But if it&#39;s like a hotel where guests come for a short time, then why not?
Mini-hotels run the risk of missing the World Cup because of their sluggishness.
Hundreds of small hotels simply do not have time to pass the classification, and they are digging a hole for themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will order works.
&quot;There are not so many companies that can carry out this procedure, so they will refuse less paid orders from mini-hotels, but will choose those that are more expensive,&quot; said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of the passed inspections at the moment are much higher than those in St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is connected, among other things, with constant reshuffles in the tourist block of the government, which does not contribute to well-coordinated work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, they will most likely have to pay attention to regional hotels and rest houses.
Following the example of celebrating the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, the river fleet can be mobilized into the city, that is, the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will arrive prepared in vans, in which they will be able to spend the night.
&quot;The main thing is not to set up so many hotels so that later they would be empty,&quot; Gennady Lamshin is sure.
Also, rental housing will be very popular during the football championship.
Most likely, a reserve of rented apartments will be created in the city.
Rental rates will rise by 10-30%.
“From the obvious, housing near the stadium will be the first to leave,” said Larisa Bragina, a rental specialist at the Real Estate Development and Research Agency.
Moreover, the rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in residential areas.
This will be facilitated by the construction of new transport interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Do not forget about the human qualities of the townspeople.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city, where people not only give directions, but can also conduct a mini-excursion.
There are also complications.
My dad in 1970 in the yard met a family from Murmansk - father, mother and two children.
They had nowhere to spend the night: it was difficult then with hotels, it was hard to sleep at the station.
“And dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep,” the interlocutor recalled.
True, he added that now there is no such trait in the inhabitants of the city - to call them home is fraught with consequences and scary.
But maybe in 2018, after the unsuccessful decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments, we will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky &quot;leaked&quot; the Amur Region.
Today I looked with admiration at Zhirinovsky&#39;s clownery in the State Duma.
He did these things when our generation was just learning to sell newspapers, and is still in great shape.
The topic of the speech, it seems, is &quot;the protest of the Liberal Democratic Party against the election results in the Amur Region.&quot;
It does not shake the protocols - for there is nothing; Apparently, the Liberal Democratic Party does not have any other protocols besides those signed by the election commissions.
Here he lifts the runner-up Ivan Abramov and shouts something like: &quot;Here is the winner of the elections!&quot;
And then, out of nowhere, he attacks Rodnina, and then, after an altercation with the chairperson, he takes the faction out of the conference room, literally screaming &quot;All of you are swindlers and thieves with your fronts.&quot;
The press, naturally, does not focus on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a result of this scandal and insult.
In reality, Volfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur Region together with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another trick of Zhirinovsky in the style of &quot;Scum!&quot;, And not at all a protest of a political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction formally scandalized, and the elections, according to the party&#39;s website and Ivan Abramov&#39;s Facebook, are not recognized, but the leader is obviously getting off the topic.
He leaves the dead on the Amur to bury their own dead, and he himself preaches the gospel against United Russia as a whole and innocent Rodnina.
An elegant solution, so as not to lose face, and not to go into a real, not ostentatious scandal.
Another thing is that now Abramov himself is in a strange position.
Apart from screams from the authorities, he did not wait for anything, there are no alternative protocols on hand.
He is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other hand, for a narrow circle it was he who became a formal reason both for insulting the respected champion, and, even more abruptly, for boorish attacks on United Russia and ONF.
And then he, of course, needs to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, politician number 2 in the region and candidate number 1 for the only regional single-mandate constituency, he can turn into a pariah who was successfully used by his own party leadership and a super-irritant for the very ONF and someone else&#39;s party leadership.
That&#39;s for sure - there would be no Zhirinovsky, he should have been invented and respectfully watched.
Trump has yet to grow and grow before him.
There was news that the Liberal Democratic Party will return to the hall during the next plenary session.
That is, the bathhouse fell out of nothing at all.
The only thing was that I buried Abramov&#39;s theme.
Nice indeed.
&quot;It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe&quot; - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the countries that are home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama&#39;s Compassionate Center for Ethics Research in Oxford, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that in the current circumstances the interests of humanity should be higher than the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate to the situation.
&quot;It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,&quot; he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria&#39;s response to the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“Caring for thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you have to think about durable solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the number of homicides in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems, &quot;he added.
On the subject of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush&#39;s actions in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, saying that the tough US response set off a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is possible through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and this caused unexpected consequences, &quot;said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who swallowed hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
Poison Control Centers in the United States have reported an almost 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who swallowed high-alcohol hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Control Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Control Center, reported cases of hand disinfectants being swallowed by children under 12 years of age from poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
&quot;Children come into contact with these substances more often, and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them are sent to the emergency room,&quot; Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, and some do it to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
Youtube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant liquid as a cheap booze.
The teens reportedly mixed the disinfectant liquid with an alcohol-based mouthwash to create a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smells of the disinfectant.
&quot;The child does not think that it can harm him,&quot; - said Lopez.
Many of the most attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented.
There are hand sanitizers with the smell of strawberry, grape, orange, which are very attractive to children.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, just a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
&quot;This is a high concentration alcohol,&quot; Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician of the poison control center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn&#39;t just leave a shot of whiskey, but people keep these hand sanitizers in plain sight, and if kids get to them, it&#39;s a quick way to drink large amounts of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed about four sprays of strawberry-flavored hand sanitizer at school, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
She had a blood alcohol level of 179, double that of an adult legally drunk, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, the emergency physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta. ...
Naija was confused and unable to walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors watched her overnight in a separate children&#39;s clinic to watch out for any signs of brain injury as she fell and hit her head due to alcohol, Ritchie said.
&quot;It was very scary,&quot; Ortoria Scott, Naigi&#39;s mother, told CNN.
It could very well be fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic agents or sanitizing wipes in addition to keeping hand sanitizers out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids have been linked to death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a disinfectant containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York conspired to poison their &quot;nasty&quot; teacher by &quot;spreading antibacterial agents in the classroom,&quot; according to a police report.
The teacher is severely allergic to hand sanitizers and has forbidden them to be kept in her class.
Police believe the failed plan was &quot;empty talk&quot; and are addressing disciplinary issues to the school district.
As the oldest children&#39;s library in Barnaul, it has become a family club.
On the back of a bench at the entrance to the regional children&#39;s library. N.K. Krupskaya sad cast-iron owl.
The kids who come for books are trying to feed her with sweets.
For several generations, he has been visiting this library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twenties of the last century arranged loud readings here, staged performances based on Mayakovsky&#39;s poems, held literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin&#39;s wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper Yuny Stalinets wrote in 1939, every day &quot;the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and the friends of the children&#39;s library in the city of Barnaul&quot; grew stronger and stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even once sent her childhood photograph to distant Barnaul friends.
And when the residents of Barnaul asked if Nadezhda Konstantinovna would object to the library being named after her, she wrote that no, she did not mind.
Letters have been gathering dust in the museum for a long time, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose stern profile adorns the bas-relief on the library building.
During the years of perestroika, various people often called, indignant: why the children&#39;s library is not being renamed?
Let there be a library named after some good children&#39;s writer, without political overtones!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
&quot;Krupskaya&quot; is, perhaps, the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as &quot;Lenin&quot; in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby is a yellow brick walkway.
&quot;The Wizard of the Emerald City&quot; is the favorite theme of the artist Olya Moskovka.
Previously, Olya was a manager in a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and differed from all other managers only in her love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet: &quot;I need an illustrator for a book.&quot;
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called &quot;My Cancer Mommy&quot; - &quot;My mother has cancer.&quot;
Olya made illustrations and thought: life can end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it if you do not create them yourself.
Now she works in a library, illustrates children&#39;s books by writers around the world and composes fairy tales herself.
Traditionally, it is believed that children are losing interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some kind of virtual space ...
But reading children come to us, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, - says the director of the library, Tatiana Kushvid, to Russkaya Planet.
In recent years, we even had such a moment of confidence that the children&#39;s library is needed and it will live - the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is returning.
In the lobby of the library, there is a large exhibition stained glass window with a renewable photographic exposition.
Once a quarter, new photos of readers who go to the library with the whole family: mom, dad and children are posted.
People in the library are glad that dads have begun to come with children more and more often.
If at two years old a child was read all of Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs more complicated books.
But now there is a law according to which an eight-year-old prodigy is prohibited from issuing books from the 12+ category.
To get such a book, a child must bring his parents with him - they come, then come back again, and gradually Krupskaya becomes for them something like a family club.
There are treasures in the library - a pre-revolutionary collection of epics with yatas and eras, stories by Korolenko in the supplement to the magazine &quot;Niva&quot;, filing &quot;Murzilki&quot; for 1936.
After all, we are now not only the conceptual space of the &quot;temple of the book&quot;, we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school, ”explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, play, draw together.
We made a play area for toddlers - a child just comes to play, but his hand still reaches for the book!
Some of our readers are carried away by their parents, but they rest on their feet, do not want to leave.
Mothers often come with strollers - and we are pleased that they put the library in the first place among all other places where you need to come with babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says: modern children, just like we once, love classical children&#39;s literature:
&quot;Publishing is developing now, and a lot of attention is paid to authors who are the link between generations.&quot;
And if we talk about little children, then it is important for them that there is some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don&#39;t like to part with their heroes.
The library constantly produces booklets for parents, in which it tells what is happening in modern children&#39;s literature, which books should be paid attention to and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that even adults are interested, but this library is still not for them.
Adults are not allowed to take books outside the reading room.
This magical privilege is only for children.
... In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement, in the book depository.
The steps will creak under your footsteps - this is a very old time machine.
You meet the book of your childhood like an old friend: hello, it&#39;s good that you and I are not changing.
Ellie still walks merrily along the road paved with yellow bricks, lazy Tolya Ryzhikov steals magic matches, and Malchish-Kibalchish never said the War Secret to the damned bourgeoisie - such is his firm word.
Such books are like passwords, by which you can recognize yours anywhere.
The depository also contains real book rarities - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of epics with yatas and eras.
Or Korolenko&#39;s story in the famous supplement to the Niva magazine.
Or filing &quot;Murzilki&quot; for 1936.
Time has aged the pages, painted them tea-colored.
These publications are no longer issued to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I still dream - I will retire and take up rare children&#39;s books.
But the children, so to speak, will not be inclined to do this: the colors in the old books are not very bright, and the themes ... you open the first page, and there - Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now it seems: why did we all subscribe to this &quot;Pioneer Truth?&quot;
But it was still interesting, - says Galina Ilyasova, head of the book depository, to Russkaya Planeta.
The pages of &quot;Murzilka&quot; have darkened with time.
Galina Vasilievna has been in charge of the book depository all her life.
She knows what color Buratino&#39;s cap is, in what academic year Harry Potter became the captain of the Gryffindor team at the Quidditch Championship, in what situations Carlson uses a muffler for a motor, and who Alisa Selezneva&#39;s father works for.
They pay little for the work of a librarian, and everyone who can live without these rows of books very quickly finds another profession.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, teachers, ministers of the book cult.
They can also be recognized by their smile - it is believed that this is a professional trait of a children&#39;s librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation, this is a professional.
In general, I love children&#39;s books: as a librarian, I like to have them, to stand smoothly and beautifully on the shelves, and I also love to read them, ”says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, science fiction.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations ...
Of course, it seems to me that everything was different in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of everything that happened to me then.
And since I was madly in love with them, it seemed to me that the library is a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sits and reads.
I hope that there will always be books, despite the readers.
And I am glad when our former readers bring their children, or even grandchildren ...
Rumor mill: Celtic has no controversy
Griffiths has denied rumors of disagreement at Celtic after Dale admitted that the Hoops were in a bad position, but he would fix that.
Hearts will protest SCF claims against Neilson, and Warburton fears signing contracts in January that could disrupt team cohesion
Dons increased their lead over Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney&#39;s first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a slight lead over Hamilton at Pittodree, allowing the Dons a five-point lead over Celtic.
Griffiths denies talk of controversy
This sparked rumors of a rift at Celtic, which were quelled by Griffiths, who said he and his teammates were not suffering from any mounting criticism as they prepare to face the Dutch League leaders.
I don&#39;t think that we feel the tension, I think that the players are striving for it.
The Dutch are bored because there are no Scots in the fight for the title - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands national team member Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as they are not competing for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently a spokesman for Ajax, said: &quot;Holland is no longer showing the best moments of Celtic&#39;s games, why?&quot;
This is because there are no Rangers.
People here are talking about more than just the return of the Rangers.
They are talking about the &quot;Old Firm&quot;.
They talk about both teams together, and that&#39;s what interests them.
There is a lot of tension in Old Firm games, and it&#39;s not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
&quot;I will change everything,&quot; Dale said
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was going through difficulties, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change everything.
The defeat at Malmö and, as a result, the exit from the Champions League was soon followed by a loss to 10 players, “Aberdeen”, which is now ahead of five points, occupies the top line of the table.
However, Dale said: &quot;Selitka has had bad periods before and we will come out again.&quot;
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand that this is very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what is happening.
And so do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic&#39;s support because that makes the players so much better.
Staying together is so important now.
Warburton looks forward to January transfers
Despite opinions emerging just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he has identified some of the January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is skeptical of the January campaign, arguing that he doesn&#39;t want to destroy the team&#39;s cohesion.
The former Brentford striker said: &quot;The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.&quot;
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a pre-season period to adapt, which you saw in our own group this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Michu, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at retirement
Swansea striker Michu, linked to Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted that he may leave football after his contract with Swans ends.
The 29-year-old has suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts to confront SFA over Neilson&#39;s claims
“Hearts” were leading 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and they were losing 3-2, but the defender&#39;s red card was later canceled; this is Callum&#39;s third red card canceled in eight months.
Neilson does not backtrack on his words, stating: &quot;I did not question the ethics, I did not comment on the game.&quot;
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tycastle
The stubborn Khybernian player was reprimanded after admitting that he sang an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudy Skatsel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn neighborhood of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh derby at Tyncastle in March 2014.
“It was a derby and it was a spur of the moment,” the striker said, adding: “I can safely say that I had no intention of returning to Tyncastle unless he plays for Celtic.
Donnelly: Tannadis advice is confident in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly says Dundee United&#39;s board remains confident that the management team will make a difference, but agrees that the deterioration on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We&#39;ll get the guys ready to go out again, &quot;Donnelly said.
McInnes is glad he won “ugly” over Hamilton
Derek McInness admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against the Hamilton Assis to secure their seventh league title win in a row, which put them five points above Celtic at the top of the standings thanks to a first-half shot from Adam Rooney ...
McInness said: &quot;There is no team here that has won anything - a cup, or a league championship, who has not won meetings in this way.&quot;
The unemployment rate among Scots is not changing, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is rising
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland&#39;s unemployment rate, 5.9%, was above the UK level of 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with the number of workers now at 2,612,000.
Employment rates for Scotland dropped to 74.0% quarterly, above the 73.5% average for the United Kingdom.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the most recent figures, said: &quot;The government&#39;s long-term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy.&quot;
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over these 12 months we have seen further improvement in the Scottish labor market with higher employment and lower unemployment.
Why I am a witness to the execution in Oklahoma
Today, avoiding legal intervention at a later stage, I will watch a person being executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn&#39;t, I will be sitting in the observation gallery on death row in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The first time this request was made back in January, through a close friend of his, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approached, I became afraid.
So why do this?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more applicants than seats, the results of the grim lottery decide who is chosen.
Oklahoma has cut press seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can not do this.
I will sit with Richard Glossip&#39;s closest friends, and we have developed our own relationship after months of phone calls and one two and a half hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I cannot be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I&#39;ll have to try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the prisoner&#39;s story the way he pleases, gain access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she herself &quot;could have articulated better,&quot; but still believes that I am wrong in what I do.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes glasnost will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, the Huffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I have recorded.
I will not go into details here again.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions following the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of aiding the crime.
But I believe there is a good chance that he is not guilty of murder.
I am firmly convinced that there was not enough evidence for a death sentence.
I believe that his execution was wrong.
And from this angle I will watch him die.
I cannot say that I will be completely objective.
There will be other reporters to turn to for this.
From me you will learn what it is like to watch the person I like die unnecessarily.
Police pursued man persuaded to climb out of the Canning River
A constable from Canning Vale managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River and remain dry himself.
The Perth resident intended to get away from the police, but failed, stuck in muddy water in shallow water a few meters from a police officer trying to &quot;gently coax him ashore.&quot;
Canning Vale police were called in on Tuesday for trespassing in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them by throwing himself into Canning.
But he did not go far.
&quot;He stood in the water and said, &#39;I won&#39;t go out, come on, grab me,&quot; said Sgt. Shandell Castldine.
Constable Lachlan Perkhavets did not really want to get his uniform wet, so he used a safer method - &quot;negotiating with a good policeman.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes people do weird things to try and escape,&quot; says Sgt. Castldine.
The champion footballer Ben Cousins is remembered for this.
In 2006, Cousins drove into a ditch to avoid a police patrol for alcohol testing, and tried to swim across Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but prompted the locals to invent the comic Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody accuses stewards of attempted espionage and threatens to retire from equestrian sport
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria&#39;s stewards of trying to plant a spy in his stable last year and threatened to leave equestrianism immediately.
His target was racing Victoria&#39;s stewards and ethics officers, whom he accused of campaigning against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the start for drug-abuse violations on launch day, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he is always doing his best in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to a positive Lidari test for cobalt, which he cannot explain.
He held his tongue about suspicions of espionage for a year and a half and did not want it to &quot;look like a green grape.&quot;
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I endured it for a long time, but sometimes it unsettles you so much that you can’t hold back,” Moody said.
They know this has been going on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to go through the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
Today I will go home and sleep soundly.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want my owners to know that I am doing my best for them.
When they start to think that this is not so, then I will need to stop being a coach.
Then I&#39;ll have to figure out what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally stated in an interview on racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his stable.
&quot;A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I will name if asked and offered him a job in my stable to convey information about what I was doing in my stable.&quot; stated Moody at Racing.com.
They clearly think I am a fraud.
If so, they should certainly all apply, as their attempt to catch me failed.
Robert Rolston, the former RVL chairman, David Moody, the current RVL chairman, and Bernard Sondry, the current RVL CEO, have known this all the time and they know it now.
Shouldn&#39;t that make me think the case is getting personal?
Shouldn&#39;t RVL have the courage to hold people other than coaches accountable for what&#39;s going on in this business?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I that bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think that this is so.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I am saying now may make them think about it.
But I have now reached the point where I do not care, and it saddens me.
This makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and make them responsible for making a decision.
I have family support and I can leave.
The coach&#39;s frustration only grew during the lengthy investigation into the cobalt and Lidari case, and the latest removal of the horse from the start made him declare that he could &quot;throw his license on the table.&quot;
Moody, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the competition day medication requirements &quot;ludicrous&quot; after a clay compress was applied to a horse&#39;s feet, in violation of the rules.
This is a violation of the rules at the races.
&quot;I have to take full responsibility for this,&quot; he said.
One of my employees mistakenly applied a compress to her leg.
She could have received a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, like she did.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody may be disqualified for three months under the rules on medication on competition day for using a compress, which the stewards have opened an investigation into.
This is an anecdote.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
&quot;We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far,&quot; Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled from the scene in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobram over the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to police in Shepparton.
It is assumed that he will be charged with abandoning the scene, refusing to provide assistance and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in a hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy fends off accusations of violent force against opponents
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called his team&#39;s criticism of the interception as &quot;an imposing agenda&quot; from the two NRL champions.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the officials allowed Storm to “fight” his team during Storm&#39;s surprise win in the final qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear nod to Storm after his team won the final qualifier against Northern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game &quot;typical&quot; of rugby league and said the two from the Queensland squad were not &quot;too successful&quot; in hand-to-hand combat.
Bellamy defended his team&#39;s interception and stated that they were simply focusing on &quot;contact&quot; while intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was encouraged by the criticism of his team from the two top coaches as it means they are worried about a possible defeat at Storm.
&quot;It keeps popping up - I didn&#39;t hear Trent Robinson talk about tough moves when they beat us 24-2,&quot; Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our systems or defense techniques for a whole year, just in the last six weeks we have paid special attention to contacts when intercepting the ball, and this was a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years now and is clearly coaching a great team, so he probably isn&#39;t used to losing and it came as a bit of a shock to him.
It&#39;s funny how it always shows up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett&#39;s idea of &quot;impressive football&quot;, reminding his teacher that Bennett&#39;s &quot;St. George-Illawarra Dragons&quot; won the championship in 2010 playing &quot;boring&quot; football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his performance on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and see how impressive their performance was, &quot;said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010. “St. George” was criticized a lot, calling it a boring team, and Wayne said that he did not care at all.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
This is football that you would want to play when you have such players.
He made that remark in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play football his style - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play that way.
It gives me more confidence, because they say these things, because they are somewhat worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn&#39;t think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that Storm and Roosters &#39;game was a more points match than the Broncos and Cowboys&#39; games.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven&#39;t seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game, he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is this impressive football?
Or are interruptions and failed attempts impressive?
It&#39;s a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some stage we can meet with them there.
Storm have a day off this weekend as they have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronall Sharks next Saturday night at the AAMI Park preliminary finals, and will go on sale next Tuesday morning ...
Serb accused of drug possession released on $ 200,000 bail
The man, facing life imprisonment for attempting to steal 40 kg of smuggled cocaine into Queensland, was released on $ 200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on Solay, sailing from South America through Vanuatu and docking in Kumera in August.
Throughout the morning, Maksimovich and his accomplices were seen at the pier, and later he met with them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 kg of the drug in a Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maksimovich faces a life sentence for attempting to misappropriate drugs in quantities sufficient for sale, Maksimovich&#39;s lawyer argues that there is no evidence that the latter tried to get the whole consignment, and that the man could have been in the cafe without any intent ...
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maksimovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has connections with Serbia.
He travels frequently to Serbia, &quot;he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovich&#39;s mother and stepfather were asked to post a joint bond of $ 200,000 for his release.
&quot;From the testimony of both, it becomes clear that the $ 200,000 bail is too much of a financial burden for them,&quot; said Justice Flanagan.
But this measure alone is not enough to guarantee that he will not disappear, the judge added.
Maksimovich was allowed to be released on bail, provided that he surrendered both his Australian and Serbian passports, that he would be reported to the police every day and observe a curfew from 6 pm to 6 am.
Fotis Katsikaris: &quot;I am proud of the Greek national team, which fought until the last seconds.&quot;
The head coach of the Greek national team Fotis Katsikaris paid tribute to his team after the quarterfinal match of Eurobasket 2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was decided by individual mistakes.
It was a great game, - quotes AFP Katsikaris.
We were preparing for a great game played by the Spaniards.
We tried to work out in defense, but mistakes in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It&#39;s sad, but I&#39;m proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: &quot;At CSKA I will be responsible for Kaun&#39;s functions.&quot;
CSKA rookie Joel Freeland said that he did not believe in the curse of the army.
The Briton also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I talked to coach Dimitris Itoudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, - quotes &quot;R-Sport&quot; Freeland. - In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in defensive formations and in the attack from the three-second zone, and I think I can handle this.
Yes, it will take me some time to rebuild to the center position, after all, in the NBA I played more of a forward.
Now it will be necessary to confront the big centers of the rival more, but I have already done this before, so I think I can handle it now.
CSKA last won the Euroleague in 2008.
Since then, they have made it to the Final Four six times, but each time they have failed to show their best basketball.
There is an opinion that someone jinxed the team.
This is the whole game, you can&#39;t win forever.
Of course, this is difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we are capable of, then we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the evil eye, I am not a superstitious person and do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine the two, anything is possible.
I don&#39;t have any specific rituals before games either, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: &quot;The match against Roma will be special for me.&quot;
The head coach of Barcelona Luis Enrique did not hide the fact that he returned to Rome for the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group stage with Roma with special feelings.
According to the mentor, a face-to-face duel between his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique coached the “wolves” in the 2011/12 season, but failed to show his best side in the Italian capital.
I returned to Rome after a few years, during which I gained some experience. - quotes the official website of UEFA, the words of Luis Enrique. -
I have extremely fond memories of Rome.
It will be a special game for me, but it is not that important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with a victory.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the teams&#39; actions in the next match.
I expect Roma to play the game they showed in Serie A against Juventus.
They are a strong team that knows how to apply pressure and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: Krasnodar has various options for attacking actions. &quot;
Acting head coach of “Ural” Vadim Skripchenko on the eve of the match of the 9th round of the Premier League with “Krasnodar” noted the variety of attacking schemes of the opposing team.

The fight will take place on September 21 and will start at 16.30 Moscow time.
How we will play with Krasnodar, we&#39;ll see, - quotes the official site of Ural as Skripchenko&#39;s words.
We have a whole week of preparation ahead of us.
This team has various options for attacking actions, carries out its attacks in various ways, at the same time, we are not a slow team, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
On the eve of this game, given that Krasnodar is holding the Europa League match against Borussia Dortmund, we will try to prepare very well to win.
Roher Kanyas: &quot;At home, Astana can take points away from anyone.&quot;
Astana midfielder Roher Kanyas, after the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group stage with Benfica (0: 2), expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team&#39;s play in the future.
According to the midfielder, Astana players are able to take points from any opponent in their field.
Despite the fact that the match turned out to be difficult for us, I can say that we played well, ”the official UEFA website quotes Cañas as saying. - We lacked a little courage in the attack.
Benfica are higher class, but at home, I think we can count on taking points away from them.
It’s quite real.
But first you need to think about Galatasaray and then Atlético.
In home matches, we can take points from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: &quot;I will repeat as many times as I like: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world.&quot;
Real Madrid head coach Rafael Benitez expressed satisfaction with a major victory in the Champions League group stage 1 match against Shakhtar (4: 0).
The specialist paid tribute to the striker Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the author of three goals.
The match was not easy, because Shakhtar know how to own the ball, - quotes the official UEFA website as saying Benitez.
The opponent did not have many chances, but their counterattacks are always fraught with danger.
I will not say that “Real” played perfectly, but we had plenty of chances to score.
I am happy that we didn’t concede goals and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
This is the best player in the world, I will say that as many times as I want.
Jordi Alba: &quot;Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be compared with Messi.&quot;
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes that his team-mate Lionel Messi cannot be matched by anyone.
According to the Spaniard, Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo cannot do this either.
Messi is five goals higher than the rest, - quoted by Le Figaro Alba. “What Leo can do, no one can.
Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
Everything changes with Leo on the pitch, I can&#39;t compare him with anyone else.
Daniele De Rossi: Barcelona not only has a unique style, but also a strong personality.
Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi on the eve of the Champions League group stage match with Barcelona noted the importance of compactness and safety net in the game with such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, beginning at 21.45 Moscow time.
Let&#39;s remind, &quot;SE&quot; will carry out its text broadcast.
“Barcelona” is a special rival, a good team with great players, - quotes the official website of UEFA De Rossi. -
It is difficult to play with blue garnet, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.
To keep them, we will have to plow throughout the match and hedge each other.
Messi is almost always successful when he strokes, so we need to keep it compact and organized.
Yezhov hopes to be in the starting lineup of SKA in the match against Slovan.
SKA goalkeeper Ilya Yezhov stressed that he hopes to be in the starting lineup of the army team in the next match of the KHL championship.
Yezhov went on the ice instead of Mikko Koskinen in the 23rd minute with the score 0: 3 and saved all the shots on his own goal, SKA conceded the fourth goal after replacing the goalkeeper with the sixth field player.
The team will play the next match away against Slovan.
I hope that I will qualify for the next match in the starting lineup, - quotes R-Sport as saying Yezhov.
I am not an expert on goalkeepers, I am a goalkeeper myself, we do not show replays of conceded goals, so it is difficult to track.
Dynamo played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team lost anyway.
I would have missed more, but the team won.
Shafarzhova was hospitalized with a viral infection.
Lucy Shafarzhova has been hospitalized with a bacterial infection, AFP reports.
At the moment, the Czech tennis player is in a clinic in Brno.
The timing of the restoration of the finalist of Roland Garros-2015 is still unknown.
Let&#39;s also remind that on Monday, Shafarzhova moved up one line in the WTA ranking and is now the fifth racket in the world.
Stephen Hogg used the girl&#39;s phone to force pedophiles to send photos
The pedophile used the 11-year-old girl&#39;s phone to solicit images of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl&#39;s phone while she was sleeping, logged into an online messaging service, where he received a series of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, discovered the missing phone and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photographs, after which she immediately drew the attention of her mother.
The police arrived and saw five images, then searched the computers found at that address and found &quot;matching&quot; searches using words to find obscene images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he did it because it would &quot;attract pedophiles&quot; and then he would &quot;pretend he was a cop to scare them.&quot;
Bailiff Eilid Robertson told the Dundee sheriff&#39;s court: “He said it was addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted to making inquiries on a computer, but stated that it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to scare the pedophiles.
He was questioned about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him the images and that he asked for more photos.
He said he was doing this to lure them in.
He said he had problems with his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: “When the little girl found the pictures on her phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw obscene images on the phone, and then a confrontation was held with the accused.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the defendant had used the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making obscene photographs of children on June 14 last year, breaking the terms of bail on January 25 this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defendant&#39;s lawyer Gregor Sim asked not to include Hogg on the list of sexual offenders, as it can be shown that there was no &quot;significant sexual element&quot; in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred his sentence until October, pending a release from social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was remanded in custody pending hearings in the other remaining cases.
He was included in the list of perpetrators of sexual crimes even before the date of the sentencing.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gives the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa&#39;s oldest statesman, fell off the podium stairs earlier this year.
He was not hurt, but the video with the scene of the fall instantly spread across social networks.
The opening of the parliament was also overshadowed by statements by parliamentary oppositionists that they received anonymous threats warning them against booing Mugabe while delivering the address.
A month ago, they booed the president during his address to the nation in parliament; it was this speech that Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change MP Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning not to interrupt Mugabe&#39;s speech.
&quot;The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled Death,&quot; he told reporters at the end of Mugabe&#39;s speech.
It warned noted members of parliament that immunity ends in the parliament building, and once they leave, parliamentary immunity is invalid.
The MP said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is &quot;worried&quot; about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting program for services.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies, separating the computer and printer industry from the faster-growing hardware and service sectors.
Contributions from the estimated job cuts will be approximately US $ 2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
&quot;This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,&quot; said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, which will lead the organization after the split.
&quot;Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard currently, and the portfolio of business lines will be broader and deeper to help the company transition to a new business style,&quot; Whitman said.
As a standalone company, we are in a better position than before to meet the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have more than $ 50 billion in annual revenues and &quot;will focus on providing previously unattainable end-to-end technology solutions&quot; to companies, the company said in a statement.
This splits the company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University alumni Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto has been nicknamed &quot;the birthplace of Silicon Valley.&quot;
Hewlett Packard is in the midst of a major reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world&#39;s second-largest personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in the United States, is the latest development in the sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies are doing better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates should support injured Jack Wilshire ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
In a conversation with Wilshire, Wenger also stressed that it was only September and that, provided that Wilshire&#39;s recovery goes according to plan, then nothing will prevent him from returning to the game by Christmas.
In the best possible development, Wilshire will definitely miss at least four of the next games in England and, given what has happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer is in question.
The worst part about this recent issue is that Wilshire finished the previous season with a single ankle injury and was about to return to his usual aggressive playstyle during preseason.
Wenger: &quot;This injury does not threaten his career.&quot;
It&#39;s just a bone that isn&#39;t completely healed.
Nothing serious.
It&#39;s just an accident.
It is not related to the ankles or injuries that he has had in the past.
These may be medically related things, but as Wenger also admitted, there is an associated risk of additional injury for any player returning to the game mid-season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has recorded 23 different injuries in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he has played in only 65 of Arsenal&#39;s 157 league games in the past five seasons.
Looking more broadly at Arsenal, you can see that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, Arsenal have been one of the two Premier League clubs with the most injured days.
Wenger acknowledges the likelihood of being stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the injury statistics will continue to improve over the past season.
“Sometimes, when you come back from injury, you’re vulnerable for a while — during that time, you need to recuperate and gain a competitive edge,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to handle.
I hope that he will recover physically, I am confident of this, as well as that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal kick off the Champions League campaign on Wednesday with Dynamo Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, with Wenger looking to rotate the roster.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will most likely play in the starting lineup.
Perhaps Wenger will also add Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud to replace Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
“I try to keep the balance and give a little breathing room to those players who need it,” said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are the undisputed favorites in Group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost any of their 41 games since they managed last season as the Invincibles.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal have learned the lesson they learned last season when the team were defeated in a Champions League game against Monaco, and remain with little hope of leading the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
&quot;It&#39;s an incredible drive,&quot; Wenger said.
Arsenal have never done this before.
We were very close to our goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I am a long-time realist.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that taught us some serious lessons in male friendship
The lack of such stories is striking, especially when you consider how desperate men&#39;s need for frankness has become, now more than ever, with the suicide rate among young men at their highest in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the single largest cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, with men three times more likely than women.
In an attempt to address the issue, the Campaign Against Unhappy Life has declared 2015 the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to rise to this challenge.
A recent study of over 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a large enough number of friends “in a normal mood,” the chances of a cure are doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, having a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the chance of mental distress.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all, it must be there.
In an era when communication is driven by social media, where style is preferred over content, speed of response is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to appear strong, fun-loving, and successful, even though the reality is loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our internal desire for personal growth and friendship, which more strongly affects our mental health.
And as one billionaire video game maker recently pointed out, money doesn&#39;t actually buy more happiness.
The good thing about Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each of the characters was defined not through their work, but rather through the personality that manifested itself in communication with friends.
Joey&#39;s humor and Chandler&#39;s constant hugs, moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross sighing for Rachel - all come from the understanding that men can feel this, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As a Samaritans employee told me: &quot;... my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal emphasizes how even the smallest communication of friends can be beneficial.&quot;
Often those men who turn to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old doctrine of &quot;live with it&quot; is strong, as is the feeling that talking frankly about problems might be perceived as weakness. &quot;
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to come up with more lasting coping mechanisms.
It highlighted subtle moments of male friendship.
As for my task, being a stranger on the phone helps people in times of despair, while long-term support comes from the inner circle of family and friends.
So, if you&#39;re attending FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the scenery has been completely restored for the party, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or better yet, if you see a lonely person at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
Don&#39;t guess in advance what kind of benefit friendship can bring.

Di Maria scores a goal helping PSG defeat Malmo
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani, celebrates the goals scored against Malmö.
Angel di Maria made his Champions League debut with a goal that allowed PSG to easily beat Malmö on Tuesday.
Here is the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their part when Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League game with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after starting his first Champions League game as a PSG player to give direction to the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a goal in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, Pari needed to get off to a good start against the Swedish champions as they were aiming not to qualify for the playoffs, but to continue their successful streak of the past three seasons where they made it to the quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in attack and later replace him on the field in a game against a team from his hometown and the club in which he began his brilliant career in 1999 ...
“It’s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so winning 2-0, giving your opponents a problem and playing well on defense is a good start, even if there are still things we need to work on over the course of season, &quot;Blanc said.
This is promising.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I wish we had scored one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury on a substitution for the Paris side that earned them a 2-2 draw against Bordeaux in the First League over the weekend, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker has been singled out for taking PSG to the next level in Europe after being bought out from Manchester United last month and proving why when he ran out for a pass from Marco Verratti behind Malmo&#39;s defense and finished the attack beautifully, sending the ball past Johan Villand into the far corner of the goal.
However, if someone expected then from “PSG” an easy and big victory, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in the playoffs to reach this stage, with nine world-class players on the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two defensive midfielders in the middle of the field, were formidable opponents.
But, with the exception of Nikola Djurdzic&#39;s kick, in which the ball flew past the far post of Kevin Trapp&#39;s goal in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
But “PSG” at times let itself down with ineffective passes and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who in the first half could not realize at least five attempts, and then could not handle the ball, scored by Cavani immediately after the resumption of the game.
However, he proved to be much more skillful at accurate passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, which, received, Di Maria sent the ball in a twisted shot that went right up to the post past Wieland in 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scoring his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic tweaked a ball sent into midfield from the left flank by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas Malmö had for a return to the game, and only a close-range interception by Wieland prevented David Luis from increasing the final score before substitute Ezequiel Lavessi was denied a goal at the very end of the match.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, with the Norwegian saying: &quot;Our last Champions League game was in December last year.&quot;
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, and this is not the same level.
Qualification is not enough.
Glory to &quot;Pari&quot;!
It was a wonderful match with them.
Glencore makes $ 2.5 billion from stock sales
Switzerland-based mining and trading giant Glencore, hit by lower commodity prices, raised $ 2.5 billion from share sales as part of its ambitious plan to reduce debt.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, has announced that it has sold approximately £ 1.6 billion in new shares to pay off debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value, is struggling to cope with the collapse in commodity prices as the downturn in China is hurting demand and creating chaos in global markets.
Glencore&#39;s stock price soared in early Wednesday morning trading on the London Stock Exchange, thanks to the new share issue at a preferential price.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100, which traded 0.69 percent higher at the opening.
Glencore last week began selling $ 2.5 billion in shares as part of an ambitious plan to cut its $ 30 billion in debt by about a third.
The company was selling new shares at 125 cents apiece, a 2.4 percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday.
It placed 1.3 billion new shares, which is 9.99 percent of the company&#39;s authorized capital.
Due to concerns about the continued downturn in the Chinese economy, the cost of iron ore has dropped by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials have fallen in price by 20-40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping&#39;s visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official statement that Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive on an official visit to the United States later this month.
The visit - Xi Qinping&#39;s first visit to Washington - will take place on September 25 and will be a return visit to President Barack Obama&#39;s visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan at a government dinner on the evening of the same day after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
&quot;The visit of President Xi Jinping will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on general, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, and will also allow the presidents of the United States and China to constructively address controversial issues,&quot; the statement said.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with executives from several of America&#39;s leading technology companies en route to Washington, then travel to New York to attend the September UN General Assembly.
Obama and Xi Jingping are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington&#39;s concerns over alleged cyber espionage by China and China&#39;s growing categoricality on the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

The BMW car, which was driven by Mirzoyev, crossed the oncoming lane and knocked down a motorcyclist standing on the side of the road.
From his injuries, a man born in 1989 died on the spot.
Friends of the deceased on social networks reported that the BMW driver was driving at high speed and drove into the oncoming lane before the accident.
Fearing that the driver would try to evade responsibility, the bikers organized a motorcycle rally from Vorobyovy Gory to the building of the GUMVD of Moscow on Petrovka, 38.
Soon after, it became known that the investigation, following the interrogation, detained the alleged perpetrator of the accident.
In Moscow, they detained a naked man who entered the temple.

Law enforcers waited for doctors from the emergency psychiatric team and handed over the man to them.
It turned out to be a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
More than 40 decisions and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tyumen Region Vladimir Yakushev at a meeting of the regional government presidium.
Some of them concerned the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, funds were allocated for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools in the Nizhny Novgorod region, for the overhaul of the regional hospital in the Kazan region.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the overhaul of the second floor of the therapeutic department.
Repair of hot and cold water supply networks, sewerage systems, power grids and electrical equipment, ventilation systems will be carried out, the facade of the building will be put in order, the premises will be repaired, a set of measures for fire safety and energy saving will be carried out.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will take place in Sochi.
On September 17-18, Sochi will host the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus, in which the Tyumen delegation headed by the governor will take part.
Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen Vladimir Shuglya, who is part of the official delegation, talks about the upcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of cooperation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what tasks does the Sochi forum pose?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is built on fruitful cooperation between regions - important links in relations between the two states.
It is planned that the plenary session will be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko.
Within the framework of plenary and breakout sessions, the discussion will focus on the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, regulatory support and programs of the Union State.
The Governor of the Tyumen Region will speak at the forum.
I think this testifies to the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
The forum will also be attended by representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will work, including those from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk in June last year.
More than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, took part in its work.
At the same time, a very important agreement on cooperation was signed between the Tyumen and Minsk regions.
The importance of our developments is also evidenced by the fact that a meeting of a permanent seminar at the parliamentary meeting of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen.
In addition, the delegation of the agro-industrial complex of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus in order to study the experience of Belarusians in training personnel for agriculture, identify additional points of contact and organize new investment projects in the agricultural sector.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tyumen Region, Vladimir Yakushev, the sides discussed cooperation between the region and the Republic of Belarus in today&#39;s difficult conditions.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural equipment and the use of financial mechanisms are touched upon - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the end user.
Problems in the operation of the Tyumen trading house &quot;Belshina&quot; and options for preventing losses were discussed.
The issues are important, since investment projects must work well and bring profit to the region.
They talked about further deliveries of passenger and cargo vehicles of MAZ OJSC, development of the MAZ OJSC service center, which was created in Tyumen on the basis of TPATP OJSC.
The conversation also touched upon the preparation of the trip of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of this year.
Another topic of the conversation was the completion of the agreement and the signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promises to reach a new level.
These questions also concerned the regional center.
During a meeting with the head of the Tyumen city administration, Alexander Moor, we talked about updating the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already &quot;on fire&quot;, so a new batch of cars from Belarus is required, which will run on natural gas.
One more aspect: Tyumen Elevator Plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products OJSC &quot;Mogilevliftmash&quot;, receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the programs for the installation of new elevators in the regional center.
I will add that within the framework of the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing trade and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment in the Trans-Urals was discussed.
A meeting with the Omsk governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The extended consular district includes five constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of district headquarters.
The region is a testing ground for many promising projects, including the work of the honorary consul general.
In general, such meetings are significant and good because they allow you to directly and quickly solve many problems, removing their urgency and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current conditions, it is extremely important not to destroy the groundwork while continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon opposes focusing on ethnic diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon argued with African American producer Effie Brown, stating behind the scenes that ethnicity should not be considered.
During the Sunday episode of HBO&#39;s Project Greenlight, the acclaimed actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative perspectives on the black female lead in the script she chose for the project.
&quot;Diversity is appropriate when you&#39;re casting for the movie itself, not for the show,&quot; Damon insisted.
Dumbfounded Brown, in disbelief, exclaimed resentfully &quot;Wow! Wow. Well, well&quot; all the time while the actor from &quot;The Martian&quot; was giving comments on the air.
Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelli brothers to discuss the show&#39;s finalists.
&quot;I would like the participants - no matter who the director is - to think about what interpretation of Harmony they are going to adhere to,&quot; Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white pimp.
Dear White People has produced Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio to direct the film; Damon was strongly opposed, saying that &quot;in the end we may not get what we want.&quot;
After this discussion was shown on television, social media exploded with disapproving comments about Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni spoke angrily about the video featured: &quot;Matt Damon&#39;s explanation of diversity to the only black person in the room IS WHITE it hurts.&quot;
The tweet received over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon&#39;s remarks appear just when competent media coverage of racial issues is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public discussion.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was gunned down by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained traction across the country, urging lawmakers and government officials to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince mentioned the move when nominating Album of the Year nominees at the Grammy Awards.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Most recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck if the group would be viewed as a hate group.
&quot;The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,&quot; said the leaders of the movement.
Recently it was announced that Damon is on the list of show business figures, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met with the Pope.
&quot;American Ninja Warrior&quot; awards the first champion
Professional climber and assistant waiter Isaac Caldiero became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night, taking home a $ 1 million prize.
At this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants has yet managed to complete all the stages of the obstacle course.
In the season finale, two contestants, Caldiero and cameraman Jeff Britten, made it to the final round.
The final challenge involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task first and met the target time, becoming the first athlete in American Ninja Warrior history to complete the grueling Stage 4, but Caldiero completed the task a full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After winning with incredible difficulty, Caldiero, who was shocked by the fact that he won a million dollars, was interviewed by &quot;E! News&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s incredible to think about it, I have never earned or lived on more than $ 10,000 a year,&quot; Isaac commented to E! such a significant jump in their income.
And suddenly this ... I never even imagined how it happens ... the future is unknown.
Executive Producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the finals and why Britten, who finished first, won&#39;t receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the fastest participant gets the money.
&quot;If there are more than one finishing player, the fastest player gets the prize,&quot; Weed said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life-changing, he still gets immense satisfaction.
I don&#39;t think he feels offended about this.
He is happy with what he did.
It has received tons of rave reviews from fans.
He is a wonderful person and a family man.
He is a hero to his children and wife.
Jeff told me, &quot;If I was destined to lose to someone, I&#39;m glad it&#39;s Isaac.&quot;
And I think Isaac would feel the same if we switched roles.
America Ninja Warrior will return with an eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
Detrot Tigers quietly bypass Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams once, the Tigers are now last in the American League Center Division.
Claiming to be a nuisance, the Tigers brilliantly beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins missed out on a chance to cut half a game back from the Houston Astros and finish second in the playoffs on points behind the winners.
For Detroits, even for one night, it was the return of the F word that had eluded them for most of the second half of the season.
&quot;All wins are fun, no matter how they come out,&quot; said Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon did his part to support the attacks, which saw Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then added another in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and conceded three runs.
This was only his third quality start in nine exits.
“I just want to end the year with a good performance,” Simon said.
Substitution pitchers fail to throw in every game and so I want to get deeper into the game.
Nominated Tigers slugger Victor Martinez hit three hits and hit two wounds - his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was the first three-hit day since four hits against the Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
&quot;He did a good job as a bat,&quot; Osmus said.
He performed well in (as a batter), noticeably better at bat and retained this quality for the game.
With three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center host Byron Buxton opened the inning with a double on the left line of the field.
Rightfielder Aaron Hicks bowed to first base and second baseman Brian Dozier was struck out on a swing by Simon before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy passed Moer, the only player on the way, ahead of new designated batter, Miguel Sano, who knocked out a two-run single to the left of right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of runners out of touch and a comparing wound at second base, VerHagen managed to lead third baseman Trevor Pluff to double play.
It was the 27th time for a major league top player this season that Pluff knocked the ball out for a double play.
After Detroit added a safety net in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned an RBI double into the space between outfielders against Tigers closing pitcher Bruce Rondon to make the score 5-4.
However, the right-handed player knocked out Sano after three strikes and got his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily out-of-practice Phil Hughes early in the game.
The Tigers had three wounds in the first two innings against the well-deserved pitcher, who was on the injury list prior to the game, having been away for over a month due to lower back inflammation.
&quot;Definitely not the start I wanted,&quot; Hughes said, &quot;but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots in the third inning.&quot;
After the first batter made it to first base, Hughes threw a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Walk on two strikeouts by rightfielder J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez out, who made a single in the middle for the first shot of the game.
Victor Martinez ended his streak &quot;0 for 21&quot; with the runners in an effective position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed up with a single, bringing another wound, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to get closer to third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
The Tigers tied up in the second inning with a one-strike double from catcher James McCann and a two-strike single from center slugger Anthony Goes to make it 3-0.
&quot;It was a huge hit,&quot; said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He wasn&#39;t particularly good at hitting, but he hit right on the right spot.
Hughes, whose shots were counted, shot in the unscored third inning, after which he was replaced by right-handed relay A.J. Akhter.
Hughes was counted three wounds on six hits and a walk with four strike-outs.
NOTES: Tigers right-hander pitcher Anibal Sanchez has been eliminated with a sprained right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed shoulder surgery on Sanchez back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to start on Wednesday.
In Sanchez&#39;s absence, left-handed reliever Daniel Norris will be off the injury list to face the Twins.
Norris, who has left the Tigers in four starts since his acquisition in exchange for left-handed pitcher David Price on July 30, has 1 win and 1 loss.
He has not participated in games since 20 August due to an oblique strain.
The Tigers and Twins will complete a three-game streak at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will be played by right-handed pitcher Erwin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
The original of Kadyrov&#39;s complaint about the book &quot;A Prayer to God&quot; was submitted to the Yuzhno-Sakhalin court.
The Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Court received the original of the appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, against the decision to recognize the book &quot;A Prayer to God: Its Significance and Place in Islam&quot; as &quot;extremist material,&quot; Interfax reports, citing the chairman of the city court, Alexander Chukhrai.
Now the court is awaiting possible objections from the participants in the process.
Chukhrai refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation about the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign special services and ISIS.
“Let them comment on such nonsense themselves,” he said.
On September 11, the Yuzhno-Sakhalin City Prosecutor&#39;s Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalya Perchenko to recognize the book as &quot;extremist material.&quot;
The prosecutor&#39;s office in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk received an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor&#39;s office believes that they asked the court to recognize as extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, and not the verses from the Koran.
According to the prosecutor&#39;s office, the judge made the wrong decision, &quot;Chukhrai said.
The decision to recognize the book as &quot;extremist material&quot; was made on August 12, 2015.
In particular, quotations from the Koran were called &quot;extremist&quot; - &quot;We worship you and we pray for your help&quot;, &quot;Do not appeal to anyone along with Allah.&quot;
Kadyrov called those who made the decision on the book &quot;shaitans and provocateurs.&quot;
He urged State Duma deputies to legally prohibit court decisions concerning the texts of the scriptures.
&quot;I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should pass a law, according to which it is prohibited to make judicial decisions concerning directly the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures,&quot; Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments insulting migrants and refugees
Employees of &quot;Facebook&quot; intend to delete posts and comments that give a negative assessment of migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
The leadership of Facebook intends to fight against manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network together with the German Ministry of Justice.
So, on the eve, the head of the department, Heiko Maas, said that the Ministry of Justice, together with specialists from the social network, is creating a special group of moderators.
Its members are obliged to track and delete comments that are inappropriate in relation to migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, authors of intolerant posts are expected to receive notifications stating the reason for deleting their post.
Organizations whose specialists collect complaints about offensive posts from users of the social network should also contribute to the prompt blocking of illegal content.
The Facebook management intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements about migrants and refugees was made by the leadership of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice after xenophobic sentiments rose sharply in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented scale of the migration crisis that gripped the EU countries some time ago.
So, in Germany today all the points intended for the accommodation of refugees are overcrowded.
On the eve of the country&#39;s authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced migrants from the countries of the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks in which prisoners and prisoners of war were kept under the Nazi regime.
Relaxation zones will appear in Moscow cemeteries.
In the near future, several metropolitan cemeteries will be equipped with specialized zones for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be the Butovskoye, Domodedovskoye, and Shcherbinskoye cemeteries.
The first zone for psychological relaxation has already appeared at the Troekurovsky cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar sites will appear in other areas of the city.
Artem Yekimov, who is the head of the State Budgetary Institution &quot;Ritual&quot;, told about this to the portal m24.ru.
The relaxation areas will be small green areas that resemble parks.
According to experts, in such &quot;corners&quot; visitors to cemeteries will be able to relax, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in the Domodedovsky, Butovsky and Shcherbinsky cemeteries, and then in other districts of the capital.
According to the head of the State Budgetary Institution &quot;Ritual&quot;, if the need arises to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest areas as much as possible.
Green spaces will serve as a living fence that will separate recreation areas and areas set aside directly for burial sites.
Experts of the State Budgetary Institution &quot;Ritual&quot; also announced their intention to make a proposal to abandon the hedges at the burial grounds.
New cemeteries can indeed become barrier-free.
In addition, the State Budgetary Institution &quot;Ritual&quot; spoke about their readiness to start installing electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors to cemeteries can find out the GPS coordinates and license plates of the burials.
In June of this year, the State Budgetary Institution &quot;Ritual&quot; also proposed to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the season.
So, digging a grave in the summer will cost a thousand rubles less, weeks in winter, when the ground is frozen.
Note that over the past year, prices for all types of funeral services have risen by an average of 10 percent.
Five days later, a mushroom picker was found lost in the Elna forests.
The elderly man turned out to be alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest more often without provisions.
It was possible to find the would-be mushroom picker thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: &quot;A 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest.&quot;
No food or water.
Relatives, rescuers, volunteers were looking for him.
There were even dog handlers with dogs, but there was no result.
It was possible to find the man after a helicopter was connected to the search work.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went into the forest for mushrooms and boletus, but did not return by evening.
The relatives immediately asked for help, and the very next day, rescuers and concerned residents from the neighboring village were raised in search of the mushroom picker - about 30 people in total.
On the fifth day, they were joined by a helicopter from the fire and rescue center.
Andrey Seletkov, head of the search and rescue group of the firefighting and rescue center of the Smolensk region, said: &quot;The helicopter was attracted, the man was found.&quot;
Gone very far, in a completely different place.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He walked a great distance at his age.
Miraculously survived.
The mushroom picker was taken to the Yelninsk central regional hospital unconscious, in an extremely serious condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia.
How an elderly man was able to survive after five days in the forest, doctors have absolutely no idea.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Yelninsk Central Regional Hospital: &quot;The patient has been scheduled for examination, treatment.&quot;
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all his chronic illnesses.
The patient&#39;s condition improved in the morning, remains grave, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Aleksandrovich comes to the Smolensk region from the Tambov region every year.
His grandson says that his grandfather went to pick mushrooms before, but he never went deep into the forest.
Alexey Spitchenko, the grandson of the found mushroom picker, shared: &quot;The forest not far from the road, itself, in principle, is not local.&quot;
Literally for several years he came to visit, to stay with relatives.
Well, and went for mushrooms.
Apparently, he went too far and got lost.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
In the last few days alone, there are five similar cases.
Rescuers remind: you need to walk into the forest in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches and a compass.
In addition, it is advisable to leave traces behind, so that later you can go back.
Emergency An-2 landed on a clearing in the fraternal taiga.
An emergency An-2 landed right on a clearing in Siberia.
The plane of the Krasnoyarsk airline &quot;Yenisei&quot; made an emergency landing 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no fatalities or injuries, but the plane itself received significant damage upon landing.
An-2 made a business flight.
There were three crew members on board - the commander, the co-pilot and the flight mechanic, Interfax reports.
The emergency plane was flying on the route Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsky - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The aircraft crew has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The Bratsk Transport Prosecutor&#39;s Office, after the emergency landing of the An-2, began checking compliance with the legislation on flight safety.
The investigative group of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor&#39;s Office left for the scene.
In September 2010, the crew of the Tu-154 landed their plane with passengers due to a technical malfunction at an abandoned taiga airfield in Komi.
The engines and onboard electronics failed on the liner, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured during the emergency landing.
Vesti Ekonomika - Nobel laureate: globalization
Print The processes of globalization were supposed to help reduce inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different; the difference in incomes of the population in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Muskin.
To fix this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, says Eric Maskin, chief researcher at the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision Choice at the Higher School of Economics, Nobel Prize laureate in economics 2007.
In the past twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries became more and more open.
Proponents of globalization predicted great benefits for developing economies.
&quot;And these predictions have come true in many ways,&quot; emphasizes Maskin.
So, for example, China and India have experienced significant growth in GDP per capita.
However, not everything is so rosy.
Globalization was expected to close the gap between the “haves” and “have-nots” in poor countries, which manifests itself in high inequality in income, or rather, in wages.
But in reality, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Muskin in his article “Why Global Markets Have Not Reduced Inequality in Emerging Economies,” published in The World Bank Economic Review, which has been translated and quoted by the HSE NIE.
Together with economist and Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, Eric Muskin developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income disparities in poor countries increase as globalization grows, recalls the HSE NIE.
In the new global market, specific processes are taking place.
To demonstrate them, Muskin identifies four skill levels for professionals - A and B for rich countries, C and D for poor countries.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries lack the skill level to cooperate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if workers of level C from poor countries wages increase due to cooperation with employees of B from rich countries, then workers of D do not feel the growth or their wages completely fall.
The net effect is that the internationalization of production will increase the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, accordingly, increase the level of inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin proposed a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It helps explain why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, tenured professor, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions, and head of the Department of Mathematics at the Higher School of Economics.
And like any powerful theory, I&#39;m sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the funds for this, and it is unprofitable for companies to pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations can play a significant role, Maskin said.
The scientist notes that the developed theory in no way calls for stopping the process of globalization, which has borne and is bearing fruit in the form of growth in the countries&#39; GDP.
Derbent: a living connection of times.
Derbent, one of the most ancient cities in Russia, celebrates its 2000th anniversary in September.
The program of festive events includes a festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of past times, an exhibition of Derbent carpets and the Day of Open Temples, a historical and musical show &quot;2000 years in two hours&quot; and excursions to the reconstructed Museum of Peter I.
Medieval stones of the Naryn-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all this seems to have left the pages of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;.
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has survived in its place since ancient times.
Although the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Kaganate and the Golden Horde claimed it.
The age of the eastern plane trees that grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mosque is several centuries old.
These powerful plants are protected by the All-Russian program Trees - Monuments of Wildlife.
The shade of the spreading crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The visitor of the mosque will be poured fragrant tea and treated with Dagestan delicacies - honey figs, persimmons, medlar, miracle cakes, ayran and sweets.
From time immemorial, large samovars have been used in Derbent to give tea to numerous guests at a time.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 AH.
That is, in the year 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
This is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking in its scope and solemnity: the arcades of domes and vaults rest on square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
Keeping and breeding pigeons is a traditional hobby of the inhabitants of Derbent.
Poultry owners put dovecotes in yards, under trees, in attics.
A breathtaking sight - a flock of white doves flying into the sky, similar to the flashes of festive fireworks.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian gates with a double stone wall.
Going 500 meters into the sea, this structure blocked the harbor of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best-preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets in Derbent were woven in the 5th century, and the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged to this day.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets for every taste are sold - rugs made of wool, cotton or felt of all colors and shades, with or without pile, with complex ornaments and fancy edging.
The construction of the city began with magals - quarters with one-story stone buildings.
Over the years, the magals have hardly changed.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioners on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in a medieval, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, details of the aqueduct built by the Persians about a thousand years ago have been preserved.
Ancient springs have survived to this day, in which local residents still collect water.
Many Derbent residents prefer water from proven historical fountains to ordinary tap water.
One of the centers of pottery was located in Derbent.
Watering and painted vases, dishes, jugs, cups were appreciated throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of potters still make wonderful ceramics for both practical and souvenir purposes.
On holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a tightrope, where students of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of this amazing and risky skill goes back several centuries.
A new trend - more and more girls can be seen among tightrope walkers.
In the premises of the former Maiden Bath, the Museum &quot;Culture and Life of Ancient Derbent&quot; works today.
Previously, unmarried girls and brides, accompanied by girlfriends, bathed here, but now anyone can see the vaulted-domed hall, hot and cold pools, bathing accessories that have become a thing of the past.
Most houses in Derbent have hot water, but baths and steam rooms are as popular today as they were in the old days.
The benefits of heating the body with steam are written in old books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, the body gains flexibility and lightness.
The festival &quot;Commonwealth&quot;, which takes place on the territory of the Naryn-Kala fortress, is attended by ethno-courtyards of many regions of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, sing songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and treat visitors to delicious homemade cheese.
Kyrkhlyar is the burial place of forty martyrs who laid down their heads for Islam.
This is one of the most revered complexes for the Muslims of the North Caucasus.
The sarcophagi that have turned yellow from time to time are carved from solid stone blocks and are oriented, as is customary among the Arabs, along the west-east axis.
Brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubov cut and shave clients in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
A hairdresser has been in this place for many years.
Barber craft techniques are passed down from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Yakubov brothers can do not only traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old City, there is a house in which the Decembrist writer Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky lived, exiled to the Caucasus.
Having learned the Turkic language and collected ethnographic material, he described Derbent in the first third of the 19th century with its ancient monuments, life and way of life of the townspeople.
Chaikhana is a traditional Oriental club serving only tea and homemade cakes.
Men come here to quench their thirst, chat with friends and solve some work problems.
As in the past, it is not recommended for women to cross the threshold of the teahouse.
Derbent dance ensemble &quot;Caspian&quot; was created three years ago, but has already managed to take part in events of the republican and Russian level.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, learning to perfection the folk Avar, Dargin, Tat, Armenian dances.
With the onset of evening, when the noise dies down and the street lamps are lit, local residents sit on benches near houses with protruding terraces.
As a rule, Derbent residents discuss everyday issues.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they increasingly recall episodes of the unique history of their city, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
A business &quot;game at the airport&quot; took place in Domodedovo.
A new form of education is being tested in the capital.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport employees.
For this, models of three aviation harbors were mounted at Domodedovo.
Young people not only inspected and checked in passengers, but also served the planes.
All this is in the form of a business game, but in terms of complexity it was not inferior to reality.
Late flights, two passengers with fractures on board at once, the ladder was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For a real airport, hell.
For the one who settled in the hangar of Domodedov - a standard set of tasks to be solved by beginners.
In one hangar, three large airports from different countries of the world fit at once.
Four hundred students from metropolitan colleges and universities work in them today.
An unprecedented chance to learn all about the inner world of an air harbor.
Passenger check-in, aircraft maintenance, baggage turnover - they were even entrusted with buses on the tarmac, ladders and passenger screening.
And the passengers are all problematic.
One of them has a disorder with documents, another missed the flight, the third filled his bag with suspicious objects.
And you need to deal with all this, as in life - in the shortest possible time.
For each of these completed tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual money, as if the airline had paid them the corresponding amounts for flight servicing.
&quot;They are fined for failure to complete the relevant tasks,&quot; explains Dmitry Khilko, financial analyst of the game, in an interview with Vesti-Moscow.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely watching what is happening.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try out a new form of learning.
She has already found a place in the course of secondary vocational education.
&quot;Six interregional centers of competence will be formed, which will, in fact, become new models for the activities of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment,&quot; says the director of the department of state policy in the field of training of workers and additional professional education of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia Natalia Zolotareva.
But students are not up to global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need a day off.
But the marks for this exam were quite material expression.
The newest smart glasses, the best I&#39;ve ever seen!
“I received them for responding in a timely manner to a complaint about our airport on Instagram,” said Sergey Shuvalov, a participant in the game, PR manager of the Frankfurt Airport team.
The best judges, as they say, were taken on a pencil in order to invite them to work by the time they completed their studies.
The US Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret over the closure of the American center operating at the Library of Foreign Literature.
The center has been operating in Moscow for over 22 years.
The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American Center of the US Embassy at the All-Russian State Library. MI Rudomino in Moscow.
&quot;The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation recently cast doubt on the commitment of the Russian government to relations between the Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even during the Cold War and at other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries,&quot; - said in a statement by US Ambassador John Tefft, who entered Interfax.
The American Center has forged deep and lasting ties between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history, and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American eminent personalities, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians, and writers.
&quot;Last year alone, the American Center held over 400 cultural and educational events and received over 50,000 Russian visitors,&quot; the diplomat emphasized.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago, it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX educational exchange program (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was quick to kill.
A typical situation: four officials stand in front of the table of judge Swatanter Kumar, listening to his complaints about the work done.
The court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn’t give you a 110-page order to make fun of, ”says Kumar. -
If even one more brick is laid, we will order all existing buildings to be demolished.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NRT), a judicial branch established in 2010 to stop the rampant pollution that has accompanied economic growth in recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal managed to consider more than 10 thousand claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and the construction of dams.
In two out of three cases, the court decides to stop construction that leads to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: in the less than 60 years since the independence of intensive industrial development, India has turned from a land of pristine jungle into one of the most overpopulated and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is especially acute in large metropolitan areas, where infrastructure development does not keep pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from businesses and households, and the few remaining residential areas are being cut down to build new residential areas.
Despite the formal support of the green movement from the state, NRT is regularly criticized by the government of Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of the largest investment projects.
Thus, in May of this year, the Minister of the Environment called the court decisions &quot;extreme&quot; and &quot;impracticable&quot;.
Sometimes court decisions really cannot be enforced within the timeframe set by the court, confirms environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
However, unrealizable deadlines also have a positive side: at least they make those in charge move.
&quot;His main goal is to shake up this system,&quot; adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly canceled major construction projects: on its account the termination of the construction of an airport, a power plant and hundreds of smaller structures.
At the same time, people are also trying not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagnan state, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We may close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
&quot;People will lose their jobs,&quot; Kumar commented on his decision.
However, such explanations do not always find understanding among ordinary people, whose lives can change thanks to a single stroke of the judge&#39;s pen.
So, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years old from entering the capital, which caused popular outrage.
Despite plummeting popularity and a barrage of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to reverse the decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics on inbound and outbound vehicles from the Delhi government, and also made an offer to purchase 10,000 additional buses, having previously asked the factories if they were able to fulfill such an order.
As pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents began to come to the attention of the court, popular anger began to subside.
But the principal judge&#39;s most sensitive topic was the program to clean up the Ganges River, pompously announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, the sacred river for the Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and starts shouting.
Do you know what the word &quot;saint&quot; means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges onto the statue of God, and there were feces in it, - the judge gets excited. -
You continue to pollute the river because you think: the Ganges is the Ganges, it will take away all our sins.
This is the river that we worship, and look what you do with it every day.
The cleanup of the Ganges is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm by more than 120 times.
Every year from 1.5 to 3 out of 700 million Indians who swim in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money from the sale of his costume, in which he met with Barack Obama, and 455 other items from his personal collection to the Ganges Rescue Fund.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for 700 thousand dollars, while cleaning the river requires at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India still has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that the price of progress should be ecology.
&quot;In a developing country, talking about the environment is often viewed as an unaffordable luxury,&quot; says Call of the Ganges activist Malika Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a middle ground between ecology and development. &quot;

Xi Jinping Calls for an Economy More Open to the World
The economy must become more open to the world to spur growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday to a group tasked with leading reform.
&quot;China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop a policy of openness,&quot; he said addressing the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group Committee on Comprehensive Reform Deepening.
According to him, expanding openness and deepening reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group has adopted a number of directives, including regulating investor access to the market, changing border controls, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to attract private capital, and overhauling the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually debugged through trial programs.
This is an important step as it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, enforcing business legitimacy and increasing openness, according to the statement.
The government will also loosen its control over the powers it has given to companies, thereby ensuring that companies do their own business.
The statement also says that China will allow border regions to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to enhance local growth.
Even more areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of government-controlled sectors of the economy.
&quot;The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of companies with foreign funding, as well as provide them with better conditions,&quot; the statement said.
Additionally, the procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or &quot;green card&quot;, will be facilitated by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed ensuring the rights of lawyers and training for professional judges and prosecutors.
According to an official report released after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended.
