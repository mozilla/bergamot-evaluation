The social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the preservation of the privilege of public transport.
Since September 24, the order of organizing preferential travel of citizens using the social card of a resident of the Ivanov region is changing.
According to the press service of the Russian government on the Ivanov region, the changes provide for the preservation of the privilege of travel in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No. 161 "On the National Payment System."
At the same time, the social card of a resident of the Ivanov region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the terms of its application are changing.
Thus, the limit of replenishment is set now not in trips, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter no more than 400 rubles, in the summer - no more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now the holders of the social card on the receipts issued in transport will need to track not the number of remaining trips, and the balance of money.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens will be 1/2 of the tariff, valid for the carrier.
The remaining half of the fare is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule of replenishment of the social card with money remains the same - between the 24th of the previous month and the 23rd of the current month.
The new order of travel on the social map will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to keep a detailed record of the expenditure of money on the social card with precision to pennies.
In addition, there is the possibility of returning the credited, but unspent cash.
We should also add that the scheme of mutual settlements with carriers becomes transparent, as now half of the cost of travel is paid by the citizen, and exactly the same amount reimburses the carrier budget.
No commission will be charged when money is added to the card.
In his turn, Vasily Silkin, deputy head of the Department of Roads and Transport of the Ivanov region, said that in 2014 the region made more than 33 million trips using a social map, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
The regional budget provides more than 470 million rubles for the provision of preferential travel for citizens using a social card.
As of September 1, the amount of reimbursement for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
Teacher confesses to killing girlfriend during 911 call
During a 911 call, Shannon Lamb, a university lecturer, told police that he shot his girlfriend and that he needed officers to come to their home.
Lamb stressed that there was a "dog" in the house who was alive but probably upset, and said contacts of the victim's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten note on a white sheet of lined paper: "I'm sorry I wish I could bring everything back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," the memo said, according to authorities signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who was conducting two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by then traveled 300 miles to the university campus, where police believe he shot and killed respected history teacher Ethan Schmidt on his doorstep.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Baford said university officials learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made that truthful 911 call shortly after.
By the end of the day, there would be one more victims: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after a shooting at the school forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, officers were still trying to piece together the motives behind Lamb.
The information shared by investigators in both parts of the state, as well as the students and staff who knew him, helped compile a portrait of a talented but perhaps troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gothier, where Prentiss died, said he was not charged with violence or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote in which he expressed gratitude to the "beautiful people" with whom he had intersected in his teaching life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some preconditions for problems to arise.
One student who spoke well of Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the school year 2014-15 how he struggled with stress.
Earlier, Lamb asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to university recruitment rules meant that the doctorate that Lamb worked so hard to obtain would not guarantee him an automatic teaching post.
University President William Laforge said he was not aware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "obviously Mr. Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
Police attacked Lamb's trail after he escaped from campus as he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a 38-caliber handgun in the backyard of his home, one mile south of his parents' home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Metel Johnson said.
His car with the engine was still parked on the driveway.
It was not clear why Lamb came to the house, though Johnson said he believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his Ph.D. in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was an older guy who spent several years trying to teach her how to play the guitar.
In those years it was a success with women.
All the girls were melting when he was around," said Hairston, now 40 and who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time at the time of the events.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage registration.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gothier in a brick house, the back of which overlooks the canal.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and that they have a daughter, now 19.
"She's quite depressed," O'Steen said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Steen said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room's dimly lit bar on the outskirts of Galloway, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were having fun and making fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a retired teacher, led freshman seminars and specialized in Native American and colonial American history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at the University of Kansas at Emporia and was president of the Student Brotherhood and Student Government.
On the campus of The Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university faculty, staff, students and community members, participated in a candlelight vigil.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students back," Laforge said.
The crisis has passed.
Today is the day of recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
The material was redacted in connection with a police statement that Lamb's call came to 911 after Schmidt's murder, and that although Lamb had spoken of Prenticis as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, with the toy and children's retailer saying it will give staff and temporary staff the opportunity to work more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale locations across the country, less than the 45,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it would begin interviewing applicants this month and will increase its headcount from October to December.
Although the holidays are still a few months away, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees in order to have enough staff in stores and on sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about 'dating' princess Diana
"Back to the Future" premiered for Michael J. Trump. Fox's grand event.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the royal family to arrive, and I noticed that the place next to me was free, and then it dawned on me that Princess Diana would be sitting next to me," he said in the trailer for the soon-to-be-released documentary Back in Time.
The film begins, and then it occurs to me that I am literally at arm's length and in one fake yawn from a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time" - a documentary about the film "Back to the Future" - includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Semekis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"For me," Spielberg says, "it's by far the greatest time travel movie that's ever been made."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says in response to Russia's military support for Syria that there is "no military solution" for the nearly five-year conflict, and the increase in armaments will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - during a ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He lamented that disagreements within the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had "made the situation intractable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they showed in resolving the Iran nuclear issue and in considering the Syrian crisis.
8 poll results that show Donald Trump isn't joking
Some tried to label him a provocateur.
Others shrugged it off, taking it as a joke.
And some require a scandal.
But no matter how hard some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's high position in the polls, they haven't (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's advantage in double digits, and some are beginning to seriously question what that means for the real estate mogul in terms of chances to win the nomination.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry was inferior to his pre-popularity Herman Kaine, none of whom won and one state in the process of nomination.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in the general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's "Supercomit of Political Activis" and the economic conservative group The Club for Growth acknowledge Trump's unrelenting power and are beginning to pull out their dollars to overturn him.
Here are some poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just an intermediate phase:
The sympathies ratings for Trump have unfolded 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two in 10 Republicans were positive about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, that was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six in 10 Republicans are positive about Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators prevail in the initial stages.
A poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there are positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of gop voters would suit Trump as the nominee.
In a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "delighted" or "pleased" if Trump were the nominee.
Only two in 10 say they would be "disappointed" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "delighted" against 40 percent of those who say the same about Trump).
Next in terms of delight?
Marco Rubio, who has just 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they will be "not satisfied" or "disappointed" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Trump has been widely criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters across the country think the mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll on Monday.
The same figure appears at the nation's first closed-door caucus in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same person who can be the commander-in-chief, according to quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he's not the kind of person who can be effective in office, and nearly six in 10 independent voters say his temperament is not appropriate for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their connoisseur hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
Asked who was the most likely winner of the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the front-runner, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's no longer the case when four out of 10 bet on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters didn't have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time in the last cycle cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported eventual nominee Mitt Romney.
Still, it shows that many GOP voters see Trump's campaign as convincing.
Even if Republicans had rallied around another candidate, Trump was still ahead of everyone else.
Some connoisseurs point out that such a spread is likely to play a role in Trump's advantage, while not supporting Trump is evenly distributed among the more than a dozen other candidates supporting.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one contest between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets majority support.
He is ahead of Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He's got a draw with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson outspaced the businessman by as many as 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one contest.
Just over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they have changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll conducted Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters who support Trump say they have confidence in their votes.
Obviously a lot can happen and make a difference, and no one can actually say that he will never change his mind.
Forty-six percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
Still, Trump's biggest competition at the moment is with fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their minds are likely to choose Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, the topic of immigration has become the most pressing issue in conversations in 2016.
Some worry that Trump's posturing will turn key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and prevent rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll conducted Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So as long as immigration attracts everyone's attention, it looks like Donald Trump will stay in the same position.
Frustration with the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of about half of Republican voters, mostly because of their outsider status.
A who are among the 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they are more likely to want a political outsider than someone with experience in government.
And they're also offended by Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa conducted two weeks ago shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are disillusioned with The Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "furious."
The government will decide the fate of pension indexation in October.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options to implement the law on indexation of pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation, reports WG.
She noted that a solution should be found by October 8, by the time the draft budget for next year is submitted to the government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the savings pension of Russians.
The hunger striker noted that the amount of pension savings is 350 billion rubles.
About the same is worth indexing pensions in full for the next year.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is no final decision on who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
The hunger striker believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to the socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not quite fair that society pays for it.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are their eyelids often irritated and blush?
Ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashova replies:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
Forgetting about the regular cleaning of the eyelids, we often contribute to the development of blepharite.
The solution is simple:
Do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, carry with you a special wet cloth for the eyelids;
at least 1-2 times a day, clean the edges of the eyelids from the harmful substances accumulated in them per day.
Cleansing procedures are not superfluous to supplement and warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (sage, chamomile), liquefying the thick secret of the sebaceous glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out in circular motions of the pads of the fingers;
wash off make-up, do not use alcohol-containing products.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to even more thickening of the secretion of sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear power engineers have created a nuclear warhead.
North Korean authorities said the country's main nuclear reactor, the Yongben nuclear complex, was operating "at full capacity."
A message about this appeared on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any moment to respond to the "aggression and nuclear threat of the United States" and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "both in quantity and quality".
North Korean authorities conducted their last nuclear weapons test in 2013.
At the same time, plans to resume full operation of the reactor have not been reported since then.
Pyongyang claims to have managed to build a nuclear warhead.
North Korea has also repeatedly tested medium- and short-range missiles, polit.ru writes.
He demanded to remove from the Russian anthem the mention of fraternal peoples.
The leader of the LDPR, Vladimir Jirinovsky, believes that the mention of the union of fraternal nations should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during a meeting of the State Duma, Russian News Service reports.
Who are these nations now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can not stand," - said Jirinovsky.
The MP believes that it is necessary to remove all quadruplets, which contains this line:
In the summer of 2014, he said that the current anthem should be changed to "God Save the Tsar" and the Russian tricolor should be replaced with the imperial flag, polit.ru writes.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the root causes of the problem must be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"That's the crux of the refugee issue," he told RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to reach consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are not possible as long as people are killed, as long as the bloodshed continues and as long as people feel completely safe.
"So we can reach a consensus, but we can't do anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad said.
Recall that about 500,000 migrants arrived in the Eun's country this year, including from Syria.
The European Commission said the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since World War II.
Thousands of fighters from the Islamic State extremist group may be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their own cells in the EU to conduct terrorist activities.
Residents of the German city arranged a holiday for refugees.
Germany has become a leader in welcoming refugees over the past month, although it has recently stepped up border controls to stem the influx.
Authorities estimate that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts say the numbers are much larger.
More than 90,000 refugees have already arrived in the country since the beginning of September.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the town of Darmstadt, where residents give migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn makes his Prime Minister's question session
After Mr Corbyn's election, his prime ministerial debut is expected to be eager
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will soon speak for the first time at the Prime Minister's question-and-answer session, for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will deliver the first of six allotted questions this afternoon; His speech is likely to be closely watched by the press and Labour MPs.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said he might miss some meetings, leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader; it comes after his shadow cabinet appointment and his speech at the annual Trad Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silent during the national anthem at a service on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, drew criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and became the subject of several front-page articles in newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he "stood in respectful silence" and acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But Owen Smith, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in Mr Corbyn's team, voicing divisions over the economy, defence and international politics, while fewer than one-sixth of members of the parliamentary party backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brunt says political divisions are also "accumulating stack" in the Labour party following Mr Corbyn's appointment to the European Union and the government's restriction on compensation payments.
Mr Corbyn told the Trade Union conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at lifting the very idea of restrictions in general.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow Minister for Work and Pensions, said there was "full clarity" within the party that it was in opposition only to the government's plans to cut the ceiling from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr Corbyn will become the fifth Labour leader david Cameron to meet at the courier box in the last decade since becoming leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, said he had "attracted collective resources" to raise ideas for Mr Cameron and had received more than 30,000 proposals.
The MP for Islington North said the Prime Minister's questions were too much confrontation and that he would refrain from wit and sharing barbs, instead pledging to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the shadow economy secretary, would replace him on prime minister's questions when he was absent - such as when Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor as possible, saying that he had reached out to Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow to discuss the issue.
After becoming leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the political style of the "fair balagan" often associated with the Prime Minister's question-and-answer process, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, questions to the Prime Minister have become a key indicator of the leader's views, his ability to govern the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics say it has become a caricature and calls for sweeping reforms.
"Filmed in Joburg" Homeless young people who learned to be photographers
The Johannesburg Business Centre is a difficult place for the homeless.
But one group of former street children found a way to master the craft and earn a living.
"I was filmed in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take photos of neighborhoods and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound sterling rises as UK wages rise
The pound rose on the back of rising wages in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising thanks to the offer to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, uk earnings, minus bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the highest since 2009, and was seen as a postponement of forecasts for possible quotation growth.
The pound sterling rose by more than 1% against the dollar and amounted to $1.5505, and by 0.84% against the euro, amounting to 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SabMiller shares rose 20 per cent on the overall backdrop, thanks to a buy-to-let offer from rival AB InBev.
The deal would bring together two of the world's largest brewing companies, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares rose 0.9 percent amid encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
The latest Richemont sales data exceeded expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - have started to grow again.
Glencore shares rose 5 per cent after the mining giant said it had managed to gain $2.5 billion through a share placement, as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in paper and packaging group Mondi were leading the fall in the index - up 4.3 percent - after Goldman Sachs downgraded the group's rating to "sell."
Shares in JD Sports rose after the sportswear supplier reported an 83 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the half year to 46.6 million pounds.
JD Sports chief says higher salaries could hinder expansion
JD Sports chief executive Peter Cowgill said raising the minimum wage for British workers meant "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in the cost of labor costs, he says.
The costs could have affected plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer additional vacancies.
Metcash launches bottom-up campaign to tackle Aldi onslaught
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
The bottom-up food supplier has launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of Aldi's impending $700 million infusion.
As Aldi prepares to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationship with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and at events such as the Adelaide Show.
The campaign is joined by IGA retailers and suppliers, such as Ice Cream maker Simmo's from Dunsborough, which offers tastings in IGA stores, and shopkeepers selling discounted tickets to South Australian Football League matches.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on September 29, the day the wholesale supplier of food, spirits and household goods will hold its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as in South Australia and Western Australia IGA stores make up almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA chain in the eastern states.
Shoppers in South and Western Australia are known to be adherents of the usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for IGA retailers than in New South Wales, Victoria and NSW - more than 30 per cent in WA and 24 per cent in WA compared to about 14 per cent in the eastern states.
But analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will take 5 per cent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking away all present players, but mostly from independent retailers.
In a report released this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales for the year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA next year and 30 in WA, with sales of $500 million and $600 million in those markets respectively.
Loss in food revenue and sales at Metcash's high fixed-cost levels could cost the company about $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, and this is despite the fact that a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash food sales to fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told attendees at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "could be highly likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Mr Douglass' comments.
But Metcash is understood to have contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, while Metcash's revenue from the food business, which the company supplies to about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 per cent since 2012 due to operating division and pressures on sales and profitability.
However, the company is not giving up, spending more than $150 million annually to equalize retail prices with Prices at Coles and Woolworths for a thousand positions weekly and helping IGA retailers to redevelop the retail fields, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh produce and a wider selection of branded foods.
Metcash CHIEF executive Ian Morris says price equalisation and retail space refurbishment is gaining momentum and hopes the company will achieve a rise in net profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backs Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit, not criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been indirectly affected by the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves more credit for his behaviour than critics, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a junior in the talented duo and often called "Special Ks", unwittingly found himself in the spotlight because of Kyrgios' shameful altercation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, during a torrid qualifying match in Cincinnati, the umpire had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, with Harrison saying: "Wawrinka should have put Kyrgios on his shoulder blades, and I had to put this guy on the shoulder blades."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his racket after a cramp in his leg saved Richard Gasquet from a possible defeat at the US Open, Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinakis.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second behind Bernard Tomic in the singles semi-final of the Davis Cup against Great Britain.
"I'm acutely worried about one thing, namely that Thanasi got involved in the conflict," Healy said.
He did break his racket when he got his leg down at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his racket when hopes crumble, and I know Thanasi well enough to make sure he wouldn't be prouder.
But actually he owned himself very well in pretty provocative situations on the US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he's trustworthy.
He's got a great team, he's got a great family and I just think he's been treated a little bit unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard, fits well into the team, he's never had a problem with other players, he's respected off the court, he's training hard, he's in great shape, he's a very determined and developed young man and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also backed the decision to forgive Kyrgios for an important match starting on Friday, believing "mutual agreement" was the right way out for everyone, but expecting the Canberra lad to return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus on the match, not on the controversy around Kyrgios," Healy said.
And I think Nick has gained momentum very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray are proving, he's growing up in front of the public, he's made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and we need, I think, to get him out of the spotlight for a while. so he can reflect on them and it's best for the team and best for him.
Europe's migration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes border, detains migrants
In declaring a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked its border with Serbia on the southern border and detained those trying to enter the country illegally to stem the flow of migrants.
Riots broke out at the border, with hundreds of migrants flocking to the border area, to which the Serbian authorities reacted strongly.
Stuck indefinitely on a stretch of road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland pitched tents and settled in the area.
However, discontent grew.
As a police helicopter circled over them, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian special police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister has declared it "unacceptable" to expel migrants back from Hungary as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
It is necessary to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border began a day after the 28-country bloc failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that an agreement would be reached next month or the end of the year under which EU member states would accept an additional 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis engulfing the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect swift action from Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's state of emergency in the two southern regions gave authorities more power to deal with the crisis, allowing them to cut off roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Wengia's Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said his country also planned to build a barbed-wire fence on a stretch of the border with Romania to stem the flow of migrants across the country, now that it has completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even the inmates were involved in urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and crossing point for migrants, many of whom are refugees, victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most of the people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees - victims of military action who are entitled to protection, a view that is sharply at odds with those of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for human trafficking defendants.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Soltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters who are at the border have been watching the presence of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bacondi, Orban's national security adviser, said 45 people who had tried to cross the border at the border had been captured by the authorities and 15 others inside the country.
They crossed the border, breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
Authorities are quickly rebuilding the fence.
Hungarian authorities on Tuesday morning also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia, blocking one of the aisles with a railway car wrapped in barbed wire.
Riots broke out on the main border passage near the town of Rjoske, Hungary, as Hungarians placed a service room to pass people inside a metal container and crowds of people pressed each other to break in.
About 20 people managed to get inside, with thousands of people left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway from Serbia to Hungary and announced that they would not eat or water until they were allowed into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the Democratic race for the nomination nationwide, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has support in 47 percent among Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders comes second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he plans to run in the presidential race, receives the support of 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the primary contest, a majority of Democratic voters say it's too early to say they've decided on the candidate they'll support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in their choices than supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has won some bonuses.
Clinton holds a big advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has diminished.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is just five points behind her.
Clinton's preference for Democratic voters under 50 has faded, and he and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton outpaced Sanders by double digits among liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in that group.
Nearly half of Democratic primary voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, current Clinton supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, views are more controversial - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their front-runner, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked openly why they want to see her as the nominee, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), then that it's time for a female president (13 percent) and that she's the best candidate for office (10 percent).
Clinton supporters are also talking about the association linking her to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also called a consensus on issues and chances for election.
As the vice president mulls a potential run, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to join the race - though a third think he shouldn't.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among the party's candidates, Democratic primary voters mostly call Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half said they would have chosen Biden as second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure had fallen from 78 per cent last month.
Biden is in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, when asked what is most important in the candidate, Democratic voters choose other options besides the chances of being elected.
Similarly to last month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have performed well on some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads in honesty, and Clinton's strong side in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have a definite opinion of him on the matter.
Democratic primary voters also generally see clinton, Sanders and Biden's ideological views as similar.
By all of these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters don't have any opinion of Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton's private email account and server during her time as Secretary of State continue, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe it has not affected their general opinion of her.
But that's a different story to the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with her explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion about this was divided back in March, shortly after the story became known.
A majority of Americans say the email controversy has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, though 36 percent say their views about her have worsened.
Mostly it's Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim their views on Clinton have deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: Only 32 percent think she is honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than last month.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider it honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country don't think Trump is honest or trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, get good marks on leadership qualities.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush show the best score for honesty.
Most see Sanders as more of an honest person than not, but as a carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
National poll results Ben Carson close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll
The two candidates won half the vote in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of support under their feet
Republican voters across the country continue to massively support Trump, whose approval ratings have increased from 23 percent in a recent CBS poll conducted ahead of last month's Fox News debate to 27 percent in a poll conducted Tuesday.
But Carson soared over the same period from 6% to 23%.
The poll also showed Carson has support across all demographic groups, ousting Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
Other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, have rolled back along with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, whose support has dropped from 10 percent last month to 2 percent now.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are jointly in third place with 6%.
The margin for error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this newest poll is plus or minus 6%, a poll conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson rising in the polls - showing support among 19% among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
As Support for Carson grows last week, Trump has made several criticisms of the former neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the Iowa caucuses.
Five fraternity members charged in college freshman's death Baruch
About two years after a college student was killed during a fraternity initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
"Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at New York College Baruch brutally attacked Chan "Michael" Deng during a rite of passage in September 2013 and failed to take him to the hospital in time, leading to his death," police said.
Officials say the blindfolded student and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back were pushed several times as he tried to reach the target by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 when Deng passed out and waited for an hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
They did, however, take the time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president, to ask for advice, police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the fraternity members began hiding their personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the fraternity above Michael Deng's health," Chief Wagner said.
He could not be saved and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered several blunt injuries to his head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have suffered as a result of fraternity initiation rituals, as at least one student has been killed each year since 1970," Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing deng's family, said in a statement.
The brotherhood and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
A Monroe County jury was leaning in favor of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with criminal assault and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold accountable not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned all this officially or informally, then her," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the nationwide fraternity excluded the local branch from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be a rise in rates, and the "bull market" will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take before the attack, and how long it will last.
Specifically for the economy, history does not explain much about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for as many as 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's rigidity in raising rates often, though not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
That's why the administration of the U.S. Central Bank so insistently emphasizes that investors should not focus on when it will start to raise rates, but on how much it will take to adapt.
In fact, there are a lot of variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss around raising rates is exaggerated.
"The Federal Reserve's first rate hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the "cheap money" era," Julian Jessop, chief international economics officer at Capital Economics, said in a commentary for clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal, but still low levels will be the seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy might have reacted according to historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, the expectation of a rate hike may lead to volatility for a while.
When raising the rate, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It doesn't look like equity earnings slowed for 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent federal Reserve rate hike study.
Specifically, the market has changed more frequently over the past 35 years - about 14 per cent - towards rate hikes, remaining fairly flat for 250 days thereafter (average growth of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to normal with an average yield of 14.4 per cent over the past six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nu.4 Asset Management. published in Barron's.
Deutsche says the result for equities tends not to immediately become more pronounced during the rate hike, and equity earnings are starting to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often play a part in contributing them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is put in conditions that did not exist before and can accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point in the history of the increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, rates have been raised only twice since 1950, nominal annual GDP has been below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will last, even though it is only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates on such an unstable economic backdrop can be risky and raises the question "whether this time will be different," Deutsche reported.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates by the Federal Reserve all year, with their eyes glued to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a rate hike at this meeting, futures trading is only 25 percent likely.
"In our study, since 1950, all cycles of rate hikes have been in the super cycle of increasing fiscal leverage with GDP overlapping pre-recession peaks very quickly after the recovery began," the report said.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle at the moment is the longest the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, it lasts 74 months and is not over yet.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market expects a rate hike, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one being sold for equities.
The fundamental difference is that the effect for bonds will come faster than for equities when the Federal System changes the strategic rate.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the yield changes the vector immediately after the first rate hike/reduction in the cycle.
At the end of the rate hike cycle, bond yields immediately fall," Deutsche said.
Strategists at Charles Schwab believe that raising rates will lead to long-term and short-term bond yields becoming closer to making the curve flatter.
High-yield bonds often behave better in this climate, although "we still fear yield fluctuations," said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expected results of the federal system policy.
"In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market with the tightening of the federal system policy.
Generally speaking, companies doing their main business in the U.S. will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts will be worse off, as the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market space, and their debt more expensive - in financial.
"History shows that "quality" stocks show performance above market in the three months after the initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer report.
Companies with stable financial conditions outperformed companies with precarious conditions on the results of each rate hike in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital as well as low-volatility stocks also performed better than low quality stocks, averaging 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will be a big issue.
Companies with high floating rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange-traded transactions, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Investors could see profits well through higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM," says Conservative MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the station for 'lowering standards'
Proves that it is becoming less and less distinct from a commercial competitor
Also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying the award was simply ripped off by Brits
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins, who lashed out at The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," the leader of parliament said, prompting the broadcaster to prove that it was doing something that commercial companies were not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that it appeared the public radio station was "stupid" and becoming less different from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems like - I don't like to use the word "simplification" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples that first came to my mind, in which you're really just copying what's already on the market," Mr Bingham said.
The BBC director general has rejected the allegations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don't learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and music creation doesn't really compare to anyone else.
"It's also really important, I think Radio 3's interest in finding new music and promoting new pieces," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey claimed that radio stations have to work much harder to attract an audience than in the past because Britons are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only brainchild of the BBC to be attacked for stepping on its heels during hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice, a talent show the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price tag of 22 million pounds.
Do you see why this program is often discussed due to the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims the BBC 1 show, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in "typical BBC style."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit in its own home stable" the next time it would launch an entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of new seasons of The Voice in the future or the use of money of those who pay the license fee, for other entertainment formats.
The growth of online sales slowed down in August, and Black Friday may be to blame.
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began to be watched in 2000
Online sales intensified three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that November's Black Friday could help contain spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many of Britain's central streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs of a levelling up in online sales, after the latest data showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending on online shopping in August showed the lowest growth since it began to be recorded in 2000, rising by just five per cent.
Experts say there are now signs of a levelling up in online sales, after the latest figures showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates in previous years and go back to 2000, they've always found a reasonable explanation," Andy Mulcahy, editor of imRG's sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so in any conditions, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it goes to the plateau and you can see a decline (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon that came from America is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from shopping on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, buyers five times the average rushed to computers to take advantage of lucrative offers, bringing down a number of sellers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers enter into a real battle for profitable purchases, could make people refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over 1 pound out of every 5 is spent online.
As for goods such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more willingly than in trendy shops on the central streets.
Muslims bury those killed in crane fall in Mecca, and Bin Laden's family sanctioned
Muslims carry bodies of 29 dead through streets as first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the accident on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims who died when a crane collapsed on Mecca's main mosque.
Dressed mostly in white, those attending the funeral flooded the roadway to pay their respects to the first of the dead to make their final journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
A sad procession passed by the sacred place, where just a few days earlier a construction crane broke through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were issued for burial, and at the same time the King of Saudis fined a construction company owned by bin Laden's family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
Bodies of 29 parishioners who died in the collapse of a crane in the Main Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was father-of-four Kasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Main Mosque with his parents before the annual hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said that binladin Group should not have left the crane arrow raised when the crane was not working.
An Arabic version of the decree published by the state-run Saudi Press agency states that Binladin Group bears partial blame for the collapse.
The British edition of the news agency did not give about this details, but reported that the leaders of the company were forbidden to travel outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out the cause of the crane's fall in the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go to the hajj this month.
Binladin Group has not made any statements about the crane collapse and its representatives were unavailable for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and improperly coordinating actions with the weather service.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Main Mosque as part of a major construction effort by the Binladin Group.
Bin Laden's family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and has been running major construction projects.
The late leader of al-qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a traitor son whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in life for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials ordered to pay one million riyals (about 174,000 pounds) to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount irreversibly crippled.
The rest of the victims will receive half of this amount.
The head of the B-Y claims that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for little money
According to Veronica Laurie, Britons are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for specialists
At the same time, Kingfisher is closing 60 stores-warehouses across the country
By Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail Chief Urban Correspondent
They say the British put hammers and paint brushes aside, and instead hire skilled Eastern Europeans to do work in the house
If you know how to handle a hammer or deftly paint walls, it seems that these days you are in the minority.
Because, according to the company-owner of the B-Y, the British are increasingly hiring specialist masters to perform simple housework.
Veronique Laurie, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a network of home furnishing services, said that behind this trend is a significant influx of skilled artists from Eastern Europe offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in craftsman's products, and at the same time close 60 stores in the warehouses of the B.J.
Ms. Laurie said that she would like to see more women in the staff of the stores of the B.J., as eight out of ten decisions about shopping in the store are made by the weaker sex.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to her, the recent demographic trends, characterized by the growing number of households consisting of single women, who are more engaged in housing than in the past, cannot be overlooked.
Ms Laurie said: "Our stores are still predominantly male.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on purchased goods are made by women.
Women play a big role in decision-making.
Ms Laurie - one of five women at the helm of Britain's leading companies whose shares are listed in the FTSE100 index - also changed the composition of the top management team, making directors equal to the number of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with exactly 50 percent of managers - women, including the CEO and CFO.
Ms Laurie said: "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
It was not difficult to find suitable women on the board of directors.
After the group took on the cost of closing the stores, Kingfisher showed a decline in profit and sales volumes for the six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the Screwfix and B's brands, is opening 200 new stores
Time to decide on the interest rate of the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is watching the Meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank, which for two days discusses the crucial decision - whether or not to raise the interest rate for the first time in a decade.
A poll of 80 economists conducted by Reuters found that just over half of those who last week thought the Federal Reserve would do so now believe it will hold even longer and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero and start the process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working efficiently, the economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned the markets to prepare for change, but all said they were confident that every chance against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: Refugees enter the EU via Croatia.
"Open!" chanted hundreds of refugees at the Horgosh checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for migrants.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to probe other options for routes to the EU.
One of them bypasses the closed border with Serbia is through Romania.
The other - through Croatia and Slovenia - to Austria.
According to some reports, buses carrying refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the town of Shidu on the Croatian border.
The drivers were instructed by the authorities to follow non-stop.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovic assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its options are limited:
Our job is to keep Serbia as safe as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, to ensure a humane attitude towards them.
But this is already a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve it, no country in Europe alone can not cope with it, and even more so such a small country as Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is adamant:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia they must fill out the necessary documents.
And if he does not do it, he will not be allowed into our country, because it is quite safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to build the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Meimarakis has been a member of the center-right government for a number of years, leading the country to a financial crisis.
Now he is challenging Tsipras as interim leader of the New Democracy party.
A few days before the election, he met with a Euronews journalist.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat, losing to the SYRISA coalition, but now, according to the polls, New Democracy has equaled it in popularity.
What has changed during this time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr Tsipras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and economic growth prospects.
Now the country again has a budget deficit and a high unemployment rate.
Investors left because Mr Tsipras had driven them away.
Over the past nine months, Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the country's situation in January and Mr Tsipras's false promises.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what really happened.
Daily life was markedly worse than in January, when the situation improved, with the majority of Greek citizens affected.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the elections, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRISA.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The fact is that, as we have learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been in place or are still in operation, political forces and all the ruling parties have come together to implement a programme on which they have reached agreement without giving up their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in support of an agreement between Mr Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you implement the agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted for Greece to move along the European path, because we have a good idea of the disastrous consequences of the country's exit from the EU.
Now Europe helps us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, a Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would have been lost if there had been no treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures are the result of Mr Tsipras negotiating.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government in the first year in power wants to restore order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then, I am sure, all the commitments that cannot be fulfilled because of the recession, can again be the subject of negotiations. but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to believe that, in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect the agreement to be fully implemented.
If we are to regain their trust, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural change that has been agreed upon, continuing to take advantage of EU funding and the great investment opportunities we need to open up to better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations the Tsipras government did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues that we found out when discussing these issues with our European counterparts.
I can give you an example related to farmers' incomes.
We explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that Tsipras's ministers had never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were unprepared and ill-informed, and therefore unsuccessfully negotiated and concluded a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014 we were trying to best implement the 2012 agreement by bypassing the sharp corners.
We have moved forward with reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price of the Greek government.
I was the Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I managed to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that were then a government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, and this is in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations outside.
And we were able to bring the country to a normal situation, which would have continued to improve if the process had not been interrupted by early general elections, which were the result of the December presidential elections.
Euronews: A massive flow of refugees has been moving through Greece in recent weeks.
What do you think about this situation, and about the reaction of the European countries to which these people aspire?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with after winning the election.
And the reason is that the Syriza government did not act in this situation as it should have.
In such matters, you should be ahead of the curve, because if the problem overtakes you, then only emergency measures remain.
And that's what we're in now.
Even the interim government that succeeded Syriza has done more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras has done in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim government, which is provided with valuable assistance by the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will allow to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and mind you - refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
There is a deep humanitarian dimension to this issue, and we will take the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
The appropriate decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, better border controls and refugee reception centres.
We must also make good use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to cope with this pressing problem.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkovka, Donetsk region, during the day, officers of the criminal investigation of the Main Directorate of The Police of the region, together with military counterintelligence, identified and detained a suspect, who turned out to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Krivoy Rog (Dnipropetrovsk region), who the previous evening during the joint drinking of alcohol, and the conflict in the village of Upper-Toretsk Yasinovat district of Donetchin shot his opponent with an assault rifle.

Man who opened fire at Delta State University leaves note of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he "regrets" the first killing and wanted "everything back," authorities said Tuesday.
Police in Gothier, Mississippi, said a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University called 911 around 10 a.m.
Monday and reported that he had shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that police needed to send people to his home.
He said: "Yesterday night I killed my wife" and also mentioned that there was a "dog" in the house who "wouldn't touch anyone" but was probably upset.
Police asked the caller's name, but he did not name him.
Lamb did not explain why he opened fire.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said: "I'm sorry I wish I could bring it all back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
Writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and killed himself Monday night as police surrounded him.
The rector of the university, William Laforge, said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb was suggesting an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, officials on Tuesday reported "no information or evidence" of a "love triangle."
He described him as a "good man" sean O'Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss have a daughter, who is 19, and that she is "inconsolable."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, who the Sun Herald calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home through the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
Police said Lamb called relatives at one point on Monday to say that "he won't go to jail."
That evening, when police overtook him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university's website, Lamb received a Ph.D. in pedagogy from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who lost their luck
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has endured several difficult years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term life partner Farrah Fawcett, who died of cancer.
The actor also reportedly suffered from drug addiction, and was arrested in 2008 for drug possession.
All this, of course, played a role.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw out for several months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about not being able to take the field for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw can play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless tackle in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw burst into the PSV penalty area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture and he is in hospital."
He will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or a day later and then operated on.
It's terrible - the youngster came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and started playing fantastically, and that's where it happened.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and no penalty was awarded.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes the Italian referee made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad roll with two legs.
In a tweet, Shaw wrote: "Thank you all for your messages, words not to describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I'll be back even stronger than I was."
Now Playing: Manchester United suffers misfortune with Luke Shaw in PSV defeat
The England defender will have an extra incentive to get better for next June's European Championships in France.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It's a very serious injury."
When any player is out with a similar injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while playing for Mexico against Holland under Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him now because he had no intention of hurting his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, you feel bad," Koku said.
I didn't have a chance to see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was a ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched it, but I didn't see Luke roll.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to bear it.
It's very hard for me, and I'm sorry.
PSV's Andres Guardado was also taken to hospital after colliding with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorax?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: if your child liked a book, it will be a little time before you will know it almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
Responding to a question from a representative of a company that organizes children's holidays about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "Lorax" - a fairy tale with an environmental bias, written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a commentary published on SuperCamps' website, and continues: "This funny, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children because it always reveals some image or message that we miss."
And all would be well, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to retell the contents of the book, but actually tells the plot of the film of the same name, shot in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original narrative.
"In the high-walled town of All-Southville, where there was no greenery and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dreams, fulfilling her desire - to see a real tree," we read in the text a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Seuss (real name Theodore Sues Geisel), who died in 1991.
If this doesn't look suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads almost like a summary of the plot of the film "Lorax", posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high-walled city of All-Worldville, where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey - the girl of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, admittedly an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about how the environment destroys the greedy tree cut-out and the "all-to-touch" namen, despite the protests of Lorax (whose name is in the book's title) - a funny creature with a moustache who "speaks on behalf of trees."
Most likely, such a simple PR-task was entrusted to the performer, who never read a child a book about Lorax 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been received from Cameron's headquarters, but there was no further comment.
There was clearly a risk for Adam Lyth not to make the England squad, but it's still a tough question
Victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England have selected for this tour, a repeat of the defeat in the Test series with a score of 3-0, which happened last time, does not seem to me likely.
I would also not rule out winning on my field.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are players among the batters who masterfully take the ball and the collective mindset strongly; they will not bring scars from 2012, but only youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali turns into a bowler, serving balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for test level, is an attacking option.
Now Playing: Adam Lyth retired from England Test cricket squad and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to exclude Adam Lyth to me, his head coach at Yorkshire, is, of course, difficult to analyze.
His seven Test matches have had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality is that cricketers are judged by referees on the outcome.
There were no questions about John Root, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've said it before) players are best at choosing themselves.
A couple of half-hundreds, and Lita could have waited a longer career, but he was at the mercy of his own destiny.
We hope that if he scores more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss spoke well of his attitude, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team player first, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take for a Test cricket batsman to leave an impression is a difficult question.
Lyth has played in seven games, as has Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton has played nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on someone else's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lyth was in top form, but this lost opportunity is already in the past.
Alex Hales shows up, and he's a batsman, which I appreciate.
He's an unpredictable cricketer, which we saw at the Yorkshire club earlier this season when he earned 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those who were before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moeen next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would give the opportunity to introduce an extra spinner, saving four speed bowlers, is being pondered, and I don't mind that at all.
I don't see any reason why a batter can't hit the ball there, and this left-hander has already shown that he's a damn good cricketer.
Moeen may not be quite what it takes for his county of Worcestershire, but became the third number for them, and there's not much difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches as a "third batsman" before coming out as an opener in 2001.
He won three hundred at once and did not look back.
He comes to the national team as a back-up spinner, and in my brief communication with him he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his approximate stats - averaging 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a risky bet, but among the spinners voting for a bit, and selecting youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayauordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for Test matches could be a masterful move.
He's one of the best guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience to it, gained under all possible conditions and in any attack.
Collingwood's Paul is included in those games where the white ball is used and will provide both energy and ruthless pace in the set.
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it was playing or coaching, and, like Mahela, he had a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has been said before, can give new strength to the team.
Collinge's Durham team-mate Ben Stokes is left for one-day, Root has been given a similar break due to Australia and I, for one, have no problem with that.
While not everyone will agree, coaches and players do not set a timetable.
And you have to remember how players, their positions depend on results.
Such decisions are never made easily.
Uk's exit camp could win if economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's ill-conceived policy of resuming negotiations to keep Britain in the EU is becoming increasingly difficult every day, even without regard to electing the brilliant Jeremy - "Is it yes or no?" - Corbyn as Labour leader or TUC's outrage over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that with the current EU facing a variety of crises - not all of them of their own making - some member states are fed up with Britain's self-centered agenda of strife-based concessions and undermining the agreement of changes they largely do not want.
Having gathered in Brighton for an annual meeting, the TUC decided that it did not want them in any way if they destroy social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George's selfie program.
The Prime Minister and finance minister ride through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take pictures of themselves against the backdrop of a well-known local monument, in the company of a local celebrity or without it, then come home and say they are attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain to maintain external contacts under the EU's awning - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - suggests that foreign ministers and officials in some capitals come to understand when they don't care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation worsens for her as she has deteriorated for Thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French President Francois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland may soon get a right-wing nationalist government, Spain - the left.
It's hard to see them climbing out of their skin to help "selfie-brits" whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland's exit from the UK - which they also don't want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to issue deliberately unhelpful SNP-style re-films during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to spur the UK's exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The revision was an idea-fix" and "Britain has received nothing of value from the renewed negotiations."
Europeans know at their trouble what a predator Fleet Street can be, and how sceptical media moguls are about the EU, unlike the one that tony Benn launched the referendum in 1975, who backed our 2-1 entry in 1973.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, a hardened Euro-opportunist who became famous for his "straight EU bananas" as a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
For all his stupidity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a motley company of tax-exempt crooks, phone hackers-outsiders and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact Tony Blair had the same opinion about them, but was aware that when you are in a cage with a violent gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Miliband was a greater supporter of Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair went in favour of a repealed EU constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him the winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him for any of this.
But the dear jeremy Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer had time to spend it on me - seems to risk repeating Neil Kinnock's "boycott" strategy from the 1980s - a mistake both then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to engage with the press - not with me, but with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the BBC he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside of Ukip's tradiocianist trend and the wider range of "small England supporters" among the Tories may probably say yes.
It's the same as Hilary-"Benn, but not Benn"-Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his inner Boy Scout struggling to accept that Corbyn's appointment of an obnoxious John McDonnell "shadow" finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father struggled on TV for disloyalty to Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far or losing his Cabinet post.
Hilary's battle was more appealing.
But the struggle to stay "under any circumstances" - Benn's phrase - is not what McDonnell said, and not what J. K. spoke to peers and members of parliament in a private meeting on Monday night, according to the public.
Whatever the Democrat and "his guy" Corbyn wanted to say - remember, he touched even me - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of 24-hour television seven days a week, and especially in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is reasonable not to let Cameron get away from Europe so easily by allowing him to take for granted Labour's support during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's main misconception about EU membership - within the "Bennit" economy of a beleaguered fortress - is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism, generated by minor distinctions, is central to dogmatic debate.
As for his misconceptions about Nato - Tom Watson is unwavering in the fact that J.K. will not agitate for an exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on concessions to Britain when it can all be pointless?
The US is already very disappointed by the weak british military action in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory government in power is cutting spending, as I was reminded on Monday at a lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticise Public Health England's review of e-cigarettes
The government-funded agency said that e-cigarettes were 95 percent less harmful than smoking, with 12 people, some of them linked to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published an important report - a "turning milestone" last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to some experts' links to the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month criticized the "extremely shaky argument" on which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers questioned whether the claims were "solid or shaky grounds."
Martin McKee, lecturer in European Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Lecturer in Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of health - rules should be based on proof of effectiveness."
They said the public expects PHE's statements that "the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking" were based on detailed evidence analysis and modelling.
In fact, this is derived from a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multicriterial decision-making analysis model to summarize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was previously reported to have received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT's health certificates in the Sustainability Report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, without mentioning the funding he had reportedly previously received from tobacco company Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the choice of councillors, but there are several well-known e-cigarette proponents, some of whom have also claimed to have financed the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether the other participants of the meeting have experience of management in tobacco business.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco sector at PHE.
The research paper, published by the group, "elegantly agrees" that there is a lack of "strong evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links and restrictions were affected in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence at this time that e-cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smokers to smoke" are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the BMJ's claims had previously been answered.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All the evidence implies that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what this evidence is proving and what this evidence does not prove, especially where the public has doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
Around 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS 2 billion pounds a year.
Clearly, while e-cigarettes are not safe, they only cause some of the harm caused by smoking, we are doing our job to the nation.
Former Channel 4 chief believes BBC should stop EastEnders series
Former Channel 4 chief executive Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop producing programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would pay a lot for successful shows such as the soap opera Albert Square.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used to create such programs, which are not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public broadcasters, which are likely to be only a small fraction of the audience, at peak airtime, with high-rated shows on rivals and on channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, said the corporation wanted to work more with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully for six years to work with the BBC while working for Channel 4.
"I can't help thinking that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast programmes that could be shown by competing companies that don't receive subsidies," Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of the BBC's future investigation.
If you keep the license fee, which I don't think is a good solution in the medium and long term, the company should leave only those programs that are not produced and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The show The Voice airs in the prime slot, because the creators want to get the maximum possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would show it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to funding gear that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is common knowledge that they are of their own production.
Other channels would certainly give a lot for it.
I don't see how this can be public broadcasting.
I don't think it would diminish the BBC in any way.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "because of staff's ambitions and because of their belief that this is the best way to get support for the long term."
His comments about the BBC's most popular shows echo those of Sky's chief executive Tony Ball, who in his McTaggart Memorial lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested the BBC sell series such as EastEnders.
Johnson noted that more niche BBC public broadcasts "continue to go to BBC4, where you often can't assess the audience, but the company's function is fulfilled, and it can be presented as an argument in sanctimonious sermons justifying the revenue from the licence fees of 4 billion pounds: "Well, yes, of course, we do all these incomprehensible broadcasts that no one watches."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
Referring to the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system as far as who gets the most out of it.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot of money, I wonder, they think so because they don't really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also appeared before the committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should review Rita's mission in favour of "informing, educating and entertaining."
He said that only a small proportion of BBC material was now formally classified as educational - he said it was 1 per cent television content and 0.1 per cent on radio - and that the company should pick up the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "inform, educate and entertain."
On partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as Promenade Concerts (only a fraction of which, he says, is shown on TV), and to join alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for online viewing.
"Sonogenetics" allows you to control brain cells with sound waves
The video shows nematodes changing direction when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are affected by sound pulses too high for the human ear to hear.
Pulses are influenced by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Researchers manage brain activity with light
Scientists said that the worms demonstrate the possibilities of a new technique called "sonogenetics", the essence of which is to use ultrasound to excite certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Srikanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salka Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent into the human brain and used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Nematode worms do not usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
Enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures called "TRP-4 ion channels" found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open up and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of the worms, so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the use of ultrasound to influence modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and injected into the organisms of worms, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in optogenetics, a new direction that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with light pulses.
Chalasani argues that sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the desired area of the brain by fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass unhindered through the body tissues, so for their delivery you do not need to go inside the cranial box.
"We believe that for the treatment of certain neurological diseases in clinical settings, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to make human neurons sensitive to ultrasound signal for a time," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Adverts mock British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's video protesting against the arms exhibition.
Stunning killer drones!
Iron shackles that destroy shin!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light-noise batons, causing unbearable pain, but leaving no trace!
The cheerful voice and hand-drawn animation leave no doubt that this advertisement for the largest international arms exhibition is a scathing parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government's intention to "push" weapons to repressive regimes, taking advantage of the ExCeL centre in Docklands with an exhibition of defence and security systems.

But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and on subway trains, which require to look at them again.
"An important ad going on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them in the fonts of the London Underground with the image of the DLR line turning into a tank silhouette.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will come to the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.
300 posters painted by artists who exhibited their works in the "Museum of Cruel Design" in Banksy Park "Dismaland".
A team called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them across London using a "recruitment of cracker advertising spots," a six-pound set of wrenches that it says "gives access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stops around the planet."
Transport workers in London are not happy with such "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and keen to bring political art to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists begin to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the arms show, welcoming passengers to the subway.
The video from Amnesty has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by the pro bono agency VCCP, with the help of a graphic designer and voiceover artist, also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence around the arms show - with a pass on the ExCel calendar - and thought: "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create more realistic and dodgy corporate advertising, but "filling it at home with bright colors and animation turned out to be more exciting."
"They have incredibly helped us to draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Amnesty's Tom Davies.
We now need the UK government to take action and ensure that this torture equipment will not be illegally sold right at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the theme of the arms exhibition comes from inside ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed the order for the "AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting" from the U.S. Army.
It includes "an unparalleled cumulative warhead that brings unsurpassed armored action inside the target."
Whatever he does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
It's been 11 years since I moved into a student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smiles of those I annoyed - and numerous, long complaints about others.
Basically, what I've learned can be laid out in eight simple rules.
Moving to a hostel can range from slightly nerve-racking to completely intimidating.
He encourages chatter: tell people where you're from, whether you've taken academic leave and where you've spent it, whether you support Corbyn and why you 'honestly, neither love nor hate Marmite' because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract, I'll be at myself."
Take a stand.
And help others to take a break too - ask questions and demonstrate interest.
It keeps you talking and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into drinking establishments, midnight cinemas and common party venues, but they are also the place where people dress up and fix their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting university while in a relationship
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a refuge, but many dormitories form a culture of staggering from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long friendships.
It can be hell for someone who is trying to recuperate.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to keep being friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I can restore the energy I've spent talking to you."
Try to feel when a classmate is tired of communication - and not to knock on it, and send a text message.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
One guy in my dorm followed this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Make friends with baking.
As you begin university life at the height of the popularity of the Bake-Off show, knocking on the door to people to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate biscuits is no longer such a strange action, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we are neighbors, I baked you something, and now smile, and I will ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obligated to talk to you, and in the end, probably, your face will be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you are as a baker.
Poorly blinded lumps of flour, sugar and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Stealing food is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, appropriating someone's chicken is a theft, but is it stealing to get yourself a little milk for tea?
Get the milk owner.
He'll probably ask you not to be shy, even if it's full of rage.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I sympathize with you - but try to treat it more mature than my neighbor, who poured dishwashing liquid into her milk to take revenge on those who took it without demand.
She's in prison now.
You don't have to make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the saying about glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked a neighbor to reduce the sound of a drum and bass guitar, as it was 3 o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally fell silent at 5 a.m., she mercifully allowed him to sleep for two hours, then broke down her music and locked the door behind her, going on a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse settled in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extraordinary, before biting your elbows, clumsily, if you mistook a neighbor for your future spouse, got carried away with it, broke off the relationship, and would have to see him every day, and maybe watch him pull on his side of all your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart can not order - but if the hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool your own fervor a little.
At that exhilarating moment, when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between prank and bullying is thinner than it looks.
A good draw is fun, but turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never pack someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone else's door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not glue other people's things with Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on the iPhone after Apple's update
You can request a new operating system by going to Settings, selecting General, and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to download it and install it.
Some ran into problems after installing it when an error message appeared telling them that "the app update failed."
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the revival subsides or try to update via iTunes.
Hints on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may include removing apps to increase space - but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the upgrade, and has also made it easier to use a special utility that suggests removing apps and re-installing them once the process is complete.
Make sure your phone is charged or next to the charger when you upgrade to prevent the battery from being drained.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the upgrade because the phone's discharge in the process may cause the upgrade to crash.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity with a phone call.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, moscow's military support for President Assad only exacerbates the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about it with his Russian counterpart, PJ Media writes.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Assad poses a risk of escalation and prolongation of the conflict, as well as a negative impact on our common goal - the fight against extremism - if we also do not continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through the direct transfer of power," the US State Department said.
They also noted that Kerry once again emphasized the U.S. commitment to the fight against Islamic State as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member.
In addition, the U.S. "will be pleased with Russia's constructive role in trying to counter the Islamic State."
Last Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what actions Russian troops were taking in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest noted that the time for a phone conversation between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the president decides that a phone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make this call."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime a "losing bet."
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that it was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only make things worse.
"But he did not heed my warnings - and as a result the situation worsened," the US President said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating facilities for recreation and sports from the payment of customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Russian government.
This was reported to Izvestia by Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Lashkina.
In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following a trip to Crimea, instructed a number of agencies - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the FSB, FTS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals for creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - about 200 million annually go to the treasury of European states for maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On amending the list of goods temporarily imported with a full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes" providing a full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating facilities for recreation and sports.
According to the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, - Lashkina said.
The issue was submitted to the subcommittee on customs and tariff, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade of the Government Commission for Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also approved by the agencies as a result of the discussion.
As noted by the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, the proposed measure on full conditional release at importation is inherently a benefit.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the subcommittee meeting in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will make a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member states of the EAEU, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from paying customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to assist foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for use in science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc. - service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), control devices, drilling equipment, stage suits and decorations, etc. relay laboratories and workshops, water skiing, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and religious objects.
The press service of the Russian Ministry of Transport "Izvestia" was told that they have prepared mandatory regulations on the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Theodosia and Eupatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for the registration of the entry and exit of small, sports sailing and pleasure vessels in the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport instructed the captains of the seaports of Crimea to ensure the application of a simplified order of entry of small, sports sailing and pleasure vessels to the seaport and the exit of listed vessels from the seaport.
Also, the Ministry of Transport prepared draft orders of the Russian government on the approval of the borders of the waters of the seaports of Crimea.
In respect of Yalta and Theodosia, the orders have already been adopted, the rest are under negotiation, - the press service of the agency said.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state surveillance, classification and examination, state registration in respect of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult to yachting precisely because of poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, there is a whole constantly developing industry, which involves a large number of people.
In Russia, in fact, everything is in place.
Our coast is of little interest, the only piece where you can operate yachts year-round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that in this area extremely strict rules of the border service: in order to go for a walk on a yacht, you need to issue a lot of permits.
In addition, inside Russia, the yacht even has nowhere to refuel.
Two days it can go with its fuel, and then there is a problem where to take it - says the director of sales of Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
As for the places for storing yachts, in Moscow and St. Petersburg now there are special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. Also yachts are sent for storage in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are rich people, but with the beginning of the crisis the demand for yachts decreased.
The World Bank has allocated a $500 million loan to Ukraine.
The World Bank has approved a new $500 million loan project for Ukraine for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"The new financing will support a number of priority measures to carry out reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," - said in a statement.
The World Bank's Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Tsimao Fan, said that reforms of the banking sector will help revive loans in the real economy and will stimulate economic growth recovery.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank is seeing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Ukrainian government to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved the provision of a loan of 100 million to Ukraine, RIA Novosti reports.
Prisons are being asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
At the Public Council of the Federal Service for the Execution of Punishments (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicts in October 2015, among other issues, they will discuss the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transvestites in the colonies.
Councillor Vladislav Grib told Izvestia about this.
In his opinion, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia, who have not determined the sex, in domestic prisons it is possible to provide separate cells, blocks or even (if there will be many such criminals) in the future to create a special colony for transgender people.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to determine the departure of citizens in such isolated places only after the convicts have passed the appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the perpetrator is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that isolating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice is successfully operating abroad: in the pre-trial detention center (where the accused are before the court's decision) there are separate cells for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special units.
Today, this is the only way out when dealing with such criminals.
They definitely need to be isolated, as the presence of transvestites and transgender people in regular cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSIN employees.
The humiliation of trances by fellow inmates is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big a city is, how many criminals with uncertain sex, you need to calculate where to distribute them.
Some prisons are not needed - only cells, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
As Grib explained, the block can hold 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps will be created in Russia alone, transgender prisoners will be able to serve their sentences from any region.
Citizens are held in pre-trial detention at the place where the crime is committed, so the admission of transvestites or transgender people from other subjects during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes - believes Mushroom.
Recall, the day before, law enforcement officers could not decide in which detention center - male or female - to identify the detainee for drug possession 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), because of which a man with a girl's appearance was not arrested.
He was released home on his own recognizance.
This news was widely discussed on social networks and the media, as the mechanism of keeping transgender people in pre-trial detention centers and colonies in Russia really does not exist yet.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT activist (LGBT- lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places to serve sentences for transgender people, noting that it is also possible to define people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of providing security in prisons for homosexuals, - says Alekseev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made for the sake of this and for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgender people.
At the same time, Alekseev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are ready to impersonate trans-Russians in order to get into a different colony from the usual colony.
Of course, you can introduce a medical examination before putting people in transgender colonies, but it's not always clear.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners Chelsea Menning looked like a man, and already in prison said that he wanted to change gender, - said Alexeyev.
A person can feel like anyone.
But while there are no separate places to serve their sentences for transgender people, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the safety of such people and delve into the intricacies of their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, Boris Lordkipanidze, an international expert on reproductive health in russia, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transgender criminals in the colony could severely delay the start of the sentence of convicts.
A commission is created - it is a question of sexology, psychiatrists carry out long-term observations, it is not one test on the basis of which a high-precision conclusion is made.
Today's psychiatry possibilities allow it.
Therefore, before the change of sex potential patients always undergo such examinations - they show exactly whether the change of sex with surgery is a necessary measure, - says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to convicts, because on average it takes a month for such a survey.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general the idea of creating separate blocks for transgender people supported, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it would be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations - transgender units in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if we take into account that there are about 5% of homosexuals in Russia, we can say that there are even fewer transgender people, and those who have such deviation and also commit crimes, - said Lordkipanidze.
Now, on the application to the administration of the colony, homosexuals, transgender people and so can get separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior World Chess Championship.
The World Junior Chess Championship under 20 has ended in Khanty-Mansiysk.
The end of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and it became the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to catch up with the Pole Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who seemed confidently going to the title.
Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buksa celebrated the victory in the girls.
The World Chess Championship, which took place since the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already by the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all intrigue, as the representative of Poland Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who gave a series of four victories (competitions are held on the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently captured the lead.
Given that Duda was the top-favourite of the championship, and in general is considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he will miss the gap seemed very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the gap to just 0.5 points, he remained the obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov, in order to catch up with the leader, had to win in the 13th round.
But even that wouldn't help, win Duda his party.
Plus, this obligatory victory, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, and then had to wait for his game to be completed by Duda, who met Benjamin Bock.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player drew a draw with the Dutchman.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
Therefore, it was to him the leadership of the Khanta-Mansi Autonomous Region, whose governor Natalia Komarova traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, presented the main prize.
But in the competition of girls intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalia Buxe (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Bux.
The Russian athlete remained second with a 0.5 point behind the champion.
The vimpelcom is changing the regional structure.
The company unites the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - in the East region.
The project will be completed by November 1.
As noted by the CEO of Vimpelcom Mikhail Slobodin, the changes are carried out in order to "remain a strong player in the market" and to develop the company "in new, not always favorable external conditions."
In an interview with Rossiya 24 TV channel, Mr. Slobodin said that they intend to reduce "tens of percent" of staff in Russia.
Rospotrebnadzor checked 78 Moscow Burger King eateries and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volokolam Highway was fined 50,000 rubles, and the establishment on Great Tula Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after all violations were eliminated.
43 diners violated the requirements for the installation of premises.
Among other violations, poor sanitary and sanitary and sanitary facilities, non-compliance with ventilation requirements, in some institutions were found bacteria of the E. coli group.
The burger king franchise is owned by Burger Rus LLC, owner of the Chocolate Chain Alexander Kolobov, and there are 293 eateries in Russia.
Igor Artemyev, the head of the FAS, said that the agency is against indexation by 10% of tariffs on freight and the provision of state subsidies, as requested by the Russian Railways.
First they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and also multi-billion dollar subsidies from the budget, - he says. -
We say: it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own "much stricter" proposals, which are now being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net settlement option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of executing a $300 million stock option, the gold mining company said.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the share issue price in favor of Sumeru and market quotes) that can be taken from free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to implement the option or demand a co-payment.
Details of the negotiations in Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of polymetal project "Kyzyl" in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, director of the Housing Policy Department of the Ministry of Construction, said that the ministry, together with the Central Bank, is developing a procedure for the rehabilitation of developers.
"We understand that there is no getting away from this, so we are developing an appropriate mechanism," the official said.
Drafts of the script of the film "Citizen Kane" will be put up for auction.
Representatives of the auction house Profiles in History announced plans to put up for auction draft versions of the script of the film "Citizen Kane", which is considered one of the best works of director, screenwriter and actor Orson Welles.
The auction will start in the city of Calabasas on September 29, it will present three draft versions of the scenario, the estimated cost of each of them is $20-30 thousand, AP reports.
The first of the drafts, written in 1940 by Herman Mankiewicz, is the earliest script, located in private collections? and entitled "American" - such a working name was in the film.
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, the third - the final plan of the film.
Ministry of Industry and Trade: targeted food aid will not become an analogue of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Viktor Yevtkhov said that the program of targeted food aid will not be analogous to the card system of food distribution that existed in the USSR.
We are talking about modern targeted food aid to the population and support of an effective domestic producer.
I ask you not to speculate on the phrase "food card."
I would like to note especially that we should not confuse the proposed product cards with the echo of the past times of total deficit, card distribution system, in which the number of products received is rationed.
We have so far proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes in the legislation," TASS quotes Mr. Yevtukhov as saying.
Earlier, "Y" wrote that the program on the introduction of food cards for the poor was introduced to the government.

This year, the study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top 1000 Russian Managers" is coming out for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian top-level managers, the study sums up the work of Russian managers for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of last year's winners.
Last year's winners are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate of this year's rating and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, up to ten new managers from other companies are proposed to be nominated to each of the candidates on the original list, which would be appropriate to add to the overall pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following managers of the company's functional areas: CFO, commercial director, marketing director, HR director, CIO, director of public and corporate relations, director of government relations, director of corporate governance.
Each manager proposed by the experts is invited to participate in the rating and given the opportunity to nominate his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
Nominations on the industry principle are based on the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: Information Technology, Commercial Banks, Forestry and Forestry, Mechanical Engineering, Media Business, Metallurgy, Multidisciplinary Holdings, Professional Services, Communications and Telecommunications, Service and Consumer Products, Insurance, Construction, Trade, Transport, Financial Sector, Pharmaceuticals, Chemical Industries, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to enter the site www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see the information about the rest of the participants and can make their grades according to the criteria proposed for each functional direction.
The methodology of the rating is based on the principle of "Best pick the best": top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
Such a principle allows you to get the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of expert commissions.
All candidates of this year's rating and multiple candidates of the rating of previous years are invited to face-to-face meetings of expert commissions.
Commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission to approve the list of top managers and eight commissions on the approval of the heads of functional areas.
At the meetings of expert commissions it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (places are kept strictly according to the Internet assessment and are closed information before the publication of the rating) or to make actualization of their adjustments according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of "Y."
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfortable rate for an investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market for lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January-April this year slipped by 40%.
What do you think is the situation today?
After the panic of late 2014 and the beginning of 2015, the volume of lending to SMEs decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Lending under 25-30% per annum was not profitable for anyone.
If earlier the bank could put in an increased rate all its possible problems in the future, from delays to non-refunds, now it is impossible to do: the rates are already sky-high.
For business, the current level of SME loan rates is uncomfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.
The rate level of 10-13% would allow the business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns on them.
How much do you estimate that the demand of entrepreneurs for loans is met?
After the central bank's interest rate cut, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects of its development and future revenues.
Today, business has one way out: it is necessary to learn how to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
We need to monitor current results more closely, monitor cash flow.
At the same time, if financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment and reduce production and energy costs.
All this ultimately allows the company to make products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the SME lending market that will strengthen and influence its development until the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for the reduction of the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator demonstrates consistency in the issue of lowering the key rate.
However, a radical drop in the price of loans for SMEs is not worth waiting for.
In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes it necessary to increase the interest rate to generate real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even with the reduction of rates of the Central Bank.
If we talk about the level of delinquency, traditionally small and medium-sized companies, limited both in the ability to replenish funds, and in options for correcting economic behavior, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is spelled with Japanese characters.
Beautiful, concise and at the same time quite difficult for those who are used to Cyrillic or Latin.
So the new crossover CX-5, as, indeed, and any other model of the brand: without pretentiousness attractive from the outside, technically perfect inside.
Japanese simply because of its "Japaneseness" is able to bring attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of complete delight.
You can make as many arguments in favor of cars from other countries, and the person even in principle with these arguments will agree, but the whole conversation will crumble from the final phrase: "But it's a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only the technique, but all the other Japanese.
To quote in a hurry Base, season food wasabi, collect katana and dress his girlfriend - no, not in a kimono, of course, but according to the canons of street Japanese fashion: cute, creative and quite unexpected.
Perhaps, Japanese school uniform - the only uniform that girls wear with pleasure after graduation.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the grille with five horizontal lines.
But much more strongly changes the appearance of the car new pattern of headlights and taillights, on which the car is instantly recognized in the flow of cars.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very seductive.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensual, but the appearance at the same time has a touch of rigor.
You don't have to call the police.
Behind the wheel of the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can experience only stoic Japanese calm.
The 2.2-litre diesel engine provides high torque at a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 hp - only 5.9 liters.
Black shoes, black cloak, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with print from the police tape Not Cross.
However, Mazda made every effort to drive the CX-5 you did not find yourself at the scene of your own accident.
To further enhance comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension redesigned the front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the sleeves of the front lower levers.
The all-wheel drive system has been adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and the engine at high speeds is reduced by 13%.
Swimsuit in a flower or stripe is as boring as a budget sedan.
Another thing if the girl flaunts in a swimsuit with the original pattern.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of role-playing action movie.
Then she will get no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both front and rear seats, which provides an optimal reserve of space for both wide shoulders and long legs - who has what.
Still long-legged will surely appreciate the fact that the stops in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not beat on the ankles in turns.
The widest set of Mazda active security systems is offered on the CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used to identify a potential threat.
There are adaptive lighting, and warning of lane departure, monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
Comfortable, with a minimum of ledges, it can hold a cargo of 561 liters.
The costume of the cartoon character in Japan is called "kigurumi."
The pyjamas look especially perky.
You can do anything about it!
Of course I sleep.
But also to entertain young children.
Or just walk around such a little animal on the street ...
After all, it is so cool when there is an opportunity to choose - cool clothes, demeanor or car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the Kawaicat store material.
Kiev tore the atomic union.
Kiev has formalized Ukraine's refusal to cooperate with Russia on the construction of the Khmelnitskaya nuclear power plant.
The Supreme Council on Wednesday on the second attempt still voted to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements on the construction of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but the project could not be started.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine passed a law that terminated the agreement with Russia signed in 2010-2012 on the construction of the third and fourth block at the Khmelnitskaya nuclear power plant.
The bill introduced by the government was only completed with a second vote, the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the required minimum of 226, but then 234 members of parliament voted for the draft.
The Khmelnitskaya nuclear power plant, which was laid down under the USSR, was supposed to have four units of 1 GW with VVER-type reactors, but managed to build only two.
Negotiations with Moscow on the construction led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, in 2011-2012 the Rada passed the relevant laws.
As there were no funds in Ukraine's budget, it was assumed that the blocks would have to be built on a loan from the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to curtail relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing the refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitskaya nuclear power plant and on the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations remained, remained the purchase of fuel in Russia for existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the electricity generation in the country), as so far the Ukrainian NAEK "Energoatom" has nothing to replace Russian supplies.
Plans to build the Khmelnitskaya nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been finalized: back in 2014, Kiev announced negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.
The UN Secretary General is against the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that the situation in Syria cannot be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution," AP quotes him as saying when asked about Russia's military support for Syria.
Ban also said that he will meet with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will hold a meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be on Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolay Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not rule out the possibility of establishing a base of the Air Force in Syria in the future.
So far, there are no such plans.
"But anything can happen," Mr. Bogdanovsky said.
Earlier, "Y" reported that the U.S. does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to the official Damascus is necessary to fight the banned terrorist group Islamic State in Russia.

The OSCE PA reports on a possible meeting of the parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of Ukraine's delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Artur Gerasimov announced the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in southeastern Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, possibly between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," TASS quoted Mr. Gerasimov as saying.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and "returning to normal life of our countries."
Asked whether, in his opinion, a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level - in the "Normandy format" or in the format of a contact group at the OSCE PA site - was possible, Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was held, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, any kind of dialogue is supported in Kiev.
Earlier, Ukraine's representative at the talks, former President Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics have not fundamentally changed their positions at the trilateral talks, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the electoral commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the elections to the city council for the municipal district, distributing 12 deputy mandates, played on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during the elections were voiced by representatives of the Communist Party, who accused the electoral commission of "covering up falsifications".
The opposition's comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the Electoral Commission refused the Communists of Russia party to organize a referendum on the abolition of fees for the renovation of apartment buildings.
The city election commission officially presented the results of the elections to the pride of Nizhny Novgorod for the municipal constituency.
A total of 1.03 million people were included in the lists of voters in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand ballots were issued for voting to precinct commissions, and 268,000 voters voted in the elections.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were declared invalid and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 seats were distributed to political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia" six parliamentary seats in the Gordum are held by Dmitry Swatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorno-Karabakh.
The only mandate of the LDPR was given to the party's leader, Vladimir Jirinovsky.
Two mandates of the Communist Party are divided between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
Three mandates of "Just Russia" go to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now within five days these candidates must decide whether they will work as deputies in the City Duma: in case of refusal of the mandate, he moves on to the next candidate on the party list.
Chairman of the city election committee Alexander Makeev told the members of the commission that he was introducing duty on "sending telegrams to Jirinovsky and others" for the renunciation of mandates.
When approving the protocol on the election results, the representatives of the Communist Party of Russia reported numerous violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the city election committee with the right to consultative vote from the Communist Party of Russia, suggested that the results of the vote in the four districts No.21-24 should not be recognized, recalling that the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located, was closed on the orders of the head of the administration of the Sormov district.
Neither the deputies of the State Duma, nor the candidates, nor observers could pass inside for a long time, and the resonant scandal with the storming of the doors of the district administration was shown on TV.
All observers and members of the commissions with the right to consultative voice had the opportunity to attend the meetings of the district commissions.
The head stopped accessing them only when the voting had ended and the precinct commissions had not yet arrived to cast their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
"Then the chapter was corrected, and interested persons could be present at all meetings," said Natalia Andryushina, a member of the city election committee.
The Communists objected that the deputy of the regional assembly, Lyudmila Aristov, was illegally detained in the blockaded administration building for more than four hours, and a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition also resented that in a number of ICCs on the day of the elections began to seal the ballot boxes at 6-7 a.m., putting out in them ballots for early voting.
At the same time, the members of the commissions with the right to consultative vote and observers were not notified, so they came by the beginning of the elections at 8 a.m.
The Communists are sure that in the morning hours before the opening of polling stations in the ballot boxes could uncontrollably throw ballots.
However, the city election committee, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander Makeev, did not find any violations with the infiltration of unaccounted ballots.
The members of the commission and the proposal of their colleague from "Just Russia" Maria Popova to come up with amendments of the regional legislation to clearly establish the time of opening of envelopes with early voting ballots, which then fall into the ballot box, did not support the proposal of their colleague from "Just Russia".
"As a matter of initiative, contact at least the CEC," Alexander Makeev advised Mrs. Popova.
At the end of the meeting, the chairman was attacked with loud accusations by a member of the Communist Party of Russia, Sergey Samokhin, who shouted that the electoral commission ignored dozens of complaints and covered election fraud.
"You are not here at the rally, be careful declare!" - the chairman of the election committee was offended.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
The electoral commission has until September 27 to approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the Nizhny Novgorod City Council of the sixth convocation will be scheduled within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city election commission refused to register the initiative group for the local referendum.
Judging by the documents, the party members were going to bring to the discussion of Nizhny Novgorod residents two questions: whether they agree that the fees for the overhaul of apartment buildings should be "immediately abolished" and tariffs on housing and utilities "freeze until 2020."
However, Irina Maslova, a lawyer for the Duma, explained that the appeal of the "Communists of Russia" is against the law.
FedEx revenue mixed, with 2016 forecasts falling
FedEx reported disappointing results in the last quarter, and the delivery service giant cut its full-year profit forecast due to falling demand for freight services and rising costs in its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx said it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in preliminary trading 45 minutes before the exchange opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84 according to factSet.20.
The decline comes despite an average 4.9 per cent rise in rates, which will come into force on 4 January, and an increase in land-based heavy or heavy or bulk cargo charges, which begins in November.
The company said it still expects revenue growth from last year, thanks to cost cuts, higher gross revenue and increased online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "has worked steadily given the weak economic conditions compared to forecast, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
Plans to hire the workforce over the holidays were announced a day after a competitor, UPS, announced that they planned to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same as they were hired last year.
FedEx earned $692 million in the quarter ended August 31, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $2.42, close to a forecast of $2.44 per share, conducted by the zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by the zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a downturn in the fixed-term international transportation sector, which has led to a lack of gross revenue growth in its express transportation division.
However, the boom in online shopping has dramatically improved the fedEx Ground results.
In the last quarter, revenue from ground transportation increased by 29%, but operating income remained unchanged due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express transportation division received higher incomes due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector income fell due to higher labor costs.
In preliminary trading about an hour before the stock opened, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At the most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve leaders will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table of Honduran mahogany, deciding whether it's time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of the ornate meeting room, two floors above them, a wall image of the United States will hang over them.
This card is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the country's economic interests above all others.
The central bank received a double order from Congress: to maximize employment in the U.S. and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, federal leaders have acknowledged that there is a third, unwritten order: financial stability.
And this third order may prove to be an unknown factor in the nearly predicted decision, announced Thursday, on whether the U.S. economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by near-zero short-term interest rates since late 2008.
Even though most of the data show solid growth in the economy, recent turmoil in global financial markets may deter already cautious Federal executives from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds - even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus Co.
"However, I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Federal Reserve will do, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
Roughly half of economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast an interest rate rise this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to keep from doing so, with the key indicator showing only a roughly 30 percent chance of a rapid recovery.
This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal System raises the rate, provided that decision-makers do not soften the blow with the promise that the next increase will not be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to 16,599.85.
The rise was triggered by expectations that the federal policy makers would abandon the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It would be a surprise if the Federal System raises rates at this point in time," he said.
If the Federal Reserve leadership does so, "they will have to go far in approving their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so they don't panic."
Other experts countered that a rate hike could calm financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about how the federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal Reserve appeared to be leaning to raise rates by 0.25 percent this month, making the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expects a rate hike this year, despite complaints from the Liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs slowed in August, labor market growth has been stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years, and nearly the same level that the federal system considers full-time employment.
Wage growth shows signs of accelerating.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank's target annual rate of 2%, the federal system's management said the key reason was the temporary effect of the sharp drop in oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the shrinking labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16 percent from a record high in May as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy could hamper global growth.
The market partially regained ground this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below the May high.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve, market outrage further complicates the difficult calculations of the term of the interest rate increase.
"In the absence of information about what has happened in financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have started to tighten the screws at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve official.
Now, he predicts, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy might be, and they have almost no reliable data after the recent events in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal System and should not technically be taken into account when making these decisions.
But essentially the Federal Reserve has become a global financial authority.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
A single hint from then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could "mute" its monetary expansion caused market turmoil around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, it would be expected that Federal Reserve leaders would not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more of an art than a science," said Mr. Karabell, chief executive of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve, there have been instances of overreaction to financial market movements that do not seem to be related to economic principles."
Lacker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who has insisted on a rate hike, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The Asian financial crisis has led to the Federal System lowering its base rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite the limited identifiable effects on U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the heads of the federal system reversed those cuts.
The Federal Reserve should put stability first only in times of great crises, such as the market crash in 2008," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate-setting committee.
The latest panic did not come close to that level, he said.
"You certainly wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're afraid of a rate hike because markets are in turmoil," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for Global Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and doesn't mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get ahead of the curve.

State Duma Speaker Sergey Naryshkin admits that the U.S. is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East, so that waves of refugees poured into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulan Bator during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question begs itself: is not Europe the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East with such manic persistence in recent years?" he asked.
"Surely someone assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who are fleeing death, will rush to the prosperous countries of the EU," he added.
Naryshkin asked: "Have many political leaders in Europe spoken frankly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally flooding their countries?"
"No, old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent," he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO flouts many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially looked at how the military boots, sewn according to NATO standards, trample on both moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law," the speaker stressed.
Government forces and paramilitary forces loyal to them are opposed by rebels, consisting mainly of Islamists.
Later, the Islamic State terrorist group, which is banned in Russia, joined the Syrian government's opponents.
The U.S. supports rebels who oppose both Assad and IS.
Official Damascus considers such rebels terrorists.
The Syrian president cited the reason for the West's dislike of Russia.
The West's claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are actually sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, Channel One, Rossiya 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put in his place another, who will act in the interests of Western countries, and not in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to the sharp reversal of the Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in an undemocratic way, despite the fact that he was elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West."
Putin called on the international community to join forces with Assad to fight against Islamic State.
Commenting on the constant statements of the West that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves - then at the request of the people, and not by the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communique.
"If the people want him to stay, the president stays, otherwise he should leave immediately," he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded that cooperation is being carried out with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism in conjunction with neighbouring Iraq.
Speaking about Iran's military support, the Syrian leader noted that the country supports the Syrian state in politics, economy and military sphere.
He denied claims that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran supplies us with military equipment.
"Naturally, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out," he explained.
As for the rest of the States, we are open to cooperating with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
"We don't see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Isil coalition led by the United States," Assad said.
The death toll exceeded 230,000, while the number of refugees exceeded 11.5 million.
The Islamic State terrorist group, which is banned in Russia, has seized part of the territory.
The U.S.-led international coalition is carrying out airstrikes against IS positions.

Lavrov and Kerry discuss situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the State Department John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
Kirby did not provide further details, however.
At the same time, he said that the U.S. has the tools to "further isolate Russia" if it supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov during the conversation with Kerry again stressed the need to create a united front against the terrorist groups operating in the territory of the country.
They also discussed ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Earlier, U.S. officials said Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about Moscow's increased support for Assad.

Beard called the information of the American newspaper slander on Strelkov.
Former head of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic Alexander Boroday denied the information, which was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with Lenta.ru.
The washington post's note is beautiful in that it's completely misrepresented.
Former Minister of Defense of the DNR Igor Strelkov, of course, no one connected and "exited" him from the territory of the republics of Donbass in a very high spirits, without ropes, without three trucks of money, which are attributed to him by different characters," he said.
According to Borodai, the talk about Strelkov in conversation with a reporter of the American newspaper really was going on.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," the former head of the DNR government said.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that Strelkov was taken to Russia "bound".
I suspect it's a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, then it is surprisingly misunderstood words, as I stressed that Strelkov left himself," Boroday said.
"This is a slander against me and Strelkov," he concluded.
Earlier, an article appeared on the pages of The Washington Post, which quoted Beard's words that he had forcibly taken Strelkov to Russia.
According to the newspaper, Borodai noted that he was forced to tie up his associate.
Polish authorities began to search for a train with nazi gold.
Polish loggers began cutting down trees over the underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reported.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary in order to verify the veracity of rumors about railway composition with treasures.
Inside the train may be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, tomasz Smolarz, the governor of Poland's Nizhny Sea region, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence of the existence of the gold train was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to cordon off the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland's Deputy Minister of Culture, Piotr Jukhovsky, said that local treasure hunters with a "99 percent probability" had found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich, which is mentioned in the legends.
He noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, and the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm appealed to the authorities of the Polish city of Walbzhih with a report that they found the train in a walled tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to people under 21 years old.
Russia's chief narcologist has proposed banning the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Eugene Brun noted that up to this age "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - acts especially harmful."
So he said on the live radio station "Speaking Moscow", commenting on the information that the Speaker of the Council Valentina Matviyenko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years.
Man matures unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, the person is physically ready for it.
Mentally, he is ready for a full life in society since the age of 21.
"It is known from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, finally matures only by the age of 21," Brune said.
Earlier, Sultan Khamzaev, a member of the Public Chamber and head of the "Trump Russia" project, told Izvestia that Matviyenko supported the initiative to raise the age limit for the sale of alcohol and "agreed with the Public Chamber to raise this issue again on the platform of the upper house of parliament."
According to the activist, a working group will soon be set up in the Federation Council to draft a bill led by Matviyenko.
Bible asked to check for compliance with children's information protection law
A resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor's office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law "Protecting children from information that harms their health and development," the correspondent sib.fm read a statement on September 16.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased the Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society in the "Chitay-City" store on Red Avenue.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his opinion, violate the FH "On the protection of children from information that harms their health and development."
On September 16, the application was accepted by the prosecutor's office of Novosibirsk.
The answer to the appeal of the resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is far from banning the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - the complainant commented to the correspondent Sib.fm.
In addition, it is quite a fundamental problem that will stir up society.
It will begin to reread the Bible, which it has not done before.
Brazilian Union of Pediatricians Rio Grande promotes healthy eating for breastfeeding
Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a scandalous method by which it is going to convince women of the need for a full diet during breastfeeding: the method involves showing images of infants sucking breasts, painted with images of harmful food.
Breast milk contains a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to high energy needs, pregnant and female birthing women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that a single calorie increase is not the only diet change that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy eating of pregnant women actually affects gene expression in children and prevents their tumors from developing.
Unfortunately, the negative effects of unhealthy nutrition on the child's immune system have been revealed.
A train rammed a school bus near Hamburg.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on a railway track.
The 23-year-old female driver, who realised she could not derail, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute after that, they had a collision.
He was videotaped by one of the schoolchildren.
Because of the emergency, there was panic among the students.
Some children began to cry and run along the roadside.
The route is still blocked.
Police said no one was injured, except for one passenger on the train who suffered minor injuries.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300,000 euros.
Doctors call for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for boxing to be banned in the country following the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a duel with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with the victory of Magali by knockout in the 12th round.
Brown was taken to hospital with a head injury.
His condition was assessed as critical and he was connected to a life support machine.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one fight ended in a draw.
He is survived by two children.
This is the second fatality among Australian boxers in the last six months.
Braydon Smith, a 23-year-old student, died of injuries sustained in the ring in March.
Now the AMA recommends not to engage in this sport, and it is better, from her point of view, to ban it altogether.
I understand that this is unintentional," said the organization's vice president, Stephen Parnis. -
But in the form in which boxing now exists, there will always be situations when the athlete receives a hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads to either death or severe damage.
For this reason, the AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body that brings together medical practitioners and students.
Sergey Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
Russian State Duma Speaker Sergey Naryshkin called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians unacceptable.
He said this while speaking at the OSCE PA session in Ulan Bator.
We see this as unacceptable, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and ignoring the principles of open international dialogue," the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on OSCE PA members to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get morality back into politics.
Let us bring dialogue and the law back into international communication.
Let us return the humanist ideals to the democratic world order.
"The two-way has never ended in anything good," he said.
Speaking from the podium of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on members of the assembly to focus on the next specific security objectives.
"First of all, on resolving the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group," Naryshkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be commended.
"This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician stressed.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulan Bator and will last until September 18.
I got a good time winning for a couple of days.
World Athletics Champion Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for 24-year-old track and field athlete from Barnaul Sergey Shumenkova.
He managed to win the European Team Championship at his 110 meters crown distance, set several records, and most importantly - to become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the Diamond League, finishing third in the overall standings.
"New Izvestia" asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the outgoing season.
Sergey, is the season not over for you yet?
Yes, I am going to perform at the World War Games, which will be held in October in Korea, and then I will think about rest.
However, now I will prepare at home, in Barnaul, and to be at home - it is still a completely different state.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is the favorite time of year for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a great time.
Passions after the main start of the season boiled off, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.
You can compete in pleasure, on "relax."
Plus you know that the vacation is very soon...
Is there fatigue?
After all, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions ...
Fatigue by the end of the season always accumulates.
And it does not matter what he did more - won or lost.
Every competition is stressful.
Constant flights, moving - all this does not pass for the body without a trace.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now my emotions are on the rise, of course.
I'm just happy!
By the time you finish at the World Championships in Beijing, come back often?
Happens.
And you journalists don't let me forget about it.
But in general, I think that bad is the athlete who lives with old victories, scrolls through his successful races again and again.
I got a couple of days to win and we have to move on.
Did the preparation for this wonderful season be very different from usual?
I can't say there was anything so special.
We started to prepare in December, but I missed the winter competitive season.
I trained first at home in Barnaul, then at training camp, then at home again.
It's business as usual.
But the coach set a task: to try to reach a new level, which I have not been to.
Almost all winter time was spent to lay the base.
We ran a bunch of crosses, did exercises on general physical training, which included both cravings, squats, and back we pumped.
Then we started to take barrier training, a lot of techniques were done.
Have you been watching the way the opponents are performing?
I always try to do it, the good in the age of the Internet with this there is no problem.
I watched the Winter European Championship, and there in the barrier sprint the whole pedestal was occupied by the French!
I thought: we need to do something, dilute this company.
With each start this season you added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've had all the last seasons stack up in roughly the same way.
There's no such thing as running at 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always unwind my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was focused primarily on this result.
But the paradox is that you kind of feel that you are ready for feats, and at competitions to show their readiness is not always possible.
What was it like at the London Olympics?
To be honest, I tried to forget that semi-final race (Shubenkov could not qualify for the final. - "NI").
Ready was very good, really could run out of 13 seconds.
Even if he repeated his best result at that time, he would have become a bronze medalist of the Games.
But no luck.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
How about that?
In Daegu it was.
I really wanted to get into the final, there was such a program-maximum.
And fell off right in the morning, in the preliminary races.
That's when I realized that tearing and rushing headlong is not to run anywhere at all.
Two years later at the World Championships in Moscow already reached the final with the best time.
I remember my feelings well before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the gold!
How do you manage to develop a decent speed, not to lose your head, not to disconnect?
And that's the hardest part.
You need to be very careful, focused on technique, so as not to break down the barriers.
I noticed that when you tune in not to the result, but to the process, so much easier.
And the most high, when you have the feeling that you run and everything seems to work!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the hinterland after the first major successes seek to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever had such thoughts?
It's better at home anyway.
I don't know where I'm without my coach, who needs me?
It might be nice to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
Have you been together with Klevtsov for a long time?
Since I was 12 years old, since he came to athletics.
Or rather, first I trained with his wife, who worked with children, and then she passed me on.
I started with a sprint, then jumped in length, triple.
Children's all-around was - it's when throw the ball, jump in length from the place ...
At 14 I tried running with barriers and I liked it.
From the first race it was possible to meet the standard of the second adult category.
And so it remained.
Fear of barriers has never been?
Once it was possible to agree with them.
But the technique always had to work very much.
There's a lot of torment over one crackdown!
But there is no getting away from this routine.
The technique should be honed constantly - so that at night I could be woken up, I immediately got up and would run through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing claims that it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually revise my races, but I couldn't resist.
But we need to work on efficiency further - there is no limit to perfection.
Aren't you afraid now that the victory a year before the Olympic Games will fall on your shoulders with a heavy burden?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
If you chose this road, then must go to the end.
My coach likes to say that if you're not a wimp, you shouldn't feel any extra weight.
And I absolutely agree with him on that.
Otar Kushanashvillei
Well, I am not so naive that I was surprised by the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, do not feed them bread - give, throw the enemy.
And although I didn't wrap the flag, and the same thing, exactly the same, a million times said here, and directly called no one a bastard - I was hurt.
All my pseudo-friends in a moment, in a second somewhere evaporated.
The pressure I'm under is so strong that even I, who saw the kinds of lads, think that people are full of white.
It was like walking, walking, and you were attacked by a mob and mutated with bars.
But you have to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'll hit a howitzer, I'm old, guys, afraid.
It's another thing - no support.
I had no illusions, and now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so take a bite.
And only jerks can give passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson.
I wish I had a job, a better journalist, a shameful job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili sharply described the Crimean events:
What was done with the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I believe that the reference to how the drunken Khrushchev tried to sign something, in any case does not fit into the overall picture of the human dormitory.
It's like coming to a neighbor and taking his living space...
The war from the Kremlin has gone, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100% sure that, as in the summer of 2008, it started with a call from some bastard from the Kremlin's prison.
I have any idea who it might have been...
Kobzon doesn't have much to live for.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he going to lose his apartment?
Well, they demolished his monument.
Of course, people remember him as insulting his small homeland.
And reconciliation now only depends on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seven leads the rankings despite Ninth To highlight leaders' loss on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's outing to Canberra to highlight the impact of the Liberal Party's announcement of the leadership's nomination failed to lift the ratings.
The Morning Show Of The Ninth aired from the state capital after Malcolm Turnbull's defeat of Tony Abbott.
Competitor - Sunrise - with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armitage, stuck in London as part of a week-long international broadcast series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture didn't seem to matter much to Australian TV viewers, with Sunrise's audience of 397,000 viewers in the five biggest cities compared to Today's audience of 339,000.
Today scored slightly more than its rating on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000, compared with 330,000 for Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers, up from 314,000 for Today.
That's the most interesting thing that's been going on all morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for clarifying!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
Important news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thomson.
A new drama about a recently widowed father of a family who decides to move to New york on the coast with his two children, has gathered an impressive audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics speculated whether Thomson could handle the popular show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result is a loud answer to yes.
Seven's X Factor remained strong with an audience of 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For Seven, luck and failure were mixed on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (from 5 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.) of the new TV quiz, which was hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, attracted 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 5.30pm to 6pm) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat's Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of Chase Australia attracted 520,000 spectators, and the second half hour - overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat has raised 620,000.
The drop in Chase Australia's ratings for the second evening will force Ninth to quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is the replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire.

The three finalists are unanimous that "The Bachelor" Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Is the secret revealed? ...
Lana Jevon-Fellowes, Sarah McKay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally made it clear which of them will win the Bachelorette.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually remain in "The Bachelor" is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who reached the final, of course, remain silent about which of them got his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jevons-Fellowes on the eve of the day when two of the three girls would have to be left, they may have inadvertently given a clue about the winner.
Sam Wood remains quiet until Thursday's final
All three women come in a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, purposefulness, family values, cheerfulness as reasons why each of them would be happy to become his companion.
However, with their answers to the question "If not you, who should get the last rose of Wood?" they could unwittingly tell, which of them actually won the heart of "The Bachelor".
Jevons-Fellowes and Markoski made no mistake calling McKay the perfect pair for Wood.
Sarah and Sam have had a good relationship since day one.
"From the moment I joined, I felt (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy and knew they were very good for each other, and throughout the show I didn't doubt it," Jevons-Fellowes said.
"Sarah is a very open person, easy and fun with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, there really is an attraction between them.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will make a great pair.
McKay herself said that thanks to last week's home dates, she realized that Wood may be "the same person."
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realised it wasn't just a game - I believed him with all my heart," she says.
When asked who to choose Voodoo, if it would not be her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snezana and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor is out on Wednesdays at 7.30pm on Channel Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several career options in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle became very interested in him after his move to the U.S. - as well as a host of other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like it was a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian rugby league player allowed on the first return of the punt in the 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another opportunity to bring back the punt, and also tapped him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed himself on a good side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of scattering the newcomers in front of the team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly backed Hayne at a post-match press conference.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received support from special teams coordinator Thomas McGay, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne lost the ball on the Minnesota Vikings' return goal during the first quarter
Hayne and his many Australian fans clearly didn't count on such a start to his NHL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing as he left the field after losing the ball, and he later told the host of the show "Hamish and Andy" on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a more unsuccessful start to an NFL career.
"It happens, you just think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his blunder to his Origin series debut in 2007, when a throw of the ball in his own zone brought a try to NSW.
In the end, this experience proved to be very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne was photographed with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted the picture on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of weapons at a Siberian airport.
Khodorkovsky was openly challenged by President Vladimir Putin, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his attempts at democracy were thwarted.
Migrants clashed with police at the Hungarian border.
Refugees staged protests on the Serbian border near the Hungarian town of Reske, which escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, Reuters reports.
Migrants throw stones at police and try to tear down a fence at the border.
Reinforcements have been sent to the scene of the clashes, and the police are taking measures in response to aggressive actions by migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through a police cordon, after which dozens of migrants ran into Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border by bus towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, the BBC reported.
The country's authorities allowed the migrants to enter the Croatian territory and to ensure that they were transported from there to the desired country.
According to Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, Hungary's parliament tightened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, as well as an expedited procedure for processing asylum requests.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, so he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary for one year.
Also, the Hungarian parliament in the near future intends to consider the transfer of the functions of border protection to the Hungarian armed forces by the parliament of the country.
In late June, Hungarian authorities began building a 175-kilometre barbed-wire fence on the border with Serbia to stem the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian confessed to committing the largest cyberattack in the history of the United States.
Vladimir Drinkman, accused of stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers in the largest U.S. cyberattack in U.S. history, admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, Reuters reported.
During the trial in federal court in New Jersey, Drinkman admitted conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke about collusion with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen, who are accused of cyberattacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"Defendants like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy and national security," said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman faces 30 years in prison, as well as a fine of $1 million.
In sentencing, the court will take into account the Confessions of a Russian and possibly reduce his sentence.
Drinkman's sentencing will be announced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smiljanets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt in the alleged crimes.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk of Russia-backed Bashar al-Assad's regime.
During a phone call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad exacerbates the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power," the U.S. State Department said in a statement posted on its website.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the fight against the Islamic State group (which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) as part of a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad "will never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Also during the phone call, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can be resolved only through a political transition from Assad.
The White House threatened Russia with isolation because of its support for the Assad regime.
The day before, White House press secretary Joshua Earnest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Earnest offered to join the international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against Islamic State.
Recently, the media often report on the presence of Russian troops in Syria.
To which Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping Syrians to master the equipment to use it against Islamists.
Four killed when police fire rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police began firing rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the country's proposed new constitution, a spokesman said on Wednesday.
The violence took place Tuesday evening in Rupandeh district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country's capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of the district police, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reported that police used tear gas, then fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in southern, plain nepal, where Madezi said the new provinces, formed under the new constitution, would reduce their political influence.
Protests have also taken place in western Nepal, among The Tara citizens who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since 10
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted for articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create a company with 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as a center of the chemical industry, has a developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago Sayansk was headed by a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
He told the regional correspondent about the results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects.
Oleg Valeryevich, how did you start working as mayor?
First of all, I familiarized myself with the results of audits of financial and economic activity, initiated an independent audit of the expenditure of local budget funds.
The municipal property was then audited.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the paperwork to five days.
Previously, papers could be used for months.
Measures have been developed to increase the income base and optimize costs.
Last November, a visiting meeting of the government was held in Sayansk, where the issues of socio-economic development of the territory were discussed.
There was no project-estimated documentation (PSD) for any site in the city.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of the PSD on roads, kindergarten, northern sewer and water main.
Roadworks at two sites are already underway.
How is the Russian President's decree on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such positive demographics in the city have not been observed for the last 27 years.
So the issue of provision of places in kindergartens today is one of the most pressing.
Since September 1, kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 places, has been closed for major repairs.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, after the renovation, kindergarten number 23 opened, which is now attended by 200 children.
Repairs were made on the terms of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost amounted to more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment were found, and the People's Initiatives program also helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children between the ages of one and a half to three years.
We don't have queues for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors showing interest in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be carried out, first of all, Sayan enterprises, they need to be provided with work.
In October, a 60-unit house for orphans in the Leningrad district is commissioned.
As for the construction, I would like to add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya, which was included in the program for the construction of economy-class housing.
All the necessary documentation has been prepared.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin soon.
In total, we announced the construction of 10 thousand sq m of housing Wanting to participate in the program very much.
One of the conditions - housing should be no more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this cost includes turnkey finish.
If we can handle the set volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Territory was built Sayan pig complex, which in 2004 was sold for nothing.
We are working with the prosecutor's office to appeal this deal.
Moreover, the land under the object - in federal ownership.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to the regional property is being resolved, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor who is ready to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the launch of the pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great help for the city.
Is the Institute of Social Partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have about 140 agreements of socio-economic partnership.
Many projects were implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
The companies such as Vostok-Center, Novo-Siminskaya CHP, Sayansky Broiler LLC, PK MDF LLC provide tangible support, and the management of these enterprises responds to all appeals.
Directly to the Day of the City "Sayansky Broiler" LLC gave the city a children's town, the company "East-Center" carried out repairs of the equestrian yard, where specialists deal with children and therapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to the sponsorship funds it was possible to improve the territory of the city registry registry.
Sponsors helped to colorfully celebrate the Day of the City.
As in the good old days there was a parade with the participation of city groups and organizations.
A chronicle of the city, a book of Sayan poets was published.
The first builders and people who have made a serious contribution to the development of Sayansk have been presented with jubilee medals.
Patrons also participate in the work of the city's charitable foundation.
The very first step was to acquire instruments for young talented musicians.
For nine months, more than 800,000 rubles is directed to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from low-income families.
How are personnel problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
The city lacks doctors and subject teachers.
In order to solve the personnel issue, the provision of specialists with housing is of paramount importance.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, four teachers received official housing.
We have a housing program with the possibility to privatize it in five years.
The plan is to redevelop the building, which will build eight more apartments for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the "Housing for the Russian Family" program.
In the future - the construction of a house for public sector workers.
The most important thing is that the city has a working team with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a bill on indexation of social pensions taking into account the increase in prices.
The State Duma introduced a bill providing for indexation of social pensions annually from February 1, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document - MP from "Just Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsev - also proposes to carry out additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the rate of growth of the living wage exceeds the rate of growth of prices for goods and services.
The indexation of social pensions, according to the current legislation, is carried out annually from April 1, taking into account the rate of growth of the pensioner's subsistence minimum in Russia for the past year.
The draft law, introduced in the lower house, provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions taking into account the rate of increase in consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexation is postponed to February 1, and the second one is held on April 1.
The head of the OSCE PA told Mogherini that sanctions against parliamentarians should not be imposed.
In an official letter to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, OSCE PA Speaker Ilkka Kanerva said that sanctions against lawmakers participating in the assembly's events are unacceptable.
Nikolai Kovalev, a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulan Bator, told reporters.
According to TASS, signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus and Greece, were collected in support of Canerva's position.
"There is already quite a lot of support," Kovalev said.
Earlier, he stated that the head of the OSCE PA was going with the intention to collect signatures of deputies, which indicated that it is unacceptable to impose sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise the issue to the level of the EU's governing bodies and "send the relevant petition."
NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of Cape Verda Islands is 60 percent
A wide front of a low pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of cape Verdsa Islands has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure area roughly in the middle between cape Island and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, forecasters in Miami said.
Google launches campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced the start of a campaign to double donations, designed to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google took an uncharacteristic personal approach by announcing a fundraising campaign on its blog.
Instead of being made by one of the executives, Google employee Rita Masood, who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We got on dubious trains and buses, starved, thirsty, cold and feared," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, many people like my family are desperate for help.
Donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double the first $5.5 million in donations until the amount on the google.com/refugeerelief page reached $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, sparked by much of Syria's four-year civil war, which has seen more than 4 million people flee this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with low obesity may be helped by obesity surgery
The beneficial effect after obesity surgery in people with low obesity in type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say that low-obesity diabetics live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality statistics are not immediately available," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgery expert who wrote about the new study in the JAMA Surgery editor's column.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of organizations to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal at a rate of 18.5 to 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass surgery and sleeve gastrectomy, with medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in obese people.
The average BMI for those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year of study.
At the same time, the BMI for those receiving non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains at about 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and partly - 28%.
In the group receiving medication, for comparison, only 1% of diabetes was fully cured, and only about 2% in partial diabetes.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "generally had better rates in the surgical group," the authors said.
The researchers also monitored levels of haemoglobin A1s in the blood, which reflected blood sugar levels in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better to hold below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But the best glycemic control rates, reflected in good A1c haemoglobin levels, have not reduced the mortality rate in five years, according to study leader Dr Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared to the group, The bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in BMI (by 7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1s (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and was closer to complete diabetes remission (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment does lead to longer life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the College of Medicine in Phoenix, Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who chose bariatric intervention, the probability of dying within 15 years was about 29% lower than the group that used more traditional methods.
While the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encourages people with a BMI below 35 interested in such a procedure.
"The report here is very important because it argues that this surgery is safe in a low BMI group with no increased risk of death or kidney disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once a patient's BMI falls in the range between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse this.
In Mytishchi, the robbers took out of the house fur coats and 9 million rubles.
In Mytishchi, robbers attacked the residents of the Moscow house and stole from them 9 million rubles and three women's fur coats.
This is informed by Interfax with reference to the press service of the Russian Interior Ministry.
The incident happened on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown people through an open front door entered the house located on Gorky Street, tied up the 20-year-old son of the owner of the house and, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million rubles and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case under the article "Robbery" was opened.
Fans from Europe risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to watch the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to get the appropriate permission.
According to experts, this is a very worrying sign.
In the run-up to the world championship, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to resettle all the guests of the city.
"Rosbalt" interlocutors believe that because of the tournament the cost of renting rented apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship for rented housing will have to overpay.
The World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for the championship, each hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo the classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the stated number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of inspections that they often do not even send documents to the requests of the Federal Antitrust Service in St. Petersburg.
According to the head of UFAS Vadim Vladimirov, the department has studied 138 hotels and now plans to start 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to antitrust officials.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived citizens by placing a certain number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now on account of literally every number, none can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship fans will occupy all St. Petersburg hotels.
Now in the city tourists can count on 30,500 rooms.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 - two- and three-star, 550 - one-star.
According to the first deputy committee for the development of tourism Nana Gvichia, so far only 23 hotels have passed the classification - so many inspections were carried out by accredited companies in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel ordered a similar procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny by a surprising coincidence is unknown.
That is, there may be more who have passed the classification, but no one knows about it.
"For the last six months, hotels have not been very keen to get classified," said Ekaterina Shadskaya, director of the Northwest branch of the Russian Union of Tourism Industry.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason - budgets, which were not laid the cost of inspections, and the procedure can cost the hotel depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles or more.
But recently hotel managers have stepped up and started applying for classification, Shadskaya assured.
Hotels have to have time before July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but also will not get the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that depending on the stardom, a fixed fee for a hotel room for the duration of the tournament will be developed.
The formulas for which the cost will be calculated will be made public next year.
This is done in order to prevent the price rise by 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to have a conscience and prevent a raise two or three times, but hotels need to be allowed to earn.
"I think the growth will be up to 50%," explained Gennady Lamshin, president of the Russian Hotel Association.
For his part, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixing corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I do not know how much this fits within the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better than an unbridled rise in price," he said.
It is unclear what will happen to popular cheap hostels.
State Duma deputies have introduced a bill according to which hostels should be banned in residential buildings.
We hope that this law will not be adopted or will not concern St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved," Nana Gwachia said.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels in any case should be ready for the tightening of the Housing Code.
If the State Duma does approve the bill, about 80% of hostels will close in St. Petersburg, and at the moment there are 1.5 thousand rooms.
According to Leonid Garbar, president of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers of the North-West, There are not enough two- and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg, which are in demand by football fans, but there is a skew towards hotels with four and five stars.
This state of affairs is similar to the situation when "75,000 VIPs sit in the 80,000-seat stadium".
This can be corrected just at the expense of mini-hotels.
The expert considers their possible ban "idiotism": "It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason the newcomers cannot."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that it is wrong.
But if as a hotel, which guests come for a short period of time, why not?
Mini-hotels risk missing the World Cup because of their sluggishness.
Entire hundreds of small hotels simply do not have time to pass the classification, and the pit dig themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be ordering works.
"Companies that can carry out this procedure are not so many, so they will refuse less paid orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those that are more expensive," - Gennady Lamshin said, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the rates of passed inspections at the moment are much higher than In St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is also related to the constant reshuffle in the tourist block of the government, which does not contribute to coordinated work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, that will most likely have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
Following the example of celebrating the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, the city can mobilize the river fleet, that is, guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will arrive prepared in vans, in which it will be possible to spend the night.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels, so that then they are empty," - Gennady Lamshin is sure.
Also very popular during the football championship will be used rented accommodation.
Most likely, the city will create a reserve of rented apartments.
Rental rates will increase by 10-30%.
"Obviously, the first to leave the housing near the stadium," said Larissa Bragina, a rental specialist at the Real Estate Development and Research Agency.
Moreover, the price of rent may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
The construction of new transport interchanges on the outskirts of the city will also contribute to this, she stressed.
We should not forget about the human qualities of citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city, where people not only prompt the way, but can also conduct a mini-tour.
There are also complications.
My father met a family from Murmansk in the yard in 1970 - a father, a mother and two children.
They had nowhere to sleep: it was difficult with hotels, it was hard to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," the interlocutor recalled.
However, he added that now there is no such trait in the residents of the city - to call to his home is fraught with consequences and scary.
But maybe in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, mistakes of hoteliers and governments will have to remember the former?
Jirinovsky "drained" the Amur region.
Today I looked with admiration at the clowning of Jirinovsky in the State Duma.
He did such things when our generation was still learning how to sell newspapers, and is still in great shape.
The theme of the speech seems to be "the LDPR protest against the results of the elections in the Amur region."
The protocols do not shake - for there is nothing; The LDPR does not seem to have any other protocols other than those signed by the election committees.
Here he picks up the runner-up Ivan Abramov and shouts something like: "Here is the winner of the election!"
And then he pounces on Rodnina, and then, after a skirmish with the presiding officer, he takes the faction out of the courtroom, yelling literally "You are all with the fronts of your crooks and thieves".
The press, of course, gives an emphasis not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insults.
In reality, Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region together with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another antics of Jirinovsky in the style of "Scum!", and not a protest of the political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction formally scandalized, and the elections, according to the party's website and Facebook Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader of the topic obviously gets off.
Provides the dead on Cupid to bury their dead, and he evans against "United Russia" as a whole and innocent Rodnina.
An elegant solution to make sure that both the face does not lose, and in the present, and not ostentatious scandal do not go.
Another thing is that now In a strange position is Abramov himself.
Apart from the screams from his superiors, he did not wait for anything, there are no protocols of alternative on his hands.
He - not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for a narrow circle it became a formal occasion and for insulting the respected champion, and, even cooler, boorish attacks against the EP and onf.
And then, of course, he needs to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, the policy number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 for the only regional single-member district, he can turn into a pariah, which successfully used its own party leadership and super-irritant for the very ONF and the party leadership of another.
That's for sure - there would be no Jirinovsky, it should be invented and respectfully watching him.
Trump has yet to grow and grow before him.
There was a news that the LDPR would return to the hall during the next plenary.
That is, the bath fell from nothing at all.
The only thing is that Abramov's subject was buried under her.
Beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists has called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama's Centre for Ethics Studies in Oxford at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He said that in the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be superior to those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised germany and Austria for their actions in response to the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"Caring for thousands of refugees is fine, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries," he said.
At the end of the day, we need to think about how to reduce the number of homicides in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush's actions in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the U.S. harsh response triggered a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that a solution to this problem is possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it had unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have swallowed hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers in the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed a high-alcohol hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, cases of hand sanitization fluids reported to toxicology centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children come into contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately a certain percentage of them go to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink disinfectant specifically, and some do so to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
Videos on Youtube show teenagers drinking disinfectant as cheap booze.
The teens reportedly mixed disinfectant fluid with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the pleasant smells of disinfectant fluid.
"The child doesn't think it could hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (disinfectant hand fluids) are those that are flavored.
There are hand sanitizers with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectant contains anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's high-concentration alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief medical officer at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn't just leave a glass of whiskey, but people keep these hand sanitizers in plain sight, and if the kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently swallowed a strawberry-flavoured hand sanitizer at school, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
She had a blood alcohol level of 179, twice as much as an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija confused her words and could not walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors observed her through the night at a separate children's clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain injury as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchie said.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Gigiea's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectant wipes, in addition to removing hand sanitizer fluids from their children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, not ethanol, which was listed as a valid substance.
In January, three fourth-graders in northern New York conspired to poison their "nasty" teacher by "spreading antibacterial substances in the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher is allergic to hand sanitizers and has forbidden to keep them in her class.
Police believe the failed plan was an "empty conversation" and addresses discipline issues to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children's library I.N.K. Krupskaya is sad cast-iron owl.
Toddlers who come for books, trying to feed her candy.
He has been going to this library for several generations for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twenties of the last century staged high-profile readings here, staged performances on Mayakovsky's poems, conducted literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalin" wrote in 1939, every day "the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovskaya Krupskaya and friends of the children's library of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent her children's photo to distant Barnaul friends.
And when the Barnauls asked if Nadezhda Konstantinovna objected to the library being given her name, she wrote that she did not, she did not mind.
Letters have long been dusted in the museum, and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose harsh profile adorns the bas-relief on the library building.
In the years of perestroika often called different people, indignant: why the children's library is not renamed?
Let there be a library named after some good children's writer, without political coloring!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby - a walkway of yellow brick.
"The Wizard of Emerald City" is a favorite theme of the artist Oli Moskowka.
Previously, Olga was a manager in a law firm, came to work at eight, went to five, and from all the other managers differed only love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet: "An illustrator is required for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mother has cancer."
Olga was making illustrations, and I thought: life can end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it, if you do not create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books of writers all over the world and composes fairy tales herself.
Traditionally, it is believed that children lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space ...
But children are going to us, and their parents understand the importance of reading, - the director of the library Tatiana Kushvid tells "Russian Planet".
In recent years, we even had such a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and it will live - the kids are coming here!
I think interest in reading is coming back.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition stained glass window with updated photo exposure.
Once a block, new photos of readers who go to the library as a family are posted: mom, dad and children.
The library rejoices that fathers are increasingly coming with children.
If at the age of two the child read only Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs more complicated books.
But now there is a law under which an eight-year-old prodigy is forbidden to issue books from the category 12.
To get such a book, the child must bring his parents - they come, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes for them something like a family club.
In the library there are treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of yats and ers, the story of Korolenko in the annex to the magazine "Niva", the "Murzilki" for 1936.
After all, we are now not only a conceptual space "temple of the book", we are now open to the movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school - explains Tatiana Kushvid.
We can come to read, play, draw together.
We have made a play area for kids - the child comes just to play, and the hand is still drawn to the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they rest their feet, do not want to leave.
Often come moms with strollers - and we are pleased that the library they put in the first place among all the other places where you need to come with kids.
Tatiana Kushvid says that modern children love classical children's literature just like we once did:
"Publishing is now evolving, and much attention is being paid to authors who are the link between generations."
And if we talk about little children, it is important for them that there was some hero who travels from one book to another.
Children do not like to part with their heroes.
The library constantly produces booklets for parents, in which it tells what is happening in modern children's literature, what books are worth paying attention to and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is still not for them.
It is forbidden for adults to take books outside the reading room.
Only children have this magical privilege.
... In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement, in the bookstore.
The steps will creak under your steps - it's a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood you meet as an old comrade: hello, it's good that you and I do not change.
Ellie still cheerfully walks along the road, paved with yellow brick, lazy Tolya Ryzhikov steals magic matches, and Boychish-Kibalchish never told the cursed bourgeois of the Military Mystery - such a firm word.
Books like passwords, they can be learned from yours anywhere.
There are real book rarities in the vault - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of animals and ers.
Or The Story of Korolenko in the famous annex to the magazine "Niva."
Or the 1936 Murzilki undershits.
Time has aged the pages, painted them in tea color.
These editions are no longer given to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I dream all - I will retire and take care of rare children's books.
But the children will not be told about it: the paints in the old books are not very bright, and the themes... you open the first page, and there -- Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now it seems: why did we all write this "Pioneer Truth?"
But it was still interesting, - says "Russian Planet" Galina Ilyasova, head of the book store.
The pages of "Murzilki" have darkened from time to time.
Galina Vasilyevna has been in charge of the bookshop all her life.
She knows what color the cap in Buratino, in what school year Harry Potter became the captain of the team Gryffindor at the championship in quidditch, in what situations Carlson uses a silencer for the motor, and who works Alice Selezneva's father.
For the work of a librarian pay little, and all who can live without these book ranks, very quickly find a different profession.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, teachers, ministers of the cult of the book.
They can be recognized also by a smile - it is considered that this is a professional feature of the children's librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation - it's a professional.
In general, I love children's books: as a librarian I like them to be, to stand smoothly and beautifully on the shelves, and I also love to read them - says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think in my childhood everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that was happening to me then.
And since I loved them madly, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sits and reads.
I hope that the books will always be, despite the readers.
And I rejoice when our former readers bring children, and even grandchildren...
Rumour mill: There is no disagreement at Celtic
Griffiths denied talk of a disagreement at Celtic after Deila's admission that Hoops were in a bad position, but he will fix it.
Hearts will protest against the Scottish Football Association's claim to Neilson, while Warburton fears signing contracts in January that could upset the team's unity
Dons increase advantage over Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a slight advantage over Hamilton at Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to break away from Celtic by five points.
Griffiths denied talk of disagreement
This sparked rumours of controversy at Celtic, which were thwarted by Griffiths, who said he and his team-mates were not suffering from any increased criticism as they prepared to meet the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don't think we feel the tension, I think the players are aiming for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in the fight for the title - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team member Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because he does not compete for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now a representative of Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show the most attractive moments of Celtic's games, but why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what interests them.
There's a lot of tension in Old Firm games and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'm going to change everything," Deila said.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic are going through difficulties, but the Norwegian coach has vowed to change everything.
The defeat by Malmo and, as a result, the champions league exit was soon followed by a loss to 10 Aberdeen players, who are now five points behind, top of the table.
However, Deila said: "Selica has had bad periods before and we will come out again."
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand that this is very annoying and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic's support because it makes the players much better.
Staying together now is so important.
Warburton awaits January transfers with incredulity
Despite the views that emerged just a couple of weeks ago suggesting he had identified some of the January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is incredulous about the January campaign, claiming he does not want to destroy the team's unity.
The former Brentford striker said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a pre-season period for them to adapt, which you've seen in our own group this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Michu, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at the end of his career
Swansea striker Michu, who was linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted he could leave football after his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has suffered from ankle problems for two years and has been unable to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts set to confront SFA over Neilson allegations
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and lost 3-2, but the defender's red card was later cancelled; this is Collum's third red card, revoked in eight months.
Neilson did not retract his words, claiming, "I did not question ethics, I did not comment on the game."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
A stubborn Hibernian player has been reprimanded after admitting singing a song with offensive words about former Hearts player Rudy Scacell.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was heated," the striker said, adding: "I can safely say I wasn't going to go back to Tynecastle if he didn't play for Celtic.
Donnelly: Tannadice board confident in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly says that the board of directors of Dundee United is still confident that the management team will change things for the better, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation on the pitch should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We're going to get the guys out again," Donnelly said.
McInnes is glad that "ugly" beat Hamilton
Derek McInness admitted his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assies to secure a seventh successive league title victory, putting them five points above Celtic at the top of the standings thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInness said: "There is no team here that wins anything - a cup, or a league championship, who hasn't won a game like that."
The unemployment rate among Scots is not changing, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of non-working people in the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the UK's 5.5 per cent, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with the number of people currently employed at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter - above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scottish Affairs Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy."
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months we have seen a further improvement in the Scottish labour market with employment growth and a reduction in unemployment.
Why I'm a witness to an Oklahoma execution
Today, by evading legal intervention at a late stage, I will watch a person be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting on the lookout for a death row in an Oklahoma prison when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The first request was made back in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As this day approached, I became afraid.
So why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the detailed story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique angle.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more willing than places, the results of the grim lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we're having our own relationship after months of phone calls and one visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration says I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I'm going to have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of being impartial.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have articulated better" herself, but still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants a journalist from an international publication to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I've recorded.
I'm not going to go into detail here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not to blame.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treeze make him guilty of aiding the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death penalty was not enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm going to watch him die.
I can't say I'm going to be completely objective.
There will be other reporters to turn to for this.
You'll learn from me what it's like to watch a person I like die unnecessarily.
A man being chased by police was persuaded to climb out of the Canning River
Constable from the town of Canning Vale managed to persuade the man to get out of the Canning River, and to stay dry.
A Perth resident intended to get away from police but failed to get stuck in the muddy water in shallow water a few metres from a police officer trying to "gently persuade him to come ashore."
Canning Weil police were called on Tuesday after illegally entering a foreign property in Buckingham.
When police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them by rushing to Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He was standing in the water and saying, "I'm not going to go out, let's grab me,"" Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledyne said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavetz did not want to wet the uniform, so he used a safer technique - "negotiations with a good policeman."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," Senior Sergeant Castledyne said.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins is exactly what I remember.
In 2006, Cousins drove into a ditch to avoid a meeting with a police patrol for a liquor test, and tried to swim across Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but prompted the locals to invent a comic "biathlon Of Ben Cousins."
Peter Moody accuses stewards of attempted espionage and threatens to retire from equestrian sport
Peter Moody has accused Racing Victoria stewards of trying to introduce a spy into his stables last year and threatened to leave equestrian sport immediately.
He was targeted by stewards and ethics officers from Racing Victoria, whom he accused of campaigning personally against him, and the removal of Lady Tatai from the launch due to a breach of drug rules on launch day on Wednesday was the latest straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media he was always working hard to race and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of Lidari's cobalt test, which he could not explain.
He kept his tongue out about suspicions of espionage for a year and a half and didn't want it to "look like green grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been patient for a long time, but sometimes it's so out of your way that you can't hold back," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to go through the consequences, and I'm going to have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep soundly.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start thinking it's not, then I'm going to have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally stated during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat down in a room with a man I would name if asked and offered him a job at my stable to pass on information about what I was doing in my stable," Moody said at the Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a crook.
If so, they should all, of course, apply, because the attempt to catch me has failed.
Robert Rolston, the former chairman of RVL, David Moody, the current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, the current chief executive of RVL, knew about it all the time and know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's becoming personal?
Shouldn't RVL have the courage to hold you accountable for what's going on in this business, people other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I so bad for this profession?
Maybe people out there think it is.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now might make them think about it.
But I've gotten to the point where I don't care, and it saddens me.
It makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and give them responsibility for making a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The trainer's annoyance only grew during the long investigation into the cobalt and Lidari case, and the horse's recent withdrawal from the start led him to declare that he could "throw his licence on the table."
Moody, best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the demands for the use of medication on the day of the competition "ridiculous" after the horse's legs were pressed from clay, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules at the races.
"I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly gave her a compress on her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on race day.
Moody could be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of drugs on the day of the competition for the use of a compress, which stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but it's gone too far," Moody said.
Driver who ran over and fled the scene in Cobram has been arrested
Police have arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobram over the weekend and fled the scene.
A motorcyclist has been taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old Kobram resident, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy fends off rivals' accusations of tough power
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described his team's criticism of the interception of the ball as an "imposition of the agenda" from the two NRL championship favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the umpires allowed the Storm to "fight" his team during Storm's surprise victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear reference to the Storm after his team won the qualifier final against the NSW Cowboys on Saturday night, when he described the game as "typical" for rugby league and said two of the NSW teams were not "too successful" in the hand-to-hand scrum.
Bellamy defended his team's interception of the ball and said they were simply focused on "contact" by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was encouraged by his team's criticism of the two leading coaches, as it meant they were concerned about a possible defeat by storm.
"It keeps popping up - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talking about tough looks when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can vouch that we haven't changed anything for a year in our systems or defensive techniques, just in the last six weeks we've paid special attention to contact when intercepting the ball, and that was a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and he's obviously coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing and it's been a shock for him.
Funny how it always manifests itself at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football," reminding his teacher that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010, showing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his saturday night game to ours on Friday night and see how impressive their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized a lot, calling it a boring team, and Wayne said that he did not care.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
It's football that you want to play when you have players like that.
He made that remark in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat concerned about playing with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think of us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm and Roosters game was a more points-scoring contest than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game it was 20:18, there were two more tries - and what, this is impressive football?
Or consider impressive breaks and failed attempts?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some stage we can meet them there.
Storm have a weekend at the end of this week, as they have won the right to host either the North NSW Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night for the preliminary final at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb accused of drug possession released on $200,000 bail
A man facing life in prison for attempting to embezzle 40kg of cocaine smuggled into NSW has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on a Solay yacht sailing from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Throughout the morning Maksimovich and his accomplices were seen on the wharf, and later he met them at the Cafe Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kg of the drug in the Toyota Echo.
Despite the fact that Maksimovich faces a life sentence for trying to misappropriate drugs in quantities sufficient for sale, Maksimovich's lawyer claims that there is no evidence that the latter tried to get hold of the whole party, and that the man could have been in the cafe without any intent.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maksimovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia a lot," he told the court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovich's mother and stepfather were asked to pay a joint bail of $200,000 for his release.
"It is clear from both of the testimonies that the $200,000 bail is too much of a financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But this measure alone is not enough to guarantee that it will not disappear, the judge added.
Maksimovich was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passport, report to the police daily and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsikaris: "Proud of the Greek team, which fought until the last seconds."
The head coach of the Greek national team Fotis Katsikaris paid tribute to his team after the eurobasket 2015 quarter-final match with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was decided by individual mistakes.
It was a big game," KATsikaris was quoted as saying by AFP.
We were preparing for a great game performed by the Spaniards.
We tried to work in defense, but mistakes in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I will be entrusted with the functions of Kaun at CSKA."
CSKA rookie Joel Freeland said he does not believe in the curse of the army.
The Briton also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke with coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team," Freeland was quoted as saying by R-Sport. - In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in defensive structures and in attack from the three-second zone, and I think I can handle it.
Yes, I'm going to need some time to adjust to the center position, after all, I played more forwards in the NBA.
Now we will have to face more big center opponents, but I have done it before, so I think I will cope now.
The Army last won the Euroleague in 2008.
Since then, they have reached the Final Four six times, but they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
There is an opinion that someone jinxed the team.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it is difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, then we have a good chance to win the Euroleague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the evil eye, I'm not a superstitious person and I don't believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then anything is possible.
I don't have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "For me, the match against Roma will be special."
Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique did not hide that he returned to Rome for the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group stage with Roma with special feelings.
According to the coach, the face-to-face duel of his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique coached the Wolves in the 2011/12 season, but failed to prove himself with the best side in the Italian capital.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I gained some experience. - quotes the official website of UEFA words Luis Enrique. -
I have extremely fond memories with Rome.
It's going to be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with a victory.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I expect Roma to play in Serie A against Juventus.
This is a strong team that knows how to press and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: "Krasnodar has different options for attacking actions."
Acting head coach of "Ural" Vadim Skripchenko on the eve of the match of the 9th round of the Premier League with Krasnodar noted the variety of attacking schemes of the opposing team.
According to the coach, the Bulls have in their arsenal several models of play in attack.
The fight will take place on September 21 and will start at 16.30 Moscow time.
We will see how we play against Krasnodar, - the official website of "Ural" quotes Skripchenko.
We have a whole week of preparation ahead of us.
This team has different attacking options, conducts its attacks in a variety of ways, at the same time and we are not a slow team, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that Krasnodar are hosting a Europa League match against Borussia Dortmund, we will try very well to prepare to win.
Rocher Kanyas: "Astana can take points away from anyone."
Astana midfielder Rocher Kanyas after the match of the 1st round of the Champions League group stage with Benfica (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
According to the midfielder, on their field Astana are able to take away points from any opponent.
Despite the fact that the match was difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - quotes the official website of UEFA words Kanyas. - We didn't have the courage to attack a little bit.
Benfica are above class, but in the home game, I think we can count on taking away their points.
It's very real.
But first you have to think about Galatasaray and then Atletico.
In home matches we can take points away from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "I repeat as many times: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world".
Real Madrid head coach Rafael Benitez expressed satisfaction with a big victory in the 1st round match of the Champions League group stage with Shakhtar (4-0).
The specialist paid tribute to forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored three goals.
The match was not easy because Shakhtar know how to own the ball, - quotes the official website of UEFA words Benitez.
The opponent did not have many chances, but their counterattacks always hide danger.
I will not say that Real Madrid played perfectly, but we had plenty of scoring opportunities.
I am happy that we did not concede goals and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
He's the best player in the world, I'll say it as many times.
Jordi Alba: "Cristiano Ronaldo can't match Messi."
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes that no one can compare with his team-mate Lionel Messi.
According to the Spaniard, Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo also can not do it.
Messi is five goals above the rest," Le Figaro quoted Alba as saying. "No one can do what Leo is capable of doing.
Not even Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, everything changes, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: Barcelona has not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.
Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi on the eve of the Champions League group stage match with Barcelona noted the importance of compactness and safety in the game against such a strong opponent.

Barcelona is a special opponent, a good team with excellent players," UEFA's official website quoted De Rossi as saying. -
It is difficult to play with blue-granat, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.
To leave them, we will have to plow throughout the match and back each other.
Messi is almost always successful when he's in the stroke, so we need to stay compact and organised.

I hope that I will play in the next match in the starting line-up, - R-Sport quotes Yezhov as saying.
I am not an expert on goalkeepers, I am a goalkeeper myself, we do not show replays of conceded goals, so it is difficult to track.
Dynamo played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team lost anyway.
I'd rather have missed more, but the team won.

Stephen Hogg used girl's phone to force paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to beg for images of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping and registered with the online messaging service, where he received a number of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found the shocking photos, and then immediately drew the attention of her mother.
Police arrived and saw five images, then examined the computers found at the address and found "appropriate" searches on the search engine using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hogg then told police he had done so because it could have "attracted paedophiles" and then he "pretended he was a police officer to scare them."
Eilidh Robertson, prosecuting, told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted making inquiries on his computer, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.
He was interviewed about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him the images and that he had asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had problems with his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see images of rapes and murders.
Ms Robertson added: 'When the girl found the pictures on her phone she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw indecent images on her phone and the defendant was then face-to-face.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused had used a computer and a Play estate to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making indecent photographs of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail conditions on January 25 this year and failing to appear in court on March 24 this year.
The defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sim, applied not to place Hogg on the list of sex offenders because it could be proved that there was no "significant sexual element" in the offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael adjourned sentencing until October, pending inquiries from social services.
Hogg was released on bail in the case but was remanded in custody pending a hearing on other remaining cases.
He was listed as a sex offender before the date of sentencing.
President Robert Mugabe reads the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest state leader, fell down a podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but a video of the scene of the fall immediately spread on social media.
The opening of parliament was also overshadowed by claims by parliamentary opposition activists that they had received anonymous threats warning them against booing Mugabe during the speech.
A month ago, they booed the President during his address to the nation in Parliament; That's exactly what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Goneze, a member of parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning against interrupting Mugabe's speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is entitled "Death,"" he told reporters at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned the noted members of Parliament that immunity ends in the Houses of Parliament, and as soon as they come out, parliamentary immunity does not apply.
The MP said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting program.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the faster-growing hardware and service sectors.
The expected job cuts will amount to about $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard at the moment, and the business portfolio will be broader and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenue of more than $50 billion and "will be focused on providing previously unattainable integrated technology solutions" to companies, the company said in a statement.
This is how the company, formed in the 1930s by Stanford University alumni Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, is divided to produce electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was nicknamed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
Hewlett Packard is in the process of a major reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
Such a move by HP, the world's second-largest manufacturer of personal computers and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest event in the sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies are doing a better job.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his team-mates should support the injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo zagreb
In his conversation with Wilshere, Wenger also stressed that it was only September and that, provided Wilshere's recovery went according to plan, there would be nothing to prevent him from returning to the game by Christmas.
In the most favourable development, Wilshere will definitely miss at least four games in England and, given what happened, his participation in next summer's European Championship remains in doubt.
The most offensive thing about this recent problem is that Wilshere confidently finished the previous season with a single ankle injury and was about to return to his usual aggressive style of play during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury does not threaten his career."
It's just not a fully healed bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or injuries he has had before.
It may be medically related, but as Wenger has also admitted, there is a risk of additional injury for any player returning to the game mid-season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshere has recorded 23 different injuries in the six years since his debut.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games over the past five seasons.
If you look at the situation for Arsenal more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting in 2007-08, Arsenal were one of two Premier League clubs that had the most days missed due to injuries.
Wenger admits there is a possibility of getting stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that the improvement in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you get back in action after an injury, you get vulnerable for a while - during that time you need to recuperate and gain a competitive advantage," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to make it.
I hope he recovers physically, I'm sure of that, as well as that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal begin the Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a match against Dynamo zagreb and will continue with their Saturday games against Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the squad.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey have not arrived in Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to play in the starting line-up.
Wenger may also introduce Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little respite to those players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are the undisputed favourites in Group F, the Maximir Stadium in zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost any of their 41 matches since they managed to play last season as Invincibles.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was hit by a 3.2-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in the city of zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal have learned a lesson from last season when the team lost in a Champions League game against Monaco and remain with little hope of leading the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger said.
Arsenal have never done that before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I am a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that taught us serious lessons in male friendship
The absence of such stories is striking, especially when you consider how desperate men's need for candor has become, now more than ever, even though the suicide rate among young men is at its highest in 15 years.
In 2013, this was the single biggest cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the UK, and men are three times more likely to be women.
In an attempt to understand the problem, the Campaign Against Unhappy Life has declared 2015 the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to take up the challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students who show symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a large enough number of friends "in a normal mood," the chances of a cure are doubled.
Equally for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends halves the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all it is necessary that it was.
In an age when communication is controlled by social networks, when style prefers content, the speed of response is often more valued than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to appear strong, loving and successful, even if loneliness reigns in reality.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which strongly affects our mental health.
And as one billionaire, a video game maker, recently noticed, you can't actually buy more happiness for money.
The advantage of Friends is that they attract attention to it.
Each of the characters was defined not through his work, but rather through the personality that manifested itself in communication with friends.
Joey's humour and Chandler's constant embrace, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross's sighing on Rachel all come from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As a Samaritans employee told me: "... my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal underlines how even the smallest communication of friends can be beneficial."
Often those men who turn to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old teaching of "live with it" is strong, as is the feeling that a frank conversation about problems can be perceived as a weakness."
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-running coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the subtle moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of an outsider talking on the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close circle of family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central this weekend, where the scenery has been fully restored for the holiday, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or better yet - if you see a lonely person at Starbucks, smile and say "Hello."
Do not guess in advance what benefits friendship can bring.
The Series Friends show on Comedy Central from beginning to end, all 236 episodes, on the tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores to help PSG defeat Malmo
Angel di Maria, along with Blaise Matyudi and Edinson Cavani, celebrates scoring goals against Malmo.
Angel di Maria, making his Champions League debut, scored a goal that allowed PSG to easily beat Malmo on Tuesday.
Here is the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job when Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League game with a comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after his first Champions League game as a PSG player to set the way for the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavani scored in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, Paris needed to make a good start in the game against the champions of Sweden, as they aimed not at qualifying for the play-offs, but at the continuation of a series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarter-finals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on Laurent Blanc's part to find zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in attack and later replace him on the pitch in a game against a team from his hometown and the club in which he began his glittering career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, to give the opponents problems and play well in defence - it's a good start, even if there are still moments that we will need to improve during the season," Blanc said.
That's promising.
We wanted to win and we did that, although I wish we had scored one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury in one of the substitutions for the Parisian team, which earned them a 2-2 draw against Bordeaux in The First League at the weekend, but was sidelined by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker was celebrated as a player capable of taking PSG to the next level in Europe after being bought out by Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he ran over a pass from Marco Verratti behind the Malmo defence and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johan Villande into the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected an easy and big victory from PSG, they had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage with nine world-class players on the pitch early in the game, five defenders and two defensive midfielders in midfield, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of Nikola Djurdzic's strike, in which the ball flew past the far post of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they attacked quite a bit.
But PSG at times failed themselves with inconclusive passes and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half could not realize at least five attempts, and then could not process the ball scored by Cavani immediately after the resumption of the game.
However, he proved much more skilful in precise passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, getting which, Di Maria sent the ball swirling blow, which went into the post past Viland in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scoring his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic adjusted the ball sent to the centre of the field from the left flank by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmo had about returning to the game, and only Viland's interception from close range prevented David Luiz from increasing the final score before substitute Ezequel Lavezzi scored a goal at the very end of the match.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, with the Norwegian saying: "Our last game in the Champions League took place last December."
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, and this is not the level.
The qualifications are not enough.
Kudos to "Paris"!
It was a wonderful match against them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion in share sale
Switzerland-based mining and trading giant Glencore, hit by falling commodity prices, has made $2.5 billion in share sales as part of its ambitious plan to reduce debt.
The London Stock Exchange-listed company Glencore has announced that it has sold new shares worth around 1.6 billion pounds to pay off the debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value, is struggling to cope with a collapse in commodity prices while China's economic slowdown worsens demand and creates chaos in global markets.
With the release of new shares at a discounted price, Glencore's share price on the London Stock Exchange soared in early morning trading on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 per cent to 131.60p on the FTSE 100 index, which was trading 0.69 per cent higher at the opening.
Glencore last week began selling $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of extensive plans to reduce its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company was selling new shares at 125 cents apiece, a discount of 2.4 percent to the close at the close of trading on Tuesday.
It placed 1.3 billion new shares, representing 9.99 percent of the company's share capital.
The cost of iron ore fell by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials fell by 20-40 per cent due to fears of a continuing downturn in the Chinese economy.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official statement that Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive on an official visit to the United States later this month.
The visit - Xi Jinping's first visit to Washington - will take place on September 25 and will be a return visit to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and first lady Michelle Obama will also welcome Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan to a government dinner later that day after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, as well as allow the presidents of the United States and China to engage constructively in addressing controversial topics," the statement said.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with the heads of several leading U.S. technology companies en route to Washington before heading to New York to attend the September U.N. General Assembly.
Obama and Xi Jinping are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber espionage and China's growing categorical nature on the disputed South China Sea.
The biker who shot down in Kutuzovsky was sentenced to two years in prison.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims against Denis Mirzoyev for the sum of 1.2 million rubles.
The Dorogomilov court in Moscow handed down the sentence of Denis Mirzoyev, who fatally shot a motorcyclist on Kutuzovsky Avenue in Moscow.
Mirzoyev was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in a settlement colony.
He was found guilty under the article "Violation of traffic rules and operation of vehicles" of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims worth 1.2 million rubles.
During the debates of the parties, the prosecutor asked to sentence Mirzoyev to three years in prison and to collect from him the claims of the victims in full - eight million rubles.
The accident in question occurred on May 22 at about 3 a.m. in the area of house 30 on Kutuzovsky Avenue.
The BMW, driven by Mirzoyev, crossed the oncoming lane and hit a motorcyclist standing on the side of the road.
The man, born in 1989, died at the scene from his injuries.
Friends of the victim on social networks reported that the driver of the BMW was driving at high speed and before the accident drove into the oncoming lane.
Fearing that the driver would try to evade responsibility, the bikers organized a motorcycle race from the Sparrow Mountains to the building of the Moscow police department on Petrovka, 38.
Shortly thereafter, it became known that the investigation after the interrogation detained the alleged culprit of the accident.
In Moscow, a naked man came to the temple.
He behaved calmly and did not commit any wrongdoing, the police handed him over to emergency psychiatric doctors.
Officers of the Metropolitan Police detained a resident of Moscow, who entered one of the temples without clothes.
This is reported by the agency "Moscow."
According to Andrei Galiakberov, the head of the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow, the incident took place on Tuesday, September 15, at about 4 p.m., on the Kashir Highway.
A naked man entered the temple of St. Nicholas.
He behaved calmly and did not commit any illegal acts.
A police squad arrived at the scene on call.
Law enforcement officers waited for doctors from the emergency psychiatric team and handed them over to the man.
It turned out to be a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
More than 40 decrees and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 decrees and orders were signed by the governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev at a meeting of the presidium of the regional government.
Some of them related to the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, funds were allocated for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools in the Nizhnetavdin district, for the overhaul of the regional hospital in the Kazan region.
According to the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the overhaul of the second floor of the therapeutic department.
The hot and cold water supply networks, drainage, power grids and electrical equipment, ventilation systems, the facade of the building will be repaired, the premises will be repaired, and a set of fire safety and energy-saving measures will be carried out.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On September 17-18, the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, where the Tyumen delegation headed by the governor will take part.
Vladimir Shuglya, the honorary consul general of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen, who was a member of the official delegation, talks about the upcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of the cooperation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the objectives of the Sochi Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on the fruitful cooperation of the regions - important links in relations between the two states.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko are expected to take part in the plenary session.
The plenary and breakout sessions will focus on the experience of regional and local authorities in Russia and Belarus in implementing industrial policy, on regulatory enforcement and programs of the Union State.
The governor of the Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I think this is a testament to the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also come to the forum.
There will be trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new lucrative contracts and agreements.
I would like to add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
More than two hundred delegates participated in its work, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important cooperation agreement was signed between the Tyumen and Minsk regions.
The importance of our developments is also evidenced by the fact that a permanent seminar was held in Tyumen at the parliamentary meeting of the Union of Russia and Belarus.
In addition, the delegation of the APC of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in training for agriculture, identify additional points of contact and organize new investment projects in the field of agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the governor of the Tyumen region, Vladimir Yakushev, it was about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in today's difficult conditions.
The issue of supplying Belarusian agricultural equipment and using financial mechanisms will be touched upon - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the end consumer.
The problems in the work of belshina's Tyumen trading house and options for preventing losses were discussed.
The issues are important, as investment projects should work clearly and bring profit to the region.
It was said about the further supply of passenger-cargo equipment of "MAS" and the development of the service center of "MAS" which was established in Tyumen on the basis of TPATP.
The conversation also touched on the preparation of the region's working delegation to Belarus before the end of this year.
Another topic of the conversation was the completion of the agreement and the signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promises to reach a new level.
These questions also concerned the regional center.
During the meeting with the head of the administration of the city of Tyumen, Alexander Moor, we talked about the renewal of the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already "breathing on incense" because a new batch of cars from Belarus is required, which will run on gas, environmentally friendly fuel.
Another aspect: The Tyumen Elevator Plant is cooperating with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products, Mogilevliftmash, receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the programs to install new elevators in the regional center.
I would like to add that within the framework of the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the governor of the Kurgan region, Aleksey Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing the turnover and supply of modern Belarusian equipment was discussed.
A meeting with the Omsk governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of district headquarters.
The region is a testing ground for many promising projects, including the work of the honorary consul general.
In general, such meetings are significant and good because they allow to directly and quickly solve many problems, removing their severity and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current climate, it is extremely important not to destroy the backlog, continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon opposes focusing on the ethnic diversity of people involved in filmmaking
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying backstage that there was no need to take into account the ethnic line-up.
During Sunday's release of Project Greenlight on HBO, the famous actor interrupted Brown as she tried to emphasize the need for alternative perspectives on the lead black character in the script chosen for the project.
"Diversity is appropriate when you're casting for the movie itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
Stunned Brown, not believing his ears, resentfully exclaimed "Wow! Wow, that's fine. Well, all the time, while the actor from "The Martian" was making comments live.
Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I would like the participants - no matter who the director is - to think about what interpretation of Harmony's image they are going to follow," Brown said at the start of the discussion.
The only black character - a prostitute, which is beaten by a white pimp.
The film's producer Dear White People advocated for Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio to be the film's directors; Damon was vehemently opposed, saying that "in the end, we can get the wrong thing."
After the debate was televised, social media exploded with disapproving comments about Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni angrily spoke out about the video: "Explaining the essence of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in the room THAT REALLY REALLY hurts."
The tweet garnered more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "likes."
Damon's remarks come at a time when literate media coverage of racial issues is the most pressing issue on the public debate agenda.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminating against people of color.
In February, singer Prince mentioned the move during a nomination for Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and the lives of blacks, albums still matter.
More recently, Black Lives Matter leaders issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News staffer Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group would be treated as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a group of love," the movement's leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of showbiz figures, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards the first champion
Professional climber and assistant waiter Isaac Caldiero on Monday night became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior", taking home the prize of 1 million dollars.
At this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants managed to pass all the stages of the track with obstacles.
In the season finale, two contestants - Caldiero and cameraman Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final challenge included climbing a 75-foot-long rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task first and met the set time, becoming the first athlete in the history of "American Ninja Warrior" to pass the grueling stage 4, but Caldiero coped with the task as much as three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
After the victory, which was won with incredible difficulty, Caldiero, who was shocked that he won a million dollars, gave an interview to "E! News".
"To think about it is incredible, I have never earned or lived on more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! such a serious jump in their income.
And all of a sudden... I never even imagined how it happened... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed met with Reporter come to talk about the finale and why Britten, who was the first to pass the track, would not receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, the money gets the fastest participant.
"If there are more than one finisher, the prize gets the fastest of them," Weed said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life-changing, it still gets great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels offended about it.
He's happy with what he's done.
He received tons of rave reviews from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was meant to lose to someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if we had swapped roles.
"America Ninja Warrior" will return with its eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers quietly bypass Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn't been particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers now ranks last in the American League's Central Division.
The Tigers won 5-4 at Target Field on Tuesday with a 5-4 win over the Minnesota Twins.
The Twins missed a chance to cut a half-game lead behind the Houston Astros and finish second in the playoffs by points after the winners.
For the Detroiters, even for one night, it was the return of the F-word that eluded them for much of the second half of the season.
"All the wins are fun, no matter how they turn out," Tigers manager Brad Osmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon contributed to the attack, leading Detroit to score three points in the first two innings, then added another in the sixth and one out in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three runs.
It was only his third quality start in nine outings.
"I just want to finish the year with good performance," Simon said.
Pitchers on the substitutes can't throw in every game, so I want to get deeper into the game.
Tigers slugger Victor Martinez hit three hits and had two hits - his first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strikeouts since four hits in a game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with the bat," Osmus said.
He performed well in (quality batter), noticeably better at bat and kept that quality for the game.
With three runs in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to get back into the game.
Center host Byron Buxton opened the inning with a double on the left field line.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks took the first base with a bant, and second baseman Brian Dozier got a strikeout on a swing from Simon before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy outscored Moera, the only player on the way, ahead of new-time slugger Miguel Sano, who struck out a two-run single to left by right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners out and a par-par second base, Verhagen managed to lead third baseman Trevor Plouffe to the double play.
It was the 27th time for a major league player this season when Plouffe kicked the ball to a double play.
After Detroit added a back-to-back injury in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned an RBI double into space between outfielders against Tigers backup Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-hander knocked out Sano after three strikes and got his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of phil Hughes, who was temporarily out of practice early in the game.
The Tigers earned three runs in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the injured list until the game, missing more than a month due to lower back inflammation.
"Definitely not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots in the third inning."
After the first batter reached first base, Hughes threw a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Walker with two outs of the isterfielder J. D. Martinez brought out Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series "0 for 21" with runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed up a single, causing another injury, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to get closer to third base, thus eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the score in the second inning with a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center slugger Anthony Goose, and it was 3-0.
"It was a massive hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit particularly well, but he hit right at the right point.
Hughes, whose throws were counted, threw in the no-scoring third inning before being replaced by right-handed relayer A.J. It's Akhter.
Hughes tallied three hits on six hits and a four-run strikeout.
NOTES: Tigers right-hander Anibal Sanchez was out of the game due to a sprained right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who underwent shoulder surgery on Sanchez back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to start Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and play against the Twins.
Norris, who has faced the Tigers in four starts since his acquisition in exchange for left-handed pitcher David Price on July 30, has one win and one loss.
He hasn't played in a game since August 20 because of a sprained muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will complete a three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play pitcher-right-hander Ervin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint of Kadyrov on the book "Praying to God" was submitted to the South Sakhalin court.
The South Sakhalin City Court received the original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov on the decision to recognize the book "Praying to God: its meaning and place in Islam" as "extremist material", Interfax reports, citing the chairman of the city court Alexander Chukhrai.
Now the court is waiting for possible objections of the participants of the trial.
Chukhrai refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation about the need to check the magistrates for possible cooperation with foreign special services and ISIL.
"Let them comment on such nonsense," he said.
On September 11, the South Sakhalin City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalia Perchenko's decision to recognize the book as "extremist material."
An appeal was filed by the prosecutor's office in South Sakhalinsk on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to recognize as extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, and not verses from the Koran.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge made the wrong decision," Chukhrai said.
The decision to recognize the book as "extremist material" was taken on August 12, 2015.
In particular, "extremist" were called quotes from the Koran - "You we worship and you beg for help," "Do not call to anyone along with Allah."
Kadyrov called the decision-making "shaytans and provocateurs."
He called on the State Duma deputies to ban judicial decisions concerning the texts of the sacred scriptures.
"I firmly believe that the State Duma should pass a law that prohibits judicial decisions concerning the texts of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures," Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram.
Facebook will delete comments insulting migrants and refugees
Facebook staff intend to delete posts and comments that give a negative assessment of migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints of users on illegal content.
The leadership of Facebook intends to fight xenophobia and racism in the network together with the German Ministry of Justice.
Thus, the head of the department Heiko Maas said that the Ministry of Justice is currently working with specialists of the social network to create a special group of moderators.
Its members are required to monitor and remove inappropriate comments about migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is expected that the authors of non-tolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for the deletion of their record.
Organizations whose specialists collect complaints from users of the social network about offensive posts should also facilitate the prompt blocking of illegal content.
The management of Facebook intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative comments about migrants and refugees was taken by the leadership of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice after xenophobic sentiments rose sharply in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that engulfed the EU countries some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all the accommodation centres are already overcrowded.
The day before, the authorities decided to temporarily resettle migrants in the territory of the former concentration camp Buchenwald.
Displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
There will be relaxation zones in Moscow cemeteries.
In the near future, several of the capital's cemeteries will be equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be Butovskoye, Domodedovo, and Scherbin cemetery.
The first zone for psychological rest has already appeared at the Troyekurov cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar sites will appear in other areas of the city.
Artem Ekimov, who holds the position of head of the State Budget Office "Ritual" told the m24.ru portal.
Relaxation zones will be small green areas resembling parks.
According to experts, in such "corners" visitors to cemeteries will be able to relax, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in Domodedovsk, Butovsky and Scherbinsky cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the GBU "Ritual", if there is a need to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing woodlands as much as possible.
The green spaces will serve as a living fence, which will separate the recreation areas and the area reserved directly for the burial sites.
Experts of HBU "Ritual" also announced their intention to make a proposal to abandon hedges at burial sites.
New cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, the GBU "Ritual" was told about the readiness to install electronic terminals, with which visitors to cemeteries will be able to learn GPS coordinates and license plates of burials.
In June of this year, the GBU "Ritual" also proposed to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of year.
Thus, digging a grave in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, a week in winter, when the ground is frozen.
It should be noted that over the past year, prices for all types of ritual services have risen by an average of 10 percent.
Five days later they found a lost mushroom picker in the Yelnin forests.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours without provisions in the forest.
It was possible to find the mountain-mushroom thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
No food or water.
Relatives, rescuers and volunteers were looking for him.
There were even dog handlers, but there was no result.
The man was found after a helicopter was involved in the search.
On that day Vitaly Alexandrovitch as usual went to the forest for the otops and sub-beberezoviks, but by the evening he did not return.
Relatives immediately appealed for help, and the next day in search of the mushroom picker were raised rescuers and caring residents from the neighboring village - only about 30 people.
On the fifth day they were joined by a helicopter of the fire and rescue center.
Andrey Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the Smolensk Region Fire and Rescue Center, said: "The helicopter was involved, the man was found."
Gone very far, completely elsewhere.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He walked a huge distance at his age.
Miraculously survived.
Mushroom was taken to the Yelnin Central District Hospital unconscious, in a very serious condition.
Medics diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia.
How an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days spent in the woods, doctors do not represent.
Valentina Napsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Yellin CRB: "A patient's examination is scheduled, treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition in the morning has improved, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Aleksandrovich comes to Smolensk every year from the Tambov region.
His grandson says that his grandfather had ever gone to pick mushrooms before, but he had never gone far into the forest.
Alexey Spitchenko, grandson of the mushroom picker found, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, it is not local in principle."
Literally a few years came to visit, visit relatives.
Well, I went for mushrooms.
Apparently, he went far and got lost.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
In the last few days alone, five similar cases.
Rescuers remind: in the forest you need to go in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches and a compass.
In addition, it is advisable to leave traces behind you so that you can then go back.
The emergency An-2 sat on a sage in the brotherly taiga.
Right on the gap sat in Siberia emergency An-2.
The plane of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Yenisei" made an emergency landing 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no fatalities or injuries, but the plane itself suffered significant damage when it landed.
An-2 was on a service flight.
Three crew members - the commander, the co-pilot and the flight mechanic - were on board, Interfax reported.
The emergency plane was flying on the route of the zeleznogorsk-Ilimsky - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The Fraternal Transport Prosecutor's Office, after the emergency landing of the An-2, began checking compliance with the aviation safety legislation.
An investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor's Office went to the scene.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed their plane with passengers due to a technical fault at an abandoned taiga airfield in Komi.
The liner failed engines and on-board electronics, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured in the emergency landing of the plane.
Leading the Economy - Nobel Laureate: Globalization
Printing the processes of globalization were supposed to help reduce inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation looks different, the difference in incomes of the population in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To fix this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, said Erik Maskin, chief scientist of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Solutions at the HSE.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Proponents of globalization have predicted great benefits for emerging economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many ways," Maskin stresses.
For example, China and India have received serious GDP growth per capita.
However, not everything is so rosy.
Globalization was expected to narrow the gap between the "haves" and the "have-nots" in poor countries, which manifested itself in a large income inequality, or rather, of wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why Global Markets Have Not Reduced Inequality in Emerging Economies", published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and quoted by the HSE Research Institute.
Together with The Economist, Harvard Professor Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income disparities in poor countries increase as globalization increases, the HSE Research Institute reminds.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin allocates four skill levels - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries lacked the skill level to cooperate with specialists A and B from rich countries.
And if workers in the C level from poor countries are increasing their wages through cooperation with B-rich employees, D-workers are not feeling the growth or their wages are falling at all.
The overall effect is that the internationalization of production will increase the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, consequently, increase inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin offered a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It helps to explain why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, ordinary professor, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Solutions, head of the Department of Mathematics at the HSE Research Institute.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Erik Maskin, is to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the means to do so, and it is unprofitable for companies to pay for their training.
Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations can play a significant role in such a situation, Maskin said.
The scientist notes that the developed theory in no way calls for a halt to the process of globalization, which has brought and bears fruit in the form of GDP growth of countries.
Derbent: The living bond of the times.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, celebrates its 2,000th anniversary in September.
The program of festive events includes the festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of the past, an exhibition of Derbent carpets and open temple day, a historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed museum of Peter I.
Medieval stones of Naryn-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all this seems to have come down from the pages of "A Thousand and One Nights."
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has remained in its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Hazara Kaganate and The Golden Horde.
The age of the eastern sycamores, which grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mosque, is several centuries old.
These powerful plants are protected by the All-Russian program "Trees - Monuments of Wildlife."
The shadow of the sprawling crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The visitor of the mosque will be poured fragrant tea and treated to Dagestan treats - honey figs, persimmons, musmula, tortillas-miracle, ayran and sweets.
In Derbent for centuries used large samovars to drink tea at one time numerous guests.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 Hijri.
That is, in 733 on the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking in scope and solemnity: arcades of domes and vaults rest on square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
The maintenance and breeding of pigeons is a traditional hobby of Derbent residents.
Pet poultry owners put pigeons in yards, under trees, in attics.
Spectacular sight - take to the sky a flock of white pigeons, similar to the flashes of festive fireworks.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian gate with a double stone wall.
Leaving 500 meters into the sea, this structure locked the harbor of Derbent.
In 2003, the walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets in Derbent were woven back in the 5th century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market are sold carpets for all tastes - palas of wool, cotton or felt of all colors and shades, with a pile and without it, with a complex ornament and a fancy border.
The development of the city began with magals - blocks with single-storey stone buildings.
Over the years, the magals have hardly changed.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioning on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in a medieval, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city preserved details of the water pipe, built by the Persians about a thousand years ago.
Ancient springs have survived to this day, where the locals are still gaining water.
Many derbentz prefer regular water from taps to water from proven historical fountains.
In Derbent was one of the centers of pottery.
Water and painted vases, dishes, jugs, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of potters still make wonderful ceramic products, both practical and souvenir.
On holidays and festivals, crowds gather under a tightrope where students of the Republican School of Circus Arts perform.
The history of amazing and risky craftsmanship goes back several centuries.
A new trend - among tightrope walkers are increasingly seen girls.
The former Maiden Bath is now home to the Museum "Culture and Life of Ancient Derbent."
Previously, unmarried girls and brides were washed here accompanied by girlfriends, but now anyone can see the vaulted and domed hall, hot and cold pools, gone in the past accessories for swimming.
Most of Derbent's houses have hot water, but baths and doubles these days are as popular as they were in the old days.
The ferry is written in old books about the benefits of warming the body.
After the bath blood improves, muscles lose fatigue, the body acquires flexibility and lightness.
The Commonwealth Festival, which takes place in the naryn-Kala fortress, is attended by ethno-palaces in many parts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, perform songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and treat visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
Kyrkhlar is the burial place of forty martyrs who laid their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
Yellowed from time sarcophagi are carved from solid stone blocks and oriented, as is customary in the Arabs, on the axis of the west-east.
Brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubov cut and shave customers in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The barbershop has been in this place for many years.
The techniques of the barber's craft are passed down from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Yakubov brothers can make not only traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old City, the house where the exiled Writer-Decabrist Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky lived lived.
Having learn the Turkic language and collected ethnographic material, he described Derbent of the first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, the life and life of the townspeople.
Chaihana is a traditional club of the East, which serves only tea and home pastries.
Men come here to quench their thirst, chat with friends and solve some work problems.
As in past times, women cross the threshold of teahouses is not recommended.
The Derbent dance ensemble "Caspius" was created three years ago, but has already managed to take part in the events of the republican and Russian level.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, learning perfectly folk Avar, Dargin, Tat, Armenian dances.
With the onset of the evening, when the noise subsides and street lights are lit, the locals sit on benches near the houses with protruding terraces.
As a rule, derbentzs discuss domestic issues.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they increasingly recall episodes of the unique history of their city, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
Domodedov hosted a business "airport game."
A new form of education is being tested in the capital.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport employees.
To do this, the Domodedova installed models of three air harbors.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also served planes.
All this is in the form of a business game, but in complexity it was not inferior to reality.
Late flights, just two passengers with fractures on board, the ladder was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
It's hell for a real airport.
For the one that settled in the hangar Domodedov - a standard set of tasks that will be solved by newcomers.
Three large airports from around the world fit in one hangar.
Today they employ four hundred students from the capital's colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn all about the inner world of air harbor.
Check-in passengers, maintenance of planes, turnover of luggage - they were entrusted even buses on the flight field, ladders and screening of passengers.
And the passengers are all problematic.
One was in a mess with the documents, the other was late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious objects.
And it is necessary to deal with all this, as in life - in the minimum term.
For each of these completed tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual money, as if the airline paid them the appropriate amount for the maintenance of the flight.
"They are fined for failing to meet the relevant tasks," Dmitry Hilko, the game's financial analyst, explains in an interview with Vesti-Moscow.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely monitoring the events.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try out a new form of study.
She has already found a place in the course of secondary vocational education.
"Six inter-regional competence centers will be formed, which will become, in fact, new models of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment," says Natalia Solotareva, Director of the Department of Public Policy in the field of training of workers and additional vocational education of the Russian Ministry of Science.
But students - not up to global plans.
After three days of training, they seem to need a day off.
But the grades for this exam had quite a material expression.
The newest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for answering the claim to our airport on Instagram in a timely manner," - Sergey Shuvalov, PR manager of the Frankfurt Airport team, is pleased with the game.
The best judges, as they say, took a pencil to invite to his work by the time they finished their studies.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret over the closure of the American Center for Foreign Literature, which operated at the Library of Foreign Literature.
The center has been operating in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American center of the U.S. Embassy at the All-Russian State Library of Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by Russia in recent times call into question the Russian government's commitment to the Russian-American people' ties, which were not interrupted even during the Cold War and at other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries," U.S. Ambassador John Tefft said in a statement to Interfax.
The American Center has built deep and strong ties between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was a center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and served as a meeting place with numerous American dignitaries, including cosmonauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Last year alone, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50,000 Russian visitors," the diplomat said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program) educational exchange program.
The Green Tribunal was quick to crack down.
Typical situation: four officials stand in front of the table of Judge Swatanter Kumar, listening to his claims to the work done.
The court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order to make fun of him," Kumar said. -
If there is at least one more brick, we will order to demolish all existing buildings.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NRT), a judicial body established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has dealt with more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to halt the construction leading to the contamination.
The stakes are incredibly high: in the less than 60 years since the declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development, India has evolved from a virgin jungle country into one of the most overcrowded and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large megacities, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste of enterprises and households, and few remaining residential areas are cut down for construction by new residential areas.
Despite the state's formal support for the green movement, the NRT has been regularly criticized by Narendra Modi's government, as it is often the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May this year, for example, the Minister of the Environment called the court's decisions "extreme" and "impossible".
Sometimes the court's decisions are really impossible to execute within the court's deadline, confirms raj Panjwani, an environmental lawyer.
However, impossible deadlines have a positive side: at least, they make the responsible persons move.
"His main goal is to shake up this system," the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly cancelled major construction projects, halting the construction of the airport, power plant and hundreds of smaller structures.
At the same time, people try not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of the pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnana, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We may close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," Kumar said.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can change thanks to one stroke of the judge's pen.
In April, for example, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over the age of 10 from entering the capital, which caused national outrage.
Despite plummeting popularity and a barrage of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to reverse the decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics on incoming and departing vehicles from the Delhi government, and made an offer to purchase 10,000 additional buses after learning from factories whether they were able to carry out such an order.
As sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even road incidents began to fall into the attention of the courts, the popular anger began to subside.
But the most painful topic of the principled judge was the program to clean up the Ganges River, with fanfare announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and proceeds to shout.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges on the statue of God, and it was faeces - the judge is hot. -
You keep polluting the river because you think: The Ganges are the Ganges, it will take away all our sins.
This is the river that we worship and see what you do with it every day.
The Ganges clean-up is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm by more than 120 times.
Every year, between 1.5 and 3 out of 700 million Hindus bathed in it die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money from the sale of his costume, in which he met Barack Obama and 455 items from his personal collection, to the Ganges Rescue Foundation.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for $700,000, while the clean-up of the river required at least eight billion.
The proponents of the Green Tribunal agree that India still has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but do not believe that the cost of progress should be ecology.
"In a developing country, talking about the environment is often perceived as an unaffordable luxury," said Malika Bhanoth, an activist with the Ganges. -
And the court is trying to find a middle ground between ecology and development."
A man bleeds several of Dali's paintings at an exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the exhibition of the Latvian Union of Artists in Riga broke the windows of the museum and spoiled Salvador Dali's sculpture "The Appearance of an Angel".
The museum now hosts an exhibition of works by Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
A man born in 1985 entered the sculpture hall at 2:20 p.m.
He immediately led inadequately: spoiled the sculpture, broke the windows.
Then he began to move around the premises and stained with blood several works of permanent exposition.
Among them is a portrait of Poruk by Miervaldis Polis.
According to the president of the Latvian Union of Artists, Igor Dobychin, referred to by Interfax, the windows were also damaged.
Police and art experts are working at the scene.
The latter determine the extent of damage and damage.
A criminal case of hooliganism has been opened against the man.
The Latvian Union of Artists hosts an exhibition of Picasso and Dali's works from August 4 to September 27, featuring more than 200 original works by artists.

Xi Jinping calls for making economy more open to the world
The economy must become more open to the world to spur growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in an address to a group tasked with leading reforms.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop a policy of openness," he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Leading Group on Comprehensive Deepening reforms.
According to him, the expansion of openness and deepening reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group has adopted a number of directives, including regulating investor access to the market, changing border controls, promoting public enterprises (SOEs) that attract private capital and revising the logging system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually re-made through trial programs.
This is an important step because it will give the market a greater role in resource allocation, business rule and openness, the statement said.
The Government will also loosen its control over the powers given to companies, thereby ensuring that the companies themselves conduct their business.
