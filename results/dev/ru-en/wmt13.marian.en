Republican Strategy for Resistance to Re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat falsifications in elections.
However, the Brennan Center considers the last myth, claiming that cases of fraud in elections in the United States are more rare than deaths from lightning.
In addition, the Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral frauds in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this regard, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have been adopting laws that complicate the process of registration or voting since 2009.
This phenomenon gained a new scale after the elections in November 2010, which brought to the Republicans 675 new places in 26 states.
As a result, in one 2011, 180 bills were adopted, limiting the right to vote in 41 states.
New electoral laws require the voter to present an identity card with a photo and proof of the presence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to register a voter on the day of expression of will and take away the right to vote from citizens who have a conviction.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state obliged voters to present an identity card with a photo.
Indiana was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law adopted in Indiana.
The Republican authorities hurried to extend this practice to other states as well.
In the last two years, they initiated bills requiring voters to present identity cards with a photo, in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a card of health insurance.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people who have reached the age required for voting, do not have a photo ID issued by the government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds one hundred dollars.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $ 35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years old and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the required identity card with photography.
But that's not all.
Students - voters who are considered to vote for democratic candidates, in several states are not allowed to use the identity card with a photo given by their educational institution.
But these same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use certificates issued by these clubs for voting.
Until 2004, no state demanded evidence of American citizenship for voting.
For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States.
These measures obviously aim to limit the vote of natives from Latin America.
It is believed that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the republican legislators initiated in 2011 laws abolishing the registration of voters on voting day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This restriction has not passed without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections the electoral campaign for registration of voters helped to add about 10 million citizens to the lists.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 led to a drop of 17% of the level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the republican legislators adopted in five other states laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
Thus, during the general elections of 2008 in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early were African Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.
The same happened with natives of Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of the citizens who voted ahead of schedule.
Unlike the whites, which, forming 76% of the voters, were only 46% of the voters who voted ahead of schedule.
Of course, the democrat legislators and their supporters actively oppose the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were vetoed by democrat governors.
The most ambiguous laws were suspended when the General Prosecutor of the United States intervened.
This allowed to partially limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted laws requiring presentation of an identity card with a photo.
Nevertheless, the new rules that have come into force will certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote at the 2012 elections.
Critics from the Democrats condemn the bias of the laws that have been adopted, seeing in them an obvious focus on influencing the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The report of the Center of Brennan of 2011 demonstrates that the states that adopted these laws represent 171 out of 270 votes needed at the board of electors to win the presidential election.
It is too early to assert with confidence that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections of 2012.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this regard, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Candid Rescribing: to pass the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives erroneous results, pseudo-shengeative, and sometimes falsepositive, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctantly passing the dispensation, there is something to doubt even more.
Going the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there were numerous cases of infection among groups of researchers, so the data obtained is difficult to interpret and difficult to develop any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, has found different levels of mortality in those patients who have been screening, and those who did not pass it.
This study also showed, after a 12-year observation, that the likelihood of metastasis is 30-40% higher for those who have not passed screening.
Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test starting from 50 years, or with 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin are also subject to increased risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and sluggish.
The patient needs to explain the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without the obligatory treatment of prostate cancer, which is not a danger to life in the long run, and making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active monitoring of the disease.
To date, many men who have cancer will not undergo a treatment course, as their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active observation, and if the disease starts to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly, we accurately define the criteria for deciding on who should or should not undergo a treatment course.
Thus, I would recommend to pass the test.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not to pass this test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Surgology, Moember created a tool that allows you to evaluate everything for and against passing the test on the PSA.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle reception to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, compliance with a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people eat well and move enough, 30% of cases of crust could be prevented.
"If no one else smoked, this figure would increase to at least 50%," stresses André Bole, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, according to estimates, 10% of cancer cases are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It harms people's health tremendously.
"Even today in Quebec there are 1.5 million smokers," - says the spokesman André Bole.
An encouraging fact: 10 years after the renunciation of smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the appearance of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," adds the Association.
Powering
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities it increases the risks of colon cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or sain can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The last can harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," the Association explains.
Vitami
In recent years, many scientists have been engaged in researching the effects of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at the moment the results of these studies cannot be called unequivocal.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give controversial results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In the assessment of the effect on the development of vitamin D cancer, there is also no clearness.
However, Mr. Bolshoi emphasizes that it is important to discuss his anxiety and family history with a doctor.
"The test does not lead to cancer."
Bozon Higgs in detail
Last summer, the report that the scientists may have managed to find the bozon Higgs, caused a real excitement - and not without reason.
It is believed that this bozon explains the mass of all particles in the Universe, not much.
In addition, this is the last particle, the existence of which was predicted within the framework of the Standard model - our best, or, at least, the "have the least imperfect" description of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not been previously experienced.
But physicists are not yet fully sure that it is the bozone of Higgs.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it strongly resembles the bozon Higgs, predicted by the Standard model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at one major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although for the full confidence of some data is not yet available.
Let us imagine that we are talking about the bosom of Higgs, as the chances of mistakes seem minimal, and see what it means.
There is, in this world one law is quite inevitable, which states that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
By bya, this rule is not possible, do not even try too hard, otherwise you will harm yourself.
But although the physics of elementary particles is a rather strange world, it also has one law of a similar nature: the principle of exclusion of Paulie, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" is, in general, in some of their characteristics.
On this basis, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called ferments, who prudently obey the Paulian principle.
In the other fuss bozones, the heinous gang of anarchists, who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can calmly be in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (by the way, completely extraordinary) Particle Adventure Berkeley Lab, these bozones are divided, in turn, into two groups: mezzans, which we will not talk about here, and "particles of force," through which the main forces of nature spread and to which in some way belongs Bozon Higgs.
These very bozones, it should be emphasized, not all such exotic creatures, as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal bozone: a photon, or "particle of light," which is a "courier" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "breaks" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, approximately like a stone thrown into the pond.
From this "violation" is born electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and, therefore, one of the bozones of "power carriers."
A more stable field
The same happens to the bozon of Higgs, with the only difference that in order for this bozon to appear, there must be "breaked" another field, the field of Higgs.
However, the field of Higgs is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to extly it, it is necessary to achieve very and very high energies, as if it were about a frozen pond, the surface of which could shake only a very large stone.
That is why a huge particle accelerator is needed, as the one that is operated in CERN - the Great Adron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such huge energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the bosun Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others - no: a sheet of paper, for example, will never stay on the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact, have mass, while others (as a photon, by the way) do not have it.
So, what "can bring" all these studies, asks Mrs. Plomondon?
In science they are used to check the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to find a discrepancy between the results of observations and forecasts of CM.
In addition, some of them are eager to find such a divergence, because the slightest discrepancy can open the door for "new physics" and shut up some of the holes of Models.
The latter, I must say, still has significant flaws, not offering any explanation for gravity (oh!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the Universe (oh!).
But so far, CERN has not found such a split.
Effects
The use of these studies for the daily life of the average person is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: in the early 60s, laser pioneers in the laboratories of Bella could not even assume what revolution they would cause their work.
They foresaw their applications in science, but no more than that.
In fact, the already late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the laboratories of Bella, where in 1960 was invented laser, and which himself developed the first continuous laser (presighted were pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was originally considered rather as a "laboratory gadget."
Imagine...
And in addition, the application can be found for the tools that accompany the study.
For example, the same Willard Boyle during his optical studies in 1969 developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it was not its original purpose, now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras of the world and deserved the Nobel Prize in Physics of 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adron Collider will definitely change our life, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care - the best way to die... "Down"
The Commission for Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed a delicate issue of the end of life.
Debates should soon resume, and at that time the draft law is being prepared.
Nevertheless, much is yet to be done in this important area.
"Dong" tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. He lived another in his apartment in Monteregi.
The prostate cancer, which destroyed it from within, gave him a two-hedwar deferral.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the or place of the Palliative Care of Victor-Gadbua in Bely, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for it," he says.
The disease does its job: incredible weakness, which does not allow yourself to go to the toilet and even eat on their own.
Sitting at the table on which the appetizing dinner stands, he gives up and agrees to help him eat.
He is awake, even managed to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicines, lead him to a bath.
Courage before normal death.
"My biggest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he confesses.
A few hours later, the staff found a medicine for this disease.
"During our life we are taught that a man should urinate standing," - says Pierre Broder, a psychologist in the shelter of Victor-Gadbua.
Regress to the condition of the child - for some unbearable humiliation.
"Everything depends on the ability of man" to accept the decline," he says.
Since, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliative care, important events are happening in the midst of this decline.
Patients who enter the palliative shelter of Victor-Gadbua, all are suffering from cancer.
The forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide more assistance called "treated."
Ms. A., 89 years old, is most afraid to die "in consciousness from suffocation."
But the disease allowed me to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life," she says before letting her put a mask that relieves her of breathing.
She is still waiting in the coming days of the last visit of her son, who came from Italy.
In the shelter of Victor-Gadbua with the help of a group of volunteers provide body care and nutritional assistance.
This is the palliative care that remains when nothing can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, every 11,700 inhabitants account for one place in palliative care facilities.
This is very little, given that sooner or later we will all die.
Here life continues in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel - one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it's physical, emotional or mental comfort.
Dies we will agree to provide mouth stripes from brandy or peps, looking to ask.
Diabetes are no longer comparing to control the sugar level.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought the beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
In the morning his son did this beer in the feet of the deceased.
"We help our relatives, as well as patients," says Nataly Savar, Director of Care for Patients.
In the shelter of Victor-Gadbua no one day is similar to the previous one.
Next to the 93-year-old, who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, sitting on his pillows while toast in his honor, tragically dies young man 36 years old, surrounded by parents, wife and two young children and tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months from three to five beds, always occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients accepted in the shelter of Victor-Gadbua arrive from home, and 47% of the hospital.
The problem of accessing palliative care
It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care, which is provided to alleviate the suffering of the sick who entered the final stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the shelter.
And some institutions, such as the shelter of Victor-Gadbua and the Society of Palliative Care at the Big Montreal House, specialize more or less exclusively for the care of cancer patients.
It is this big gap in the health system of Quebec makes many doctors - palliative care specialists to fear the adoption of a law legalizing euthanasia and help in suicide.
Since October, the manifesto has been circulating, signed by the lights in the palliative care area, Dr. Balfuhr Hamunt and Dr. Bernard Lyapuant and testifying to their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, the Québec health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to palliative care of high quality before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, "I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the ambulance department, in terrible pains, and no one has taken the necessary measures to alleen them.
I am afraid that patients want to die only because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day try to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
The hopes of survival of Helen Richard were already minimal when she stopped deer chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she regrets that I was stopping the fight," she says.
At the same time, she told me that my days were numbered!
There is no rap and rapist care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask for death thank the medical staff, for failing to fulfill their request, after the palliative care team eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the fight against pain.
According to Elsi Monroe, director of palliative care at the Grand Montreal House Palliative Care Society, patients are not susceptible to anesthesia in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps to the moment of his death, either from time to time or constantly.
One cannot pretend more that we do not know about these sufferings.
Increasingly, patients who are unable to relieve pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want me to have euthanasia," which means "I want me to make it easier for me."
The creation of this reportage was made possible thanks to a journalistic grant from the Institute for Research of Health of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for road construction, construction contractors, fundraisal workers of political parties and specialists in the Italian mafia day after day tell what they know about the colossal "system," entangles in the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unions and mafia.
"Industry," which cost taxpayers Québec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It is curious how this system crumbles after all the means were put into business, jokes Jacques Dusheno, deputy and former chief of the police of Montreal."
It was thanks to him that in 2011 a scandal broke out as a by-the result of the investigation of the crime related to road construction contracts in Quebec, for which the Prime Minister of the time from the liberals, Jean Shara, agreed very reluctantly.
The Dyusheno report has established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"Sin the investigation in 2010, he stresses, only one Ministry of Transport would keep a billion dollars on contracts," if some restrained their instincts to take a share.
The Charbonno Commission "has displaced two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will be able to "open the schemes behind individual personalities."
Permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The case was joined by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Division established in 2011, which included an extensive staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the staff of the special unit "Molot," which after 2009 forced the "slear cartel" of Montreal, to stop overestimating the cost of contracts.
Over the past weeks, a series of searches have been made, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zamino and Richard Markott, the mayor of a small town, were charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn - Gilles Vayyankur, who recently resigned from the post of mayor of Laval, the third largest city of the province of Quebec.
He is suspected of multiple bribes when placing state orders.
In addition, the official charge was brought to several engineers of the transport road service of Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akkusto and Lino Zambito.
The latter exploded a real bomb, telling the investigation of the "system" of obtaining state contracts.
For several years, Zambee has given 3% of the cost of contracts concluded in Montreal, a mediator associated with mafia, who, in turn, transferred the money of the party of Mayor Gerald Trump "United Montreal."
In the 2000s, Zambevo broke the money to the right and to the left. He transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties of the province, mainly liberals, who were in power then.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally collected funds for former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party Natali Normando.
Sewerage contracts in which the cost was overpriced
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked without a trouble and sack.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the Commission: for ten years he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes for a total of $ 736,000 in exchange for sewage contracts, the cost of which he overpriced.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads admitted that they received on their paws, oversaw the accounts by 30-40% with the help of fake additions.
Then, one organizer of the mayor's party, Marten Dumont, accused Mr. Trump of deliberately closing his eyes to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party cashier with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Trump resigned in early November, immersing Montreal in a deep crisis.
Chantal Roulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to be alarmed.
The mayor of the district of Riviere de PRair in the east of the island, it has been opposed to the sale of a municipal plot purchased for $ 5 million and resold for... 1.6 million developers in the midst of the construction boom.
70% of dirty money in electoral campaigns
She says that in an investigation that will eventually be started, it "will pull the thread, allowing to understand the functioning of the system indignants to stop the gangrene and determine the guilty."
This process is characterized as "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of dubious practices.
How we get away at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Dusheno notes that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is especially concerned about the role of "election officials who knew about this scheme," but did not participate in the machinations.
Given that the share of dirty money in financing the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Québec government proposes to limit the donations to the parties up to $ 100, but, according to him, this will not change the situation: "Until we strictly limit the election costs, there will be dirty money in politics."
It requires a complete reorganic system for granting state contracts and financing parties: "We cannot fall below; boldly understanding the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legality."
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dusheno encourages those who laugh, look into their own yard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you in the PSG achieved an extraordinary scale.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be a new dimension of the PSG.
Great players arrived.
Next to them I am growing every day.
Technical staff has also brought a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game daily.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not dispersed.
From the very beginning at the center of preliminary preparation at the NIF in Clerfonten and until my arrival in St. Etien, I always walked forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
To replenish this summer is not a novelty to play matches of a very high level.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me, wants to be at the level and put out to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti supports my positioning.
He is helped by such deputies as Claude McCalele, who played in the same position as me.
Anchelotti - the master of the situation?
Of course.
Anchelotti inspires respect to all technical staff.
Today in the First League he is not equal and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience and he won a lot of titles with top-notch clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I left a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the First League, Lyon took the place of leader from us.
But we are still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified effectively in one-eighth finals.
What is the goal of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, everything can be.
We will be able to say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to be able to take the return match in one-eighth final.
Will PSG be able to become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and strengthen its position for the long term.
Today it is not so.
Financially, PSG has the means to make this project real.
Do not take the title in the First League, as last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we really warmly wish to get this championship title.
Last season we were close to this.
In May, there was a disappointment, because we had everything to come to the finish line first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points involves the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think, everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that strong teams such as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have joined the competition for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
This is normal, what much is expected from us, given how much has been invested and what players we have.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troy and we still find something to criticize, of course, it is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what people expect from us first.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement the project of the game.
The team is formed over time.
We have proved in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who has not been able to pass in one eighth finals for two seasons, although they also spent a lot of money!
Given the invested amounts, we represented you by 15 points ahead already by the winter break.
It would be a disregard for our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, were "discited" by this new PSG.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that despite all the difficulties, as a result we won.
The PSG seems to depend entirely on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's feats.
Well, if they say that there is some "Zlatano addiction."
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores many goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is the star of the First League.
Wherever he played, he showed that he is a great player and a world-class star.
In the group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This stimulates others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive the Euro 2012 with the French team?
As a frustration.
I strongly wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from snatching a little game time.
I saw many things there, and I came out stronger.
Today I manage to play good qualifying matches .
This is what I have been hoping for since my baptism with the Sinykh.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must behave exemplaryly.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deschama at the head of the Blues?
They are effective for him.
He has good positions in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
He is a strict coach, he is close to the players and inspires to win.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I wouldn't like to compare.
Blanc has achieved his goal, he qualified us in the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will bring Blues to Brazil.
A good well-deserved draw (1-1), torn out on October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for all.
Before that shock in Spain, in my career there were no such matches.
Pay and Sell Without Banks Help - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, numbered transactions between receiving parties with commission fees for their processing.
In addition, as often happens to these technologies, a political vision is obvious: the belief that the current currency system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudoonym), is at the same time a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros ...) and a secure BitTorrent type exchange protocol, which allows you to exchange files between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers online.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins to make donations or as a payment instrument.
The bitcoin exchange rate, reaching a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell five months later to $ 2 before returning today to about ten dollars (courses listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special in comparison with the world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, was interested in this system.
He describes Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "alcosit on ordinary currencies."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, as "credits" used to promote in video games that are earned during the game or which can be bought (and sometimes exchange).
Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But the exchange operations always control and process any central authority.
In Bitkoin, all network nodes are simultaneously holders of the book, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually occurs between two email addresses, like an email.
Only for each new payment the user can choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically, using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to check that the bitcoins used in the deal do exist in the public account book sent across the network.
The key stage is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
It goes through the solution of the mathematical problem sent to computers, which, as if a temporary central bank, gets the privilege to add this new line.
We are talking about the phase of hashes the file, that is, the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it, before "shing" all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (a few zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily check that it is correct.
The transaction thus turns out to be an unraoredly connected with the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If for the purpose of cheating the user very quickly (less than ten minutes) would like to pay twice the same topic and the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem receives 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the reward is regularly divided in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one stomillion, which leaves the reserve...
The difficulty of the task also increases with the increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Sites that provide Bitcoin services were attacked, and bitcoins were stolen from reserves.
"The defect used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paymium - a company making payments with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this drawback.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizman Institute in Israel analyzed the counting book and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
"Giant sales" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," Joe Holmkwist, who works in Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold, rejoices.
Pierre Nuaz, another author of the manual on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via mobile phone, but it uses bitcoin to check transactions that is thus cheaper.
The owner controls his personal data better and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough to only inform the address that you can "photograph and recognize" the phone, specifies Pierre Noise, assing that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend of revising hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal.
"Before Bitcoin will be approved, it will take some time, but 2013 may become a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB in its report assumes, by the way, to reconsider various risks, which are considered today increased, in case of the success of this system.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapus and Suroby).
NATO and Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
For the Afghan army it is time to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not hoping only for us.
Most of the Afghan peasants, whom we considered as terrorists, suffered from us.
And we ourselves, with 88 dead soldiers, and wounded and hardened.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was in the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are tolerated, sometimes local rebels help them, but they will no longer behave as soon as the West becomes more delicate.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the height of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to the French credits, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul, without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, the invasion of the Talibs to Kabul will not be.
Circumstances have changed since their insurmountable advancement from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between various groups.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghan women paid for the darkness of these peasants, in which they surpassed Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved nowadays.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Talibs are united in their desire to hold women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become dealers, exciting state lands to resell them for the construction of repatriates who returned from Iran and Pakistan, using huge American subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the countryside, want a government that would not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have managed to American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; in Kabul now there are 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
State schools in cities are filled with boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, love mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world, and who watch everywhere.
At the moment, there is an army.
The authorities that will command her will be considered legitimate?
The old commanders, who led the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures to restore provincial guards that would not obey the central authorities.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country, with strong local differences, should be to a certain extent decentralized, according to the model of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, starting from the 50s, and even earlier, depends on foreign assistance.
The industry was not put on its feet, no dams functioned, no irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
The priority is given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by the thirty years of war, state control over infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
It only strengthened the feeling that Western countries were present there only to seize them.
Without energy for processing iron or copper or copper on site, without transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no extraction of minerals.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine Mes Ainak, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to excave a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers of the province.
It is also necessary that one day Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which import and export depend to a large extent, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat units ended on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement envisages the preservation of traditional assistance: lyceum for girls, boys, French faculty at the University, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "conquest hearts and minds" and perform an impossible task of combining assistance with offensive operations, the service of "military and civil activity" under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with the intense involvement of local labor, were able to help to restrain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest recovery, fruit trees, soil protection and increased area of arabtoil land.
What will we leave for ourselves by spending two billion euros on military expenditures?
Much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural works coming from local communities in the province of Capis.
In order to get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, what farmers wish, as they have told me, it is necessary to provide them with small non-military support, which would be well controlled and treated directly.
Heavy births of the Constitution of Egypt
This is a new risky step of President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of a constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him extraordinary powers, he decided to play all-in.
Having made everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote according to the final text the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the Head of State gave the Assembly two additional months to finish the work.
Soon for two years, as Egypt relies on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium," continuing to "break the word" and "to trample the right."
In the camp of his followers, they are sure that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
Referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time, which makes the Brothers give up the intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, the article behind the article.
For the president, this is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, the call for an accelerated vote is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Or you vote for my text, or I leave extraordinary powers," which is supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, for the most part, Islamists voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to convey their opinion.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities, or civil society have done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, spare participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, amused the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around... time for prayer, as some members of the committee believed that the hours of the Constituent Assembly were incorrect.
The text, according to which the voting was held yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, Article 2 eventually remained identical to an article from the Constitution of 1971, which states that "the Princess of Sharia is the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace the "principles" with the "rules" which would enable them to be more strict.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is evidence of their goodwill and respect for other members of the Egyptian society.
"Percenoe," respond liberals, who see it only PR.
In their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They point out especially to Article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular, in terms of checking the compliance of the laws of Shariatu.
According to the expert on Egypt Sophie Pumier, this is alarming, because "people designed to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can observe the origin of theocracy."
Many liberals, in addition, are agitated by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be much less moderate than the present one.
"At the moment there is no concrete religious intervention.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most lawyers who worked on this text are not sludge, but people with university education, some were trained in the French system," - calms Alexis Bloy, who prepares a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "around article 220 may arise ambiguous, since the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to the "fixes" [islamic jurisprudence, - Ed.].
And in the future, there may be a question of how competent civil judges are to make decisions about it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized, as it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have significantly decreased in comparison to what they were in the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
According to the military's wishes, the defense budget will be considered not in the Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
Also, the court of civilians in military courts will not be banned, despite the requests of associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they consider destructive for freedom.
The responsibility for blasphemy has been preserved, and from now on it is prohibited to insult, which may have serious consequences for freedom of speech, especially for press freedom.
In addition, none of the articles speaks of the protection of a woman, stresses Heb Moraef, from Human Wrights.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, the manifestations are scheduled today in the afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will go to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, Pup Earth and the sea of brine
The Promtoden Earth combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and pristineness of nature.
"AiF" has identified five of the most important reasons for which you need to visit Israel.
Let us bow to the holy places
It is necessary to visit the Jordan, in which Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that God's grace descends on all those who enter this "coup."
And Galileo is the place of the wonders of Jesus: the transformation of the water into wine, the water, the calming of the storm, and the filling of the nets.
Jesus appeared here before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of all is the sanctuary in Jerusalem.
The believers here pass the Path of Sorb, or the Way of Jesus" Cross Road (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Anthony - Pretorium - where there was a court, and through the streets of the Old City leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the Cunning, the Stone of Anointing and the place of burial of Jesus.
Here is also a symbolic Christian Pup of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is erected on the place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew, from which made a cross to the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem, there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wailing Wall, which remained of the temple destroyed by the Romans in the 70s of A.D.
By tradition, people of different confessions leave here notes with desires, which are then fulfilled.
To travel vertically
The ruins of the fortress of Massad remained from the secret shelter from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on the steep cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above the ocean level.
And to get to them with their own move can only those who are fond of mountaineering.
The rest to this historic top delivers the lift on the cable car.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
To it from the foot of the mountain delivers a shuttle bus.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly lived pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
For one trip in all you do not visit.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, to visit.
Among them - the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It is also worth to visit the Museum of Arts in Tel Aviv.
His exposition features the paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum-bath of Al Basa, which is a few halls of ancient Turkish baths with fake visitors and banishers of the time.
In Caesarea, you should go to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no guides and souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are not accepted categorically.
The fifth - the Holocaust or Yad-Vash Museum in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - a children's memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it - and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are simmering.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Health
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea bathe even in the winter months, because the water temperature there does not fall below 21 degrees of heat, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is still warmer, and there bathe all year round.
By the way, this is the most extraordinary sea in the world is at the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below the ocean level.
Cote dAzur water in it - brine, easy to keep afloat even not able to swim at all.
The seats around unrealistically beautiful.
They go here to undergo a course of treatment with the use of salt water - rapa, and healing mud, and to cure health in dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus to bring in order the shaking nerves.
Touch the secrets of antiquity
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it went the famous Seaway, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatoly and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to the precedent, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Persia saved the beauty of Andromeda, with which they lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander through the narrow streets, named in honor of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street "his" sign, Fortune will become benevolent.
In Jaffa you can find newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries in a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea - the city of the king Herod - you can wander through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourist to note
Going to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population knows the Russian language.
Money on a trip is better not to take in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for ILS (now $ 1 - 3.8 ILS).
Urban transport - mostly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a high-speed tram, and in Haifa - the country's only metro line consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
Travel in all types of urban transport costs 6 ILS, for which you can ride with transfers for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Shabbat is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday stops markets, shops, public transport.
And on Sunday in the morning the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk is combined with meat.
There offer a large selection of dishes of lamb and beef, soups and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish pasta hummus, various sauces, balls of ground chick - Dildo, fruits and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs in the streets of Israel.
But a lot of fattened cats, which are great "walk by themselves."
In the evening they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Murlyki love crowded places and do not give up on the dishes.
Rent a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $ 37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $ 15. per day.
And the bike rental will cost 15 ILS. a day.
Tickets to museums are on average 30 ILS.
Language of numbers
In 2012, Israel was visited by more than three million tourists from all over the world.
Most travel and rest came citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
On the Earth Promise from January to October 2012 visited 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the abolition of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Great and mighty" to Moscow will bring: migrants save money into language
While MPs and human rights defenders argue that they will give the law on compulsory language testing, fraudsters have already appeared in the country, trading "lip" certificates
Every year 13 million gastarbeiters come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left in their homeland.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every migrant will be obliged to pass an exam on the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the field of service, housing and communal services, everyday life and retail trade.
However, over time, - they promise in the FMS - the tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
Moreover, we will have to give not only the language, but also the Russian history, and the basics of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both for obtaining and for the extension of the work permit.
The exception is valid only for citizens of those countries where Russian is the state language.
The law is not subject to the law and people who have managed to get certificates and diplomas on education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Use, doom and protection of rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, People's Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of testing was supported by deputies of the State Duma and the FMS.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, have managed to ask the press many times the question: what will it give?
What will change the obligatory knowledge of the language for Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, - answer representatives of the migration service - this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery."
Many people speak now about the protection of the rights of labor migrants, explains the head of the representative office of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights should begin before their departure.
Only the system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems appear in migrants without profession, education that do not know the language, do not have medical examination.
Without understanding the language, - said Sebelev, - the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who under the guise of help will put him a "travel" in a terrible tight barrack, where he and dozens of such will languate for months without food and documents, piling 12-14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"At home they are promised one, and on arrival they are deceived, selected passports, do not pay the promised salary," - confirms the head of the Main Department of labor migration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Don't scold, nasalnik!
Nevertheless, so far, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who are going to work in Russia admit that they do not only do not know the language of the country in which they seek, but also write with difficulty on their own.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, as the trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even a sensible primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to even feed children, not to mention how decently to wear them, to shoes and to equip them to school.
As they grow to adolescence, such guys at the first opportunity are sent to work.
It is difficult, if it is bad with knowledge of the language, they confess.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
However, human rights activists note one important point in relation to the law on language.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status - there will be neither exam nor subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the gastarbeiters still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or stranger's entrance is prohibited"
Many of the visitors say that getting an official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason - in bureaucratic obstacles and all the same linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But the fake registration can be done quickly and just one and a half thousand.
The Russian police know that we mostly have false documents, no registration, hence cases of extortion.
"A hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Umed Khushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, shared with journalists.
"Nalleti, not a cap, buy painting"
On the first day of the law on language entry into force it turned out that not only migrant documents on registration are false.
Several "lip" certificates on the passage of language tests have already been withdrawn by the FMS staff.
Forged papers are printed on a conventional color printer.
Of course, they got the new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, who hoped to facilitate themselves in this way the task of passing tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two times more expensive than the procedure of official testing: it will cost a migrant laborer three thousand.
The fact that the main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the "roots" can not be simply bought, both government officials and human rights defenders agree.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise gastarbeiters who failed to successfully pass the test from the first time, the time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
The share of crimes with the use of legal weapons is extremely small
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to tighten the law against civilian weapons owners.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: Press shots at weddings, when there were no casualties, and a massacre arranged by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which seven people were killed.
Policemen want to ban the wearing of traumatism in public places and increase the age from which you can get a license for weapons - from 18 years to 21 years.
Irina Yarovaya, head of the Duma committee for security and anti-corruption, supported the idea and promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the nuts."
An open letter appeared in the network, the authors of which - representatives of various public small organizations - demand to give up "senseless tightening."
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said the Russian service of the BBC lawyer forensic Vasily Lesnikov.
According to statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in six months of 2012 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in the internal affairs bodies, while in the same period 1168 thousand crimes were committed.
The authors of the open letter believe that the tightening of legislation in the field of civil weapons does not place the criminal to go to the "black" market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry claims that they control the situation with the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
Black arms market is replenished with several channels.
The main such channels are five, says retired colonel Victor Baranets, who worked in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for ten years.
Screenshot of the site accepting weapons orders
The first is "military or military trail," that is, a weapon that was stolen during the hostilities in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were dragged by Russian officers, and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranets.
The next kind of "black weapon" is stolen by criminals from representatives of security agencies.
The Baranets explains that this includes the stolen from the police warehouses, and stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
Illegal "bables" go on sale from military warehouses.
Many military warehouses often had explosions.
"There are proven versions that part of the arson was made specifically - to hide the lack," the former military said.
According to Baranza, the manufacturers of weapons contribute their contribution.
"Now private weapons factories are breeding, which do not withstand competition in the international market and throw weapons from under the floors to the black market, including Moscow," - says the expert.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
Especially a lot of guns and automatic rifles from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its production, sometimes artisanal, and formed a mafia that organized a stream," explains the former military.
Where does the weapon come from?
Experts considered the approximate share of each of the sources of illegal arms supplies to the "black" market.
This report was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problematic Analysis and State-Management Design.
Experts analyzed the reporting of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data of portals on weapon issues.
The overwhelming part of illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and security agencies.
Half of the weapons on the black market were there "at the fault of officials whose work is associated with weapons," the report says.
According to researchers, 17% of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases there are thefts at the stage of arms production, 5% falls on "black archaeology."
The salesman-consultant of one of the weapons stores, who asked not to name his name, assures that the weapons found by black spears have long been buying - too old.
Most often, as he says, the new party sellers go to the military warehouse.
Through the warrant officer a person buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
He is subscribed, transmitted through the fence.
"He transports it to the city and here sells 900 euros per piece with two shops," he says.
"True, the police are aware of all cases, so periodically when the plan for the disclosure of crimes is burning, conducts control purchase from traders illegal weapons," the consultant adds.
"As in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through friends.
I looked at the sites, blogs, until the comrade responded, who proposed to come to the platform "God," where there will be a person who will take me to the "corner" where we will bargain.
The price of the trunk I found out only there
military observer Victor Baranets
To get the barrel I need a friend who has a way out, - says the seller-consultant. - I have such a friend, but I'm not sure.
There are sellers in the markets, but there is also a conditional one, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that his daughter's tooth had fallen."
Now I even get a couple of castes through a person who is sure.
He also delivers them only to me, because he knows that I will not give it.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when preparing for publication an article about it.
According to him, the plans have not changed.
He was given an album with photos, where there was "everything."
"I felt like in a luxurious store," the military recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranza, do not offer a cat in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, not just buy - we go with the seller to the forest, there put a target.
"I am given the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that the weapon beats well, we begin to bargain," the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the couch
Search engines on the Internet bring to sites and groups in "Vkontakte," where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
This does not require any documents and personal meetings.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," - write in the advertising cap on the site "Buy a combat gun or automatic."
It users leave their applications and ask questions.
And will they sell to minors?
"Without a license of course," asks the user "Ivan" (subscriptography is preserved).
"Kupi TT.Moscow" - laconicly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has now dispersed a huge network of fade sites and those wishing to buy combat weapons rowing with a shovel.
People go like a hungry fish to bait, and then mined coal in Siberia
military observer and former military Victor Baranets
I heard about such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the Russian laws.
People accept orders.
The buyer through the ATM makes payment.
"In response, they send a photo and instructions, where weapons are hidden," - says Dmitry Kislov, press secretary of the public organization "Right to arms."
Victor Baranets claims that leaving the application on the site, you can stay without arms and get behind the bars.
The Federal Security Service has now dispersed a huge network of fade sites and those wishing to buy combat weapons rowing with a shovel.
"People go like a hungry fish to bait, and then get coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $ 100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, you can settle in the amount of 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the organization "Right to arms," Makarov's gun can be purchased for $ 100-300.
Waiting for a month and a half.
It is shipt from warehouses of long-term storage management of these warehouses of the middle level.
According to the official stattion of the department, compared with January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of revealed facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, there are fast food workers and supermarkets
Through work at McDonald's box office up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, a wave of protests against low salaries in the department stores of Walmart corporation and restaurants of popular fast food networks, such as McDonalds, Burger King, Taso Belle, Wendis and Kentucky Freid chienen .
Until no one dares to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth rampart or it is destined to breathe out in the early stages.
The actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising modest wages that ordinary Walmart workers and fast food systems, the purpose of protest organizers is to create trade union organizations.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The shares began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "Black Friday," when America hit the orgie of cheap sales, which captured millions of citizens and sometimes accompanied by brawl.
On this day, some employees of the Walmart corporation, in which 2.2 million people work around the world, left their jobs and picketed together with the trade unions and left-wing activists of the corporation's stores, whose goods are calculated for people of modest and average wealth.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores on average from 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart workers are only at work.
The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the product cheaper partly because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example, the lack of forklifts or manual scanners.
The participants of the shares in "Black Friday" demanded to raise their salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $ 30 to $ 100 per month.
A typical Walmart employee who receives $ 9.5 per hour, this expense is not affordable, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost corporations $ 3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than she spends on salaries now.
If Walmart completely shifts the wage growth on the shoulders of buyers, then each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more expensive.
Over the year they will spend on some 12.39 dollars more than now.
Walmart's supporters quite note that protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any damage to corporations.
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 pm on Thursday to midnight next day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 goods per second.
In total, its cash registers produced almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The representative of the corporation Dan Fangelman claimed in an interview to the left-wing site Huffington Post that the jobs left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was only "an alternate PR trick" of the trade union that organized it.
"Free cashier!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their object was not Walmart (they do not complain about them in this progressive city, and so they are not here yet), and "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you hospitals and doesn't pay you for honest work!
Jumain Williams, member of the City Council of New York
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York legislation, is $ 7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants over time increase, but not a little, and on average their ordinary workers receive in New York $ 8.90 per hour.
Less of them in this expensive city is not earned by anyone.
How it is possible to exist in New York for such money, it is incomprehensible to me.
Once through McDonald's was almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked behind their counters after school, while living with their parents.
Few people saw in this the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I constantly get to the interview with the employees of McDonald's, who complain that they should live on this salary and sometimes even feed children on it.
On the other hand, the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal hangs a comment, the author of which remarks that it is irresponsible to bring children if you do not know what you will feed them.
The protesters, which began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and chefs of the fast food system start paying at least $15 per hour, that is, more than doubled their current minimum earnings.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the field of fast food.
The American law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing the trade union movement activists with scriings and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is difficult to cover fast food by the trade union for objective reasons.
One of the main - extraordinary fluidity of personnel.
Dissenting
Noisy protests took place on this day and at a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was in the middle of the day meeting at McDonald's meeting next to Times Square, where several local democrat politicians spoke, in particular, a member of the City Council Jumain Williams, who said: "McDonald's" says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he does not even give you hospitals and does not pay you for honest work!"
Other prominent New York democrats, for example, Bill De Blasio, supported the demonstrators, who said that "we must jointly join in support of fast food workers in order to achieve fair payment and economic prosperity, which everyone New Yorkers deserves!"
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food sector.
But it was attended by only a few hundred people, and not all of them were fast food workers, in which tens of thousands of people are employed in New York.
It is still unclear whether this spark will generate a flame of mass motion.
"While to cheat the brain turns out to be medium"
Popular among fans of modern technologies, the topic of augmented reality has recently been accepted mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First in the summer at its annual conference, the current model showed Google, and then in November it became known that the application for the appropriate patent was submitted by Microsoft.
However, from a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D-technologies in the Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Sharam Isadi follows that for scientists of this company glasses - the passed stage.
They are beckoned by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, please, what is your research team doing?
- We are engaged in human interaction with machines, but at the same time we try to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity is stuck in the mass at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes the stagings in them with a finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and predict radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox set-top box and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is not sold, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
"What's yet ahead of us?"
- Despite the fact that Kinect has shifted interaction to the physical level, much is still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the conclusion is not very.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
It is necessary to release the computer world in our physical, to make it more sedible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
A popular thing, but do not overestimate it?
- It is definitely not a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because you do not always want to notify others about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but everyone in his own niche.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not over the swinging, but over such stingy, short.
At the same time, gestures were not filmed by a camera device, but with a wristband that fixed the movements of bones and muscles.
While it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the wristwatch.
But in general, the future is behind a mixed type of management, for example, gesture+oloss.
"What about it?"
- For example, how will you ask me to give you this soda bank?
You will say and show at the same time.
"I usually just say.
- Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
- That is, you want to make users adapt to what can or can't the car at the moment?
- It is not necessary, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will mainly have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow to determine more accurate human reactions.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Not enough permission, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be pushed away in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 k / s.
But it is not in the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds the work of algorithm designers.
That is, we must remember not only about the permission on axieths X and Y, but also Z.
Speed, the number of frames per second is also very important.
Man's movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s frankly scarcely, especially for gestures.
Steven Betis from our Radmonds laboratory made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100ms, and modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of man and machines.
In my work, I would be very useful in the equivalent of such a device, but not requiring touches, so that the frames per second were more.
- And the number of cameras do not need to increase?
- In Kinect now there are three "cameras," one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the second is the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is, in fact, the usual sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or aggravate it by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how it will help in three-dimensional definition of the position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present her glasses to the public.
You don't think that from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technology glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time to walk, holding a smartphone in raised hands, not very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be a "transition" augmented reality, when on the basis of a cloud platform you could switch from glasses to smartphone, projection display and further everywhere.
Points - a very personal device, in this force (wrand things you see only you), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the "Iron Man," but also to a simple mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to such an idea: there is no tactile review!
Hands feel nothing!
What answers do your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine.
I think the eighth may well be an addition to tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks - the use of the second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
It registers the clicks perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at giving these "pictures in the air" of abrasiveness - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located, gives a feeling, but while it is very weak - as if you were fed to the pillows.
There are bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
"And you tried to deceive the brain?"
To make him think that he feels what seems to have to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried to do that yet.
Here lies another task, which will be fought for a long time - how to make a person physically in a very limited space, to believe that he goes on an open, almost infinite - we work on the concepts of treadmills (not such as in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
While deceiving the brain turns out to be medium, the work is still very for many years.
That's what makes the work on the virtual reality of such an attractive for the researcher - many things in an absolutely emmigry state.
Tasteman instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "St. Petersburg Avant-Garde," dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art.
This top list has already included bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing the all-Russian fame.
The new hero of Rosbalt is an empathetic artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man, dressed in all red, which is found at the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, then on fashion parties and vernissage.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather crowds of spectators, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosophical storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, his appearance on the streets causing a smile at the citizens, raising everyone's mood.
Recently he took the charm and became a charman in St. Petersburg, as he matured for this complex role all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
"Cyril, and why do you go through the city in all red, not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a fashion designer dealing with the view and image.
In this world, the red color is a compromise between the artist, imagemaker and society.
Although in society everything that is slightly not gray, causes aggression and excitement of uncoming a poor property.
But my provocations are aimed at starting the conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
"And when did you realize that you should be an artist?"
- At the exhibition in the DK Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that it was my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and new, free types of me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gasnevshchina, which led to the "Pushkin-10," and there was no more wave.
I am thrown into theater, clothes, music, in all genres except words.
"And all this has come together in your Art-clinic..." It was important for me to be in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995 I occupied the territory on Pushkin-10, and there, until there was a refurbishment, there was a musical and art club, a bohemian club, a house of St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: NOM, Tekikala-jaz, I remember Schnur's brought with the project "Wang Gogh's Wrong's Wrong."
The stinur and his friends sang light songs under plywood, they were in a tight tight lee, among them was the fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group played alive, she became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was the leading many programs before the Khali-galian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and went his great career, and he got basic education and education with us.
Gallery "D 137," club "Griboedov - is echoes from the Art-Clinic.
Our employees and regulars have gone there.
I am the hero of yesterday's age, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the award was "People of our city."
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" was named me, my culmination ended.
In the new times, according to the old rules, it is uncomfortable to work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are shared, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
"Your works have a recognizable manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a pronounced relevance and acuteness.
I will have a program exhibition, "Russian Museum in clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now to be like that - it hurts and scary.
But in clowns everything is smeared, tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world by means of totalitarian changing in order.
Now on clothes meet, focusing on the external mechanics, and not on the inner man.
And maybe he can't give his hand and he should spit in the grove.
And the deception will be removed with the help of changing.
"And recently we saw you as a city charmer." - Cultural city should have such a hero.
To whom, as not to me, they should be.
"Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?"
- Now commercial art must be neat, tactical, sweet.
Disintegration of cultures is in the.
Previously, people were beaten in a flock, one loved the bohemian, and the other was a different.
Now everyone is broken in the microcommunity, now it is difficult to like everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar paper to please everyone.
Now you need to think who will like.
Now each cult hero has 100 fans.
"And Stas Mikhailov comes to several thousand!"
- throwings come on it, there the sex-social sphere works.
And on the cultural soil 300 people will come, and 10 thousand will not come, and as a result less management, money, everything sneer.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, do not spoil the gained.
I wrote such pictures in my youth that one collector had a collector on the wall next to Falck and Larionov hung.
I started with paintings that usually end.
Now often confuse concepts.
They say: culture spiritual, culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a man of culture yesterday, grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for drawing paintings.
I'm for such a culture.
- Kirill, what is missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: an official from culture.
But not each of them can engage in culture.
With the right kings everything was not so, the kings, maybe not very understood in the culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
Here in Moscow now good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are pushed, as we need higher experts who will correctly appreciate these experts and give them the way.
Now the taster thrives.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is for you - St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil there.
And on our stones art is difficult to grow.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than readers, it's wrong.
Here in Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of thin.
We need to make fashion art, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented at the expense of the St. Petersburg grant
Born in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with an asteroid killer.
Caravanas of spaceships with earthlings on board go in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question arises, how to continue your gender in weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Surdin, senior researcher at the State Astronomical Institute named after P.K.Sternberg (GAIS).
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - a temperature of 500 degrees.
You can live only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
To approach the issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments on plants were conducted.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then - the removal of insects in the orbit, tiny fruit flies-dropophile.
In 1979, the quail eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops in weightless conditions.
We get at the output of an absolutely normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
Vladimir Sychev, Head of the Laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMB) of the Russian Academy of Sciences, explains: "The problem related to the fact that this chick should find a support, he must stand on his feet and start moving."
Without finding support, the chicks skuling disorderly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to the light and sound.
And there the trouble was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we hated the chicks, then refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev, the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
With animals, the last time biological "mynik" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" will be only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already with fruit.
In principle, there were no supernatural.
"It was on biosatellite, but again it is a single experiment, and such research should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the cosmic rats had offspring.
But it is not yet possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the cosmos.
A difficult task.
Animals, losing their habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkova had the biggest risk.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could say whether it will survive after the flight into space.
Will she be to give birth to a child after this flight.
"No one answered this question," Vakhtang Vachnadze, veteran of the space-missile industry, says.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andriyan Nikolaev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice visited orbit and even worked in open space, was born a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, there are units of astronauts, which after long flights all cost, and grows a healthy generation.
"And if more, it is dangerous even during orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Yet, it is necessary for humanity to seek some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratory of the Central Complex - a mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here, under zero buoyancy, astronauts practice working out their skills in open space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for adults water, albeit comfortable, but still foreign environment, then for infants - native element.
Little ichtjands seem to confirm - life on land has gone out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months in the sedive liquid, it is easier to get used to the vodka.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bathing, takes only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, an instructor of nursing.
In short, if for a born child weightlessness is more natural condition, then for a woman - a gravity, a force of gravity is necessary.
Very quickly in weightlessness the abdominal muscles, pelvis, the ability to push the fetus falls.
Well, okay, let's oop, and this, relying on stimulants of generic activity.
You can, of course, in a special chamber to go to childbirth, it will push him out.
Valery Polyakov asks non-trivial questions, "And then what's next?"
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling terrestrial attraction, the body will not form a skeleton and muscle system.
The newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to wear a special load suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what he will be vitally needed.
"And this experiment, which we will go to, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled person, a completely de-adapted person," - says Igor Pestov, head of the Committee on Bioethics of IMBP of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
While the birth of children in space is a question of theory.
However, after a time it will be a reality when earthlings on their ships will go to a distant planet that will become home to their descendants born in space.
Head of the Main Auditing Department: The inspection of the mooring system failed due to the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement industry Czech Republic has good controls and, despite the presence of quality legislation, lags behind its application.
This statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice President of the High Audit and Audit Authority, from an interview for the site Aktueln.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it should be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have enough,"- commented on the current situation Kala.
Such conclusions are provided by a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of incorrect practice lead Peter Nechas' approach to the so-called mooring system.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with inspections - is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law should be established in any way, and if he prohibits something, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of institutions that are obliged to check and enforce obligations,"- says Kala.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, within the framework of which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What exactly was the matter?
It refers to a parallel test, which we started, probably two years ago.
Simply put, the question is that the European legislation states how the state procurement should be carried out, the national legislation should be followed and then also applied in practice.
All the information was collected and, even with an unfinished inspection, found interesting differences - simply put, the legislation can be "actful and unmistakable," but in the practice of application we are inferior to Germany in some parameters.
From this it follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
And how can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
Such joint control can contribute to efforts to stop clarification of laws, reduction and improvement of restrictions, because this does not lead to a positive result.
Economy means getting the appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it is not a fact that we will achieve this by lowering the limitation of orders.
Perhaps this system will be filled with " papers" so that those who want to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the limitation did not decrease.
You are talking about the internal problems of practical application of the legislation on public procurement.
And how does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization like our CRU (Contro-Aruisal Management) or does it work differently?
As for institutions, there is also a board of our CRU Bundesrechnungshof, arranged on our principle, there is also a collegium that works a little differently, but mainly both institutions function similarly.
In addition, the powers are similar to a certain extent, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and federal states - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can manage only federal money, we have state funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounts chambers.
As for local legislation, it is easier than we have?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a sample, but it is definitely impossible to say that it is better in everything.
Is that because they better cope with the control?
Definitely not, but I repeat, I do not like such comparisons.
But I must say that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, would they not get any advantage of cooperation with our office, right?
If we talk about domestic law, how did the amendments to the Law on Public Procurement affect your institution, somehow the consequences are manifested?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet manifested itself in our control works.
Since we control the fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future inspections - we started using our new tool "to find the risk of non-economy," through which we have chased out almost 14,000 government contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will manifest, because the restrictions are changing, the conditions of some types of tenders and so on are changing.
Do you think the approval of this law will benefit or additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be "hardened" and cannot be observed.
When previous rules operate, controlled enterprises are bound by a supplier (for example, regional operational programs - with the regional council) that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of the budget discipline.
Is it worth tightening the law in this way?
I don't think it's this way.
The system must exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create even more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP will not bother entrepreneurs with checks of the so-called mooring system.
"Swarz-system" is prohibited or allowed?
The law should be established in any way, and if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the bodies charged with checking and seeking the fulfillment of obligations.
We can say, "We will change this law and allow it," but we cannot say that we will pretend that nothing happens.
The law on public procurement contains quite strict rules, how and what should be formally carried out, and this is correct.
But, on the other hand, this is tragic when a candidate with the best proposal is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we are lacking.
The roads are sometimes slippery, but mostly passable.
In some places in the Czech Republic roads frozen and snowy.
They are mostly passable, but in some places they are more cautious.
Karlovy Vary
This morning in the Karlovore region roads were crossed, but in some places frozen and snowy.
The temperature fell from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day should gradually warm.
Snowfall in the region ceased, only in the lowlands lies a small layer.
However, on the ridges of the Ore Mountains lies about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information received from the regional road workers, it became known that sometimes there was a lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 high-speed highway and the first-class roads in the region are currently passed without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
Also, all roads related to the second and third class, including mountain trails, passable.
But in some of their areas still lie the remains of frozen and sometimes traveled snow.
Especially careful need to be on the roads located on the highlands.
Pardubitsky and Kralovegradsky krai
The traffic control of the Czech Republic and highways on its web pages informs that some roads in the eastern Czech Republic are threatened with ice, and on the mountain roads and roads located on the hills, there may be a snow layer.
Regional road workers warn drivers of ice, which can be formed especially on the hills of Pardubitsky region.
The golode can be near Lashkroun, Ustin nad Orlici, Polichka, Svitawi or Wisoke-Mito especially on the roads of the second and third class.
The roads I/43 and I/34 located in Svitavia are treated with chemicals.
Especially the snow lies on the roads of Krconnoche and Orlyk Mountains.
The roadway is on the roads located on the hills in the areas of Rihnova nad-Knezhnou and Trutnova.
In the Eastern Czech Republic today is a variable cloudiness without rainfall.
The temperature usually varies between minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Plzen region this morning are crossed, but in some places you need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning frosty, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places can be slippery.
In places drivers can face fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
Information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 Highway is now passing almost without restrictions, however, road managers recommend to be cautious between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the roads of the first class have a dry and frozen surface.
In the southern Pilzni and Takhova can come across frozen areas.
The roads of the second and third grade are wet, and in this case there is a warning due to the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on low-used roads in the area of Shuva.
Olovoutsky Krai
Drivers heading on the hill of Olomowsk region, today should take into account the snow porridge on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervenogorsk saddle and on the road in the direction of Videel Krshizh.
At night, snowfall forced to go to the street of road workers, according to information from the road management, in Shumperka fell about three centimeters of snow.
In other areas of the road, as a rule, pass without restrictions.
"There are remnants of snow on the hills of Shumperka.
Drivers heading towards Essek should bear in mind the presence of snow porridge in the Chervenogorsk saddle,"- said today the CHAN (Czech News Agency) dispatcher of the noise management of roads.
At night, their colleagues from Essenik went to clear the roads, and they assured that the roads on the highlands after processing chemicals remained naked and wet.
In Olomouce road is passed without restrictions, but in Sternberka drivers should be careful on the forest areas where the humidity is still preserved.
Ustetsky krai, Liberetsky krai
This morning road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are a few difficult places left.
According to the information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snowfall, a mountain road is closed on the site from Telnica in the Clinic in the Ustyk region.
The temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so the roads retain snow and ice. In the lowland, especially to the south-east of the Czech Middlegorye, on the contrary, there is no problem, the roads are mostly dry.
The complications on the roads are not yet reported.
Road workers report on the appearance of ice in the vicinity of Stet.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for his formation at night - it rained all day and snow melted, at night the sky cleared and began frost.
Reported on unfavorable conditions on the main highway and on the highway I/13 on the border of Ustetsky and Liberetsky krai.
Because of the snow-curved branches of trees related to the road itself, were forced to close the road in the Telnica on the Knitsa.
Shimon Ornest: At the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month the end of the world should come?
This is just one of the many alarming news that we, people, are so easy to meet.
Together with The Tap Tap we are constantly joking on this topic and saying that we are the only group in the world that will be able to collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell readers in more detail about this?
We are talking about the national fundraising event, which we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that the Mayan calendar has, the end of which was announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, December 20th at 21:00 will start three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava in parallel.
They will end roughly, at the moment when on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than we have, the May calendar will end.
Who did this idea come to mind?
Initially it was my idea, then we all invented along with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate quite positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which the world we will once give to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, t-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be bought on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus provide us with support.
The Tap Tap group, together with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World is Revaged."
Will the YouTube listeners already have a favorite an anthem on these beneficent concerts sound?
Of course, at the very end, if in the end everything turns out and the end of the world will not come.
It will be seded by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
The gymnas will also sound live on the Czech television.
Words to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the video clip Tomas Ganak, also participates in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start cooperating with them?
We also cooperate with other persons of the Czech cultural life as we hold many charity events and concerts.
We try to actively connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?
For the sixth year we have been working with the Tap Civil Association at the Edlychka Institute for the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO.
Teachers regularly attend the schools of the Edlika Institute and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves have no means to go to the teachers, and we try to give them this opportunity.
As part of the project of additional construction of the Edlichka Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, in which we will move with this project.
Several musical groups and performers will perform at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to make a program that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiri Suhi.
All the details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such "grand" events in the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time at the festival "Priage Spring" and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would be happy to present at the Czech national home in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
As for you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road in terms of organization and logistics??
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their strollers should travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large amount of cargo and boxes with tools.
However, so far they have coped with this without problems. Czech airlines and British Airways British Airways have always been excellent for us, which has been amazing for us.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went without problems.
Thanks to travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitude to the disabled and so on.
What have you encountered by now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything is better than in our country, in Russia we have witnessed that the east is still at the base level.
In comparison with Prague in Moscow there are a lot of barriers, and here is still in the wild independent movement of a person on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also there are not in the course of such banal things as to give way to the disabled in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that try to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, should we constantly catch up with the leading countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of performance which is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people who are concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite normal that people with a heavy form of disability move on their own on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, and anywhere...
It is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we are a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
The public's respevelation or barrier-freeness is one thing, but at the moment when well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will appear among us, then everything will really begin to change.
While these are isolated cases - people with strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is now very popular, but we'll get back two years ago, which in 1998 made you organize it?
I entered the institute of Edlychka as an educator, there were many young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I myself am a musician and I play also on saxophone, together with my colleague I organized an interesting music club.
Well, over time, as our presenter Ladya Angelovic says, it is a little out of control (laughs).
Popularity came only in recent years, or do I confuse something?
It is true that we were helped by the fact that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on the band's propaganda.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can assess, in fact, as if there is no.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was the goal in front of you so well to promote The Tap Tap?
From the very beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
The Show business is full of things that imitates one other.
This is logical, all new is taken with caution, and it lasts for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, pity, is natural...
But this pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not some kind of suffering and all the abandoned personalities we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities do something, it is a shift not only for them, but also for the whole society.
Did you succeed that you are a strict leader, what do many consider you?
If we want to do the work qualitatively, we must be in many things uncompromising and keep a certain discipline.
But I think it's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they should go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But this is what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, the group of The Tap Tap twenty people.
How many of them were in the beginning of 1998?
Only one Ladya Angelovic.
We are an open group, people come and go away, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have desire and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place a day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno - at the club Fléda and Ostrava - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a teleconference at the time of the song of The Tap Tap "End of the World is canceled."
The purpose of this project is to raise funds in the amount of 25 million crowns for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational center at the Institute of Edlichka in Prague.
The ticket for the concert costs 400 CZK, for children under 12 years old free entry. Tickets can be bought in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ECA on September 12, 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with the ECA in 1994 and over the next years took an active part in a number of projects of the agency.
But the path to space Poland began a lot earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in flights to space, but it was not always met with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, about the lecture by A.Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933 represented in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his innovative work "Introduction to Cosmonautics."
The young engineer's ideology (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gademsky was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltri and Andre Luis Hirsche for the "Introduction to Cosmonautics."
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Hadomsky became a well-known world propagandist of cosmonautics, and his contribution was appreciated, including by the fact that one of the craters on the back of the Moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925, a railway rail was built in Poland, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not clear even, a rocket was to be used to disperse or to braking the trolley.
Information about this Dresine is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, Polish artillery began to think about missile arrows.
The study was carried out by the armament equipment section in cooperation with professors Mechislaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokzhitsky.
From the surviving materials it is clear that the studies have reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of the German troops the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photoelectric fighter missile proposed by engineer Rogozinski appeared in a specialized press, and next year the work of the "Air torpedo missile and aircraft bomb" by the author of Leliva-Kizoblotsky was launched.
Both projects were designed for the military use of rocket engines.
Before the war all projects of military use of rocket equipment was carried out by the Temporary Scientific and Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated the whole work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its work, the work ended due to the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronzystwo Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954, the magazine "Problems," which publishes four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that will deal with astronautics.
At that time, projects of artificial satellites were gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research is a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics Society (POA) has tried to join the international astronautics federation (founded in 1951), and already in the autumn of the PIA became its valid member.
And next year, the first chairman of the PA Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became the deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
In this position he remained until his death, which came in 1959.
Since 1956, the PIA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological missile RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile to perform scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile, capable of overcoming a distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, two-stage RM-2 missile was tested on the Bladovoy wasteland.
This missile was about 1.4 m long, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high-altitude wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The heir of the first RM missiles was Meteor-1 missile, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designed as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket was a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1V - 0.34 liters, and Meteor-1C - 0.62 l.
The maximum range of flight in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute developed a Meteor-2 missile, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to bring out a payload weighing 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the KOSPAR (Committ on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the National Committee of KOSPAR two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland participated in space explorations on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The abolition of the law on public works is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
The resolution triggered a lively discussion in the society.
Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at this problematics from a broader point of view.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that some economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital along with unbridified financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of labor (spending fee) there is a price voltage.
Under this concept, you need to understand the state when the manufacturer, through the delivery of cheap goods, tries to survive in economic competition by the fact that "does" the cost of the competitor in order to take the most part of the market and, thus, increase their own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result, unemployment increases in those in countries where the cost of labor, compared to others, high.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, including for the unemployment, the unavoidable expenditures of the state for social needs are growing.
In general, the situation strengthens the reluctance of the state-owned entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social and social damage they have in the perpetuation of profit.
The situation is so well known that you do not need to provide specific statistical data.
Unceremonious methods of private capital create at the level of economies of individual states situations when governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give their own population to arbitrariness private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the current legislation.
The goal is to economically force their people to submit to the dictatorship of private capital, primarily in the field of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labor legislation.
As a result, the level of poverty increases, and at the same time the difference between the poor and the rich.
In Germany for several years there has been a public distribution of products to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constant cases when employed people receive such a salary that the state should pay them extra to get a subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic fall of social status are forced to either emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to exist for a beating salary on the backyards of society in the hope that private investment capital will come to the country sometime.
But it is asked where he will come from?
If the capital comes from other EU countries, the poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as the Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for the share of European wages.
This applies to all Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim to be naute that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, which leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital persistently insists that the state should not interfere with the economy.
Next, it is necessary to answer the question whether private capital is not functioning, now practically the governing of politics and the whole state, for its own selfish purposes?
The unequivocal answer is yes.
The evidence is the existence of almost omnipotence and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
As a result, we have a difficult situation in corruption, mutual benefits, in legislation where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is that the state ministries, due to the lack of financial resources, are instructed to develop bills to private legal firms, which are closely related to the industry.
Then these bills are approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitution says, but from financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberally-oriented democracy is now quickly found in such a situation as Appian described in the work "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompeii": "The state has long been disintegrating, and the departments are engaged in violence.
Takes, illegal receipt of graces with the help of stones and swords.
The bribery and corruption thrived without any bans, and people went to elections with a pre-sold voice" ." . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . St.
As in antiquity, modern society is dominated by their reckless interests without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is not essentially intended for use for public purposes.
The present result does not differ from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
This means that we should look for the reason for the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the reckless liberalization of economic systems of 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be perceived as a pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the present elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already observing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The abolition of the law on public works is not a solution or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition both at the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus, this trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the share participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the state administration and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in the society in favor of the state.
Israel: The Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will come out of violence, and can never come out" - Sting, the song "Fragile," where the main verse of the refrain is the words: "Do not forget which we are fragile."
"If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't have been" - Gutel Schnaper, Meer's wife Amsheel Rothschild.
The last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, has caused a lot of responses.
Some advocate Israel, reasoning his position that he has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support Palestinians, arguing this by the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on who in these periodically repeated waves of murder - the criminal, and who is the victim, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and were not witnesses of the beginning of violence.
My goal is to offer readers to look behind the curtain, to look at who is primarily for 95 years of tension (counting from the signing of the Declaration of Balfur in November 1917) on a small plot of the land of the Middle East.
Some of my reasonings are backed by historical facts, some of them are derived from me on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main engine of events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily the story of the struggle for power.
In each epoch we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear - whether these people always took their steps on their own, or behind their trot was someone who directed their actions to predetermined goals.
It should be assumed that we live in a period when the world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several persons, and that this concentration of money and the passing power of them could not happen for the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families stands out one that could be regarded as a head of a squat (I don't know if someone is over them, but it is not excluded) - Rothschilds.
They are not written much about.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 90s of the 19th century to stop rumors linking their name to criminal actions in the higher spheres, in the shadow of which they were, and who have always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase of wealth or at the same time, and to both.
They have large stakes in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, they conduct or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq became 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but at the same time the Russian government took the central bank of its country into its hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Avraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of a central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, during the civil war he began to issue his own (understoic - government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963. Deputy Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for the unleashing of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of the plan of the three world wars created by the great mason of the 33rd level Albert Paik.
The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchic states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially the UK, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world population to approximately 0.5-1 billion people (this number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (the state can be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of power.
The method with which a group of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the basis of the FED, which was supposed to prevent the recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to launch the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir of the Austrian-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia, starting a Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, unfounded military and economic capitulation of Germany (there was no need for war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, the Central European Power, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was fragmented.
In order to facilitate the unleashing of World War II, the bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict, putting on Germany huge military reparations, than they created a precondition for the radicalization of the depleted masses, then there was only to throw the Germans strong enough, denouncing the perpetrators and offering simple decisions of the Whisman, then to create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played the function of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned declaration Balfur created a premise for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had escaped from the chains in which the bankers originally held him, or everything he did, was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for the 2nd World War II, the state of Israel was proclaimed to create a center of war of the third.
If international bankers manage to unleash it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will be a victim of hostilities on the front line, now, together with the Arab or, simply put, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of dissence and chaos not only within the country, but also on the international level (to take only a sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment causes offense in an endless chain of violence, if everything began with the greed of individuals and their aspiration for world power?
It is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers push people to vote exclusively their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to international bankers, making everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), will threaten to develop into a world conflict, and given the control of Iran over the Ormuz Strait, containing 20% of all world reserves of oil, will only lead to a world corridor (the ship's world-wide corridor.
In what light now the words said by David Rockefeller in 1994 are manifested: "All we need is a common crisis, and people will accept a new world order."
The new world order in their conception is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where each born organism at birth implants a chip with which it becomes a creature under total control.
And makes all the small and large, rich, and the poor, the free, and the slaves, have on his right hand or on his forehead a border, so that a man who is not seen by the name of that beast, or the number of his name, can neither buy sell.
This is the wisdom: every man with understanding can count the number of beasts.
For it is the name of the man, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
Film "Operation "Argo": When there is nowhere worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist demonstrators captured the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took hostage of 52 diplomats.
They had to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlev, who fled after the revolution in the United States, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not expected - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it could radically undermine the trust of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later was strengthened by an unsuccessful attempt to release hostages by force.
The inmates were finally released 444 days after the negotiations with the mediation of the Algerian government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential elections, which ended in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film directed by the actor Ben Affleck "Operation "Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six employees managed to escape.
After a difficult peripetia, they finished their journey at the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them out of Iran, at the same time helped an extravagant legend of cover, according to which they went on Canadian passports as members of the film crew, looking for a place in the country to shoot a sci-fi epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented the expert on "evacuation" Tony Mendes, demanded the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend reliable, in specialized magazines it was written about the project of the film, held press conferences, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film, based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Afflek's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "movie-moving," the story of a successful idea, scams - an example can be a number of films about friends of Ausen.
The film constantly changes moods - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the captions show iconic historical photographs of events and how the same situations were shown in the film - there is no big difference in this).
On the other hand, the lightened Hollywood passages, intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in costumes discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone...
Ben Afflecu was able to make a relaunch of his career.
From the ridiculed actor became a respected director, and his game ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Argo Operation" his third feature film, after the dark detective "Farewell, Child, Protivity" (2007) and Thriller "City" (2010).
At the same time, this is the first film of Affleck, which is not filmed in the native city of the director - Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place at the same time refers to the qualities that elevate the earlier films of the director over the Hollywood standard.
And Afflek shows this in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film occur on the streets, during the reconstruction of real events - the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy impress with its clarity, which also conveys emotions of confusion and unforeseen, which arise when somewhere suddenly the history changes.
A similar effect of Afflek and his colleagues reach in the scenes fictional (sub-for-made headquarters in the Teheran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not imply many exciting scenes of cinematic importance.
He works quite successfully with this few, sometimes something thinks - there it all goes out so elegantly (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at the airport of Tehran, and the chase on the runway look quite imaginary).
The disadvantage of "Argo" is the dissection associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Gudman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are really very obessian, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
Afflek's film lacks a bit of drama, a film that can be watched with moderate interest, assessing the production and retro style, recreating the thrillers of the seventies.
But it is hard to capture.
However, this is enough to remind one, still in a certain sense of living history, as well as for evidence of exaggerated ideas about almighty and all-knowing special services.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd decision or a project from the EU workshop."
"We have been encouraged by the latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in the administration of major European companies," said the organizer of the questionnaire Patrick Nager.
Among those already nominated for the nomination of absurdities is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unite the insurance premium rates for men and women.
Until now, women have had life insurance benefits, because for insurance companies they are objectively less risky.
"Forry incredible ideas from the EU workshop, people can put forward to the competition until the end of this year.
The voting itself will be held until the end of February 2013," Nager said.
The controversial orders of the EU include, for example, the obligatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which result in harm to nature, as well as the ban on the use of reliable mercury graduators only because they contain a relatively small amount of dangerous substances, or a cage-staining cell for chickens, as a result of which eggs have significantly risen this year.
Also criticized is the actual ban on the use of the term "sand oil" or removal from the sale of classic light bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters in length.
The European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a particular commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of states (this way the Czech Republic now even under the threat of a veterinarian defends the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, the bananas of the highest quality in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show an abnormal curvature.
At the same time, the European Commission justified itself by the fact that only harmonizes the existing disparate national rules, which complicate trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some countries, has still softened the standards relating to fruits and vegetables, citing the fact that the existing directives will lead to waste of food.
The candidate for winning in the survey may become the last year's EU resolution, according to which the sold balloons must be subject to a warning that children under eight years of age can not inflate them unattended adults.
The EU has appealed to American studies, according to which balloons in the game are a potential cause of death of children through suffocation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age, who are forbidden to blow into fair dude.
sedative ideas are born at home
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is absurd: everyone in the EU can not, given the delicacy of the topic for Greece, use the name Macedonia, instead of saying "BYURM" (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal Bankovn'poplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists "The principle of non-interference" (Laissez Faire), proposed for voting, in addition to a few of the above absurd rules, for example, the rule of the EU on the volume of food reserves in the territory of a member state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food reserves that may be located in the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Later, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it faced a large fine.
The questionnaire organizers were also interested in the idea to pay some countries for the fact that they do not have the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies for the application for subsidies.
But these ideas arose in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are in an unprofitable position, because we do not have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palace in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that there was a high grain harvest in the country, and as a result of so-called interventional purchases the state had complete stocks that had to be taken out.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to Palais, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
Subsidies for the subsidy were proposed to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Paul Nemts (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to go to draft applications for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: The bizarre orders are an exception
Although the decisions in the member states are easily becoming the object of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve recognition.
According to experts, a serious problem is the draw of EU subsidies for projects that do not even have a hint of something in common with the deepening of the European integration, but which the member states have achieved during the discussion of the budget.
It is a feeling of emotion among the Czechs and the fact that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic should fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrians retained the name "Olowetski cheeses," but "Tuszemsky rum," whose traditions in our country are rooted in the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename to "Tusemak."
Only products from cane distillate, not from sugar beet can be named rum.
In the official list of registered EU products, along with the world-famous cheeses "feta" and "horgondzola," marzipan from the German Ljubeck or Parma ham, have already been, for example, Karlovy Vary, Pogorzheli and Trichbone carp and cheat Khmelsk.
Also, the EU trademark can be proud of Pardubian gingerbread and Gorzhitsky tubes.
People want me to protect the republic, but I'm an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a person come to the head to run for president?
I don't think of becoming a senator or president.
If everything in our country functioned without problems, I would not have been running anywhere.
But I can no longer see how over the past 20 years the country has been being robbed, how thieves are fussed here, people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to find a solution how to change it.
And since I've been forty years old and I'm an independent person who doesn't belong to any party, I have no other way to influence things other than to run for a senator or president.
In the Senate you got, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Do you turn your back to the people you have chosen?
I have always said that I will be involved in the struggle for the presidential castle, depending on the result of the elections to the Senate.
Later, I specified that if I was chosen as a senator, I will run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool with which I can exercise my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the widest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we are murmuring in our bar or TV, but at the same time ready to trample anyone who will try to change something.
This is added to the media that blackter a person, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, they told me that I gave bribes to journalists, or that I was an advisor to Jiri Paroubek.
Let's move on to your eyes.
The fight for the presidential castle you started with the thesis about the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the reverse property declarations worth more than twenty million.
In order to do this, it is necessary to change the law.
You do not have such powers as president, and only a whole senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I lobbyed as a citizen to make excursions free entrepreneurship, it was possible to promote.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good proposal on the left or right, he is deliberately obstructed, and this restrains citizens.
As an independent non-party person, I have much greater potential to support all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I am without party-closing on the shelves, without looking back at the sage, I can take from each party what is the best for our country, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a person who is more of the right or the left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people treat me rather to the left.
It doesn't matter to me at all - a little left or a little right.
It is important for me that we go forward.
It is not about the fact that someone treats the right, but someone to the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good decision for society whether it will offer the CCP or PD, and I will also oppose a bad idea.
You are angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove this by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some perfect goals and views.
And you try to get closer to that.
We can call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already functioning in the world, or prominent experts talk about them.
But you will have only slogans without the support of the Parliament.
And with this in politics you will not stay for a long time.
Or do you think that when you come out to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another possibility.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to our side so that we can achieve our own.
If I were elected president, I would not have had a problem to organize a live TV broadcast, in which I would appeal to the chairpersons of parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And in case of refusal, they will have to report why they do not want it.
If there is a strong person who voices abuses, it will be possible to exert pressure on the political scene.
Take direct presidential elections - it was a merit of pressure from the public.
I say directly that I am a lover, not a genius and not an intellectual.
I try to seek allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I'm just starting in politics, and for my program I will try to get the support of the majority.
I try to promote myself; if it is not possible, in six years I will finish and return to the private sector.
This partially sounds as if Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that I will do nothing alone, so I bypassed a number of famous people with a proposal to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchur, he refused due to the large amount of work.
I also supported journalist Jan Lorentsov, presenter of the investigation, who revealed the fraud with light fuel oil products.
I have nominated my candidacy because people are not satisfied, but now I feel on the scales.
Sixty percent of people did not vote, and the majority of those who chose the establishment.
We are only two independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be carried out with difficulty.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.
Do you think about the foundation of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the purity of the past of every potential supporter, and I don't have money for that.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand crowns.
Do you have no money?
You are talking about property declarations, and how do your own business with this?
Personal property is estimated at about 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment of 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of works of art by about 10 million, Aston-Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, well, a few million more on the account.
By the way, Aston-Martin had me, because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against slander and lawlessness.
Do you go to Aston-Martin, own a property of 60 million and you don't have money to campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you do not want to invest your own money.
This is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I get into debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I do not have sponsors shows that my program is not so interesting.
And I am not obliged to pay for the election campaign from my pocket.
The expenses for the campaign will essentially cover the senatorial salary.
But for this money I would not have lived, for example, could not pay my son for an English school, which costs 30 thousand monthly.
If I wanted only to make money, I wouldn't have been running anywhere.
So you will continue to engage in business to be able to live?
Have you not said that you will shorte this activity?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activity.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like me to be a non-degreas that would keep the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which he also receives further.
And if I had become president, I would have finished my business.
You will find a full interview in the Saturday issue of the newspaper "Law."
Architects MVRDV prove that real adventures are not only in imagination - on the example of Spacekenis and its newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, at last we can see something interesting again," - says Lisette Verhaiig, driving on the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, a IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, believes: "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself: why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad and e-books.
Now no one voluntarily goes to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spaikeniss, a low-thin remarkable residential town near Rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record.
Its population is 80,000 people with the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this annoyance a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on the euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely painted miniatures made of reinforced concrete.
The success of this enlightenment was modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they had the only opportunity to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Vini Maas from the Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, a master of bold column diagrams and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, treated the task with his usual serenity and appeared on a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a slurry on the face.
And while the jury looked puzzled and shrugged, the daring Maas folded from his original gift a pyramid in size and completed the speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal: "The Book Mountain" in Spaikeniss, the so-called Buckenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain worth 30 million euros has grown.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, mail and several adjacent residential buildings and townhouses in total for 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second prize of the contest "The Best Library of the Netherlands 2012."
The project also participates in the national Dutch competition of wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, the imitable suburb, which before could not offer anything but the post-modern pedestrian zone and surprisingly ugly Town Hall, the white facades of which lead to the idea of a dairy, became richer on one modern work of architecture.
But most importantly - in Speykenis appeared the first in the history of this town public building of cultural purpose.
Long road to the book
First impression: book Eldorado under the cap for cheese.
There is only one elevator passing in the center of the mountain range, because real fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
The room glazed on all sides is light and light and easily visible, floors of burned bricks and elegant street lights unmistakably create a feeling of public city square.
The urban environment is perfectly recreated.
The look is unwittingly looking for benches, dogs and football boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Usually book shelves stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless," - says Vini Maas.
We put the classic configuration of the space from head toe and pulled the reading zone from inside out.
The inner space of the book mountain is used skillfully: the center has offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and technical rooms.
Especially please the black books shelves, which serve as the finishing of the walls, the parapets, the stair railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and builders are lost in guessing what it is for the unknown material.
"We tried to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Traborst, project manager representing the Spacekenis community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once at one agricultural enterprise in Frisland we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a lining under the roots used artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness.
It is cheap and saves time.
The thin textiles serve one or two seasons, after that it can be thrown away.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was pressed in a panel of four centimeters thick.
Under the action of heat and pressure, the so-calledlandbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, smelling a little like a new car and a little sneakers.
105 steps are leading to the top.
Those who overcome the path length of almost 500 meters, will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only fantastic view of the city, but also Dutch croquet and wood ficus in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and first of all about the right humidity on the literary mountain.
Costs of a new soul
"It is difficult to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a exemplary project in terms of ecology," - says Trouborst.
For its heating and cooling used the heat of the ground.
Although the Book Mountain stands under the glass cap, even in clear days the sun gets inside only for a short time.
Wide farms made of glued wood, located perpendicular to the glass facade, give a shadow and take on most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roll curtains.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above by the skeptic from the IT sector, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verhaiig was also here.
As well as the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, who called Buckenberg "the soul of Spacemens, which has long been lacking."
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from his own meeting.
These books had to take empty seats on the shelves of the not yet fully equipped library - at that time there were 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The sluges are upside down.
"Nothing worse than a half-empty library," says the architect Vini Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident is now in some way connected with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it serves only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal problem, which in professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Spaikeniss wrote his literary story.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
This is only the starting point for constructing identity.
Sabo: "Germans should play a more important role"
Germany abstained from voting for the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, acting so, Berlin balances on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against Palestinians" application for the status of an observer to the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Now Germany needs to be cautious in connection with its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without speaking too critical to Israel.
During the Libyan Upris in March 2011, Germany also refrained from voting for the introduction of a restricted zone for flights.
As a result, NATO made this proposal.
Germany finds it difficult to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, that's it.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, moving from a policy, which, so to speak, was managed by the United States, to the actual German foreign policy.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a coordinated unified policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that so far they only find their role, but are on the way to "more normal" foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy as France or the UK pursues.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
This is a willingness to take a position in its national interests, not depending on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on the economic policy, that is, on exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are largely different from the interests of other major states, and therefore Germany must defend its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it is necessary to exercise caution in order not to offend the public and elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its role.
But I wouldn't attach too much importance to it, it's not a completely unilateral connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Did Germany have its relationship with the United States, abstaining in making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that the understanding of the German position prevails in Europe and even the United States.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even acquire this particular respect.
After all, this signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be taken into account.
There are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, the United States clearly supported the veto.
Is there a discrepancy between the United States and many European states?
Due to the American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama government has a sufficient understanding of the European position in the depths of our hearts.
But in connection with the local political situation, the government, of course, cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that significant differences in opinions are not as significant as it always seems.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not delighted with Netanyahu's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be somewhat easier for the Germans if there was a united, consistent European policy, but now it is not so.
Therefore, they cannot act within a broader approach and are forced to act instead, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
That is how they come with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take a leading role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of ties with Israel.
This topic has always been tickling.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it really take the main role?
Or is Germany still a difficult role?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to this, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, is still difficult to play a significant role.
Let's consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes an important role, there are a variety of anti-German feelings.
It is not easy for the Germans to cope with this.
Actually, this is an old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much heavier position than the United States.
It should take into account various neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, the influence of the United States in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans will just have to play a more significant role.
Even if you do not like it, it is unpleasant or amplifies the dislike for you - this is life!

"Graming trademark protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani - the world-famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren - too.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the firms from the names of which it is formed.
However, it will be guarded until the owners of the original names file a claim.
But even then it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattleloch, attorney at Taylor Wessing, specializing in trademark violations in the Far East.
On my table every week appears on a new business of this kind.
It is enough for imitators to add only a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci turns Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies, such as the manufacturer of sports goods Puma, are legally copied.
Pattlekh opens a folder with records of the trademark registration department in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered there a trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also used the name of the fashionable house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese - world champions in copying and violation of intellectual property rights, is known.
In large cities there are multi-storey departments, selling almost exclusively fake.
However, Pattlech's cases are not the same. On behalf of his trustees, he opposes the fact that Chinese enterprises officially receive the right to use the name, which is already protected somewhere else from the department of registration of trademarks.
The Chinese call it "ban of minpai," a brand-passenger.
This word is associated with "ban dakuan."
So they call women who hunt for the rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize the guilt
"This is detrimental to business, it is necessary to fight it," Pattlekh believes.
"The trade mark is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image suffers very much."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected sectors are calculated by millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China with sales of 15 billion euros per year is the third largest and fastest growing luxury market.
However, it is difficult to achieve the removal of dubious records in the register of trademarks, and it is expensive.
The process can last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattlekh talks about the cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits, as after a long time the protested name became the "market reality."
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarism, as it has caused damage to his trademark in China, says Pattlech.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases about graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost the dispute with the manufacturer of Sany construction machines, a company that shortly before acquired the manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo-wond company Geely originally used a blue-white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who had the famous crocodile looking in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The CTMO trademark registration department in Beijing confirms that in 2010 due to the lack of personnel and equipment of the premises there were difficulties.
But last year there was a "return from an emergency in the working process to the norm."
Thus, the number of untreated objections decreased by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still waiting for production in the department.
Fighting with this is expensive
As very often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China for the tenth time in a row topped the list of new registrations around the world, according to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of actual trademarks, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan fees were paid.
If you simplify, it means that each registration costs an average of 1280 RIA or 160 euros.
Protest it is worth many times more, as the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarism.
The Germans managed to ensure that the illegal production of fake automobile parts was eliminated.
However, the imitator secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was an omission because the surnames in Germany are not subject to protection, says Hanno Ventzler, Chairman of the Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO sales registration department rejected the claim of the Munichs.
However, in both of the following instances Freudenberg won, but the opposite side continues to fight so far.
It is necessary to be on the check
Now the question is under consideration in the Supreme Court.
The ventsler hopes to bring the matter to a good completion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes away a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs are hardly accountable, the company's archive had to review even acts of a hundred years ago to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposite side "a large six-digit sum in euro" for the settlement.
"It's clear how expensive it is for us," says Ventzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
Namely, if the imitators register there for unprotected trade signs.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for leather shoes and leather products.
The Concern has long stopped production in these areas, but despite this it was able to prevent registration.
"You need to be on the eye," says Ventzler.
Both he and Pattlekh's lawyer recommend German businesses to be very cautious with China.
It is not enough to rely on international regulations on trademark protection, rather foreigners should "everything that should be protected in any way, also registered in China," - says Ventzler.
Otherwise, it can cost much more than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his drama about the trademark, he will have to pay the opposite side the license fees for his own name, explains Ventzler.
Otherwise we will be replaced from the market in the controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: to flood, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the choir of Imbonga is rehearsed - and in Swaziland orphans of AIDS rejoice in this.
The history of relations that have traveled distances more than 8733 kilometers.
First, the flooding is distributed: carpet boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boats and men's slippers pick up the tay on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
Once or two-three-four.
Only after that slowly increase the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - they come, fascinate and follow each other.
And Fyth Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his fabric shoes, when he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday evening, in the musical hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir of Imbongi rehearsing a new song.
The rehearsal came fifty participants of the choir from 23 to 69 years, from a specialist in human genetics to the wiper.
"Om'Obani" is a difficult thing, every voice of the choir has its own text, moreover in a completely alien language: Zulus, which speaks eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to Unaids, United Nations AIDS programs, there are about 34 million HIV-positive people in the world.
23.5 million of them live in the south of Africa.
Swaziland is home to 245,000 orphans of AIDS.
At the same time, more than 40 percent of the population is positive.
For 180 orphans of AIDS in the village of Esitzheni, Voices for Africa found chefs in Germany.
70 of them attend a school preparing for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can take over the patronage.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniform and daily hot lunch at Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu language means a storyteller or praiser.
In this hall they do not speak fluently on the bow, but they know how to sing.
For almost ten years, the choir learns songs in this soft language and occasionally even brings them again to where they first appeared: in the south of Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers of summer from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitzhani, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Infected forty percent
There are about 2000 people living there, some still in simple clay huts and straw, among the inhabitants there are many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the ICH virus.
The miniature reflects the disease of the entire Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the world's lowest life expectancy, according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of the foreskin in men, which is proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry a virus of immunodeficiency, death in the middle of the fourth ten - not uncommon.
The choir opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants of Imbogni saw many children on the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but also just everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school education, a person in a poor country has no chances at all.
At first it was a private obligation of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa," which since then almost professionally cares about orphans of AIDS in Esitzhen.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial IPPP include syphilysis, chlavalio and tripper (gonorium).
Frequent viruses are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Pulkovy pediculosis and scabies refer to parasitic STIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Cyphilia and gonorrhea are mostly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute presumes that at least four of each five cases of syphilis registered in Germany are transmitted as a result of sexual contact between men.
Heterosexual adult people often encountered sexually transmitted diseases are chramid infections, trichomoniasis, diandiosis (fung), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
We have relatively low HIV distribution among heterosexual adult - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections account for this group.
Among young people chramid infections are significantly more common than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections hit young people from 15 to 25 years.
We also often encounter human papillomavirus among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the incidence of syphilis has more than doubled from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate venereal disease?
In infectious diseases, ulcers may occur in the genitals, urination complaints, secretion, lower abdominal pain, as well as bubbles or seals.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can I protect myself?
Condoms are able to reduce the risk of infection, but do not give 100% protection.
After all, partly pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be distributed by contact infection and with close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, especially in the frequent change of sexual partners.
In early diagnosis, most of the STIs can be cured and avoid remote consequences.
The chefs, donations and not least fees for the performances of the choir throughout Germany allow something to be collected.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitsjani," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, the money from Germany is managed by Zodva Dlomeni, a conscious and active woman.
She also cares that orphans are well arranged, for example, in one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call the Zulu old women, is the support of the village.
Some of them took up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and ensure that children in shape every day appear in time in time.
Those who have no relatives come to the shelter to Chaniysil, a lonely woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two chefs, who are preparing for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, the "Voices for Africa" organized a sewing school, built two chicken coops and together with the American organization for health protection PSI organized the test on HIV for many villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, prefer to be deeply silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annenete Lennartz, "because he is associated with sexuality."
Quite unusual for the country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Msvati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such an authorized state lifestyle also lies the fault for the fact that the virus of the ICH so quickly spread in the past years.
But it also lies on stray workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are on every corner, says Annette Lennertz, "but they are almost not used.
Another culture is flesh to the flesh."
To support the cultural exchange a little, the choir of Ibmohni every two or three years makes a trip to South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many on the southern edge of the black continent know since apartheid.
A bus full of white, which sing songs in black - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, it happened, caused tears in the eyes of severe border guards.
The trip always leads also to Esitzheni, where singers visit the children.
Despite the fact that a small village can hardly be found on the map, in the valley of the river Etsulveni it is more than known.
"Go to Esitzheni, there is light," say the local people.
And after the 8733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when the drowning singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also lit here.
Messenger: NASA opens ice on Mercury
The "Messenger" probe has found evidence that Mercury has ice on the planet.
Ice cover can have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. Space Agency NASA proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as it appears from three studies published on Thursday in a special journal Science.
The "Messenger" probe has found evidence that the planet's region is constantly in the shadow of the planet covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water occurs with a comet or perhaps an asteroid encountered Mercury.
No one connects the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the supervisor of the probe Sean Solomon.
The Mercury temperature can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other construction elements of life have come to other places of the Solar System.
It is in noticeable for the inhabitants of the Earth probes, telescopes and small robots, such as "Philics," explore the depths of the Universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small cats in endless gave.
The image comes from the camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our Solar System, as well as the dwarf planet Cerera.
Like Pluto, which speaks around the Sun behind Neptune, Cerera, according to the new definition of the international astronomical union of 2006, is not a "planet."
This fragment of the "Spitzer" telescope's infrared picture presents a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, it is more difficult to identify pink "newborn" stars in the star circle.
This star-formation region - scientists call it non-romanticly - open by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This overseating heat of a dying star photographed the NASA Spitzer telescope.
The ring similar to the Don's Don's Ring consists of a material that the star threw away during dying.
In the giant nebula of Trifide, remote for 5400 light years from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA's telescope "Spitzer" made this photo of the galactic maternity hall.
The star cluster of Pleiades, also called "Sea sisters," can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with a telescope color is getting better.
How red eyes agitates the nebula of the Witness on this infrared picture.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation of Aquarius.
The similarity with the earthly continent has brought this nebula nickname "North America."
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides expressive color reproduction.
This new star in all beauty was able to be photographed only with the help of infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: How they emerged - one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps these are the fragments of the Saturn's moon, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the greatest and clearest images of the Hubble telescope: the galaxy Water
Depending on the color reproduction of the images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory, the picture shows the skirming of Trifid remote for several thousand light years in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-sealed, three-divided), as dark dust strips divide into three parts the hot heart of the star cradle.
In the constellation of the Snake-bearer, astronomers photographed the forerbist of the cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light years from Earth the nucleus of the two galaxies are driving towards each other and will inevitably collide.
This is the birth of the star telescope "Hubble" filmed in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who does not like technical cuts can call it by the nickname "Southern Celek".
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows Iris's nebula fragment in the constellation of Cethea.
The fog, removed for 1400 light years, consists of dust particles, the size of which is ten to a hundred times less than that of ordinary home dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, remote for 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed the space telescope "Hubble" for NASA.
The great spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of new stars of our Milky Way.
The star cradle constantly creates new stars.
It is a star cloud connected to the Rosette nebula, also constantly creates new stars - at a distance of 5000 light years from the Earth.
In this brightly luminous galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it originated shortly before the Big Bang, when the Universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our views into the Universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lipersgey - even before Galileo Galileo began to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more - and the spaces available to their eyes are getting deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the "Hale" telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, installed "Big binocular telescope."
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The "Grand of Telescopeo Canarios" has a giant internal device - the diameter of the mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The "Big South African Telescope" mirrored in South Africa - in order to reduce cost.
However, in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
The lack of inexpensive design: the telescope is rigidly fastened at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberley telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its peculiarity: high light-to-equip ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Aresibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Particit in the project "Seterless Mind search" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing his computing power.
View of the observatory of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands "Very large telescope" - completely corresponding to its name.
Its four mirrors allow to illuminate even the middle infrared spectrum in the optic pipe.
In the Chilean Observatory ESO is also planned to install the European "Very large telescope."
Its main mirror should stretch for as much as 42 meters - and will be composed of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected before 2018.
Until 2007, both Kek telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Kek telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which along with them looks into the sky also with the help of "Subaru" and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope should appear on Mauna-Kea - with a mirror of thirty meters in diameter.
Here they can admire the illustrations.
However, the most important species from space is supplied by the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been delivering pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for planets outside the Solar System - above all those on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets were discovered since the beginning of the mission.
The photo shows the latest preparations of the space telescope "Kepler."
James Webb's space telescope (JWST) will be sent to space not earlier than 2018 on board the Arian 5 missile.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope tasks: it must by the light of the first stars and the galaxy look for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that Mercury has ice at the southern pole.
However, there is no reliable information about this, as the "Messenger" revolves closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades have pointed out that Mercury has ice.
Thanks to the "Messenger" probe launched in 2004 - the first one that revolves around Mercury - scientists are now confident in this.
Drink oil every day - and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical respected age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for the solution in a country where 97-year-old elders seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical respected age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for the solution in a country where 97-year-old elders seem relatively young.
The trip through the Talysh Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The minibus with thunder rolls along the winding road past the thickened hills, stormy rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything around so green and bright that one might think you'd be in the Black Forest.
But this is the southernmost land of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
There live the Tals - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, which is known a little, except that they speak perfectly well on Farsi and Azerbaizhdansky and are longevity.
The end point is Lerik.
The small town is giamped by too heavy architecture of Soviet times, which does not harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost do not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tedious.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, to the province, has not yet reached.
However, Pilate Fatulayev (48) is convinced that in Lerik there is something to interest tourists.
"In May, Baku was famous for the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will host a festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulaeva says.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
It documented the biography of about eight dozen bats from these places, which are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he is 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child
But the controversial star of the museum is Shirala Muslumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate, however.
And given the fact that the oldest person, whose age is confirmed by documents, turned 122 years old, the age of Mueslumova seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 years he allegedly had a daughter.
So has he added the herder of the Mueslumov a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher of age from the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of the long-lived people in Central Asia.
"A lot of people of advanced age can also be found in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "Sardinia also lives very many very old people."
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age is impossible, because there were no registers of civil status.
Every day a glass of drip oil
However, there is a fact that people in the area of Lerik are amazingly often reaching Biblical age.
Now there are 20 people over 100 years old.
Why are there so many long-lived here in the south?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mumizade explains it by special genes of the malaria.
Director of the museum Fatulaeva, on the contrary, believes that it is a matter of nutrition.
Talushi loves meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink a glass of hot oil every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it a matter of primitive way of life that preserves people's youth? In Chengeran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubab Mirzoev.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims that she has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasian region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which is tirelessly rolling here and there.
Here, eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and daughter, who have long had their grandchildren.
Also nearby are two kids jump.
In the kitchen, guests are prepared tea, which is served in typical pus of armusu.
Mirzaeva has perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, under the head handkerchief she hides the long dark-haired braids, which her son proudly reveals in front of us.
I'm always my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I have never used shampoo," says Mirzaeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, polka dots.
All my life I have never bought products in the store.
Then she tells about her husband who served in the army.
The hardest thing was after World War II.
But it became better when "favorite father" Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm.
Propaganda does not often sound in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, which rules the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan almost does not know the boundaries.
He was in power until 2003, then the reins of government received his son Ilham.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijanis.
230 AZN (approximately the same amount of euro) Mirzaeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions this is the amount for which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzaeva's son has long grown up is also right: "Old people in our culture have deep respect."
They live in a big family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
Than no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing in the constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo testify to the deep split of the country.
The future constitution based on Sharia met a fierce rebuff.
The Egyptian president did not skimp on the pathos.
We must create a transition.
"And his success lies on my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on the state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, so far hopelessly divided in the belita, are afraid.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile on the grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi, almost apologized, said that he temporarily cut off the competence of the constitutional court and expanded his competence "to save the revolution."
However, what actually wants to save 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles managed to drag in the night 15-hour jump with obstacles to the Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this partially raises concerns.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says that legal proceedings are based on "princips of Islamic law."
But what does "principal" mean?
This was and remains a matter of interpretation, and we can fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the legal backlash for a more stringent interpretation of Sharia.
At least, one new article suggests this: in all matters relating to Sharia, the University of Al-Ashar, the most important Islamist institution of the country, which enjoys great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be attracted to the council.
This should not, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which de facto would have been a consequence of the restriction of the judiciary.
In the draft constitution, much is the subject of interpretation
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians to the military court should remain.
These courts during the power of Mubarak served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in prison.
Also, as stated in the project, the state must protect the "true essence of the Egyptian family" and "support its morality and values."
This is legally formulated so fuzzy that state institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of film and literature.
This means that in an open text, nothing but censorship.
In general, no article sets directly equality of men and women.
But the other forbids insulting and debauching the prophet Mohammed and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also doubtful to formulate that "insulting people" is prohibited.
Will there be enough caricatures for the president or jokes about the legal adviser?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this project, which Mursi proposes to sign and which, according to him, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"Revolution has come back"
The opposition has been forming the opposition against the superiority of the Islamists for several weeks.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and scorned to destroy this document before he could come into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbakhi, who took third place in the presidential election.
Laureate of the Nobel Peace Prize and the former head of the international department for nuclear energy Mohammed El Baradei said that the draft constitution place "on the dump of history."
Through Twitter's short news service, he accused Mursi's adherents of wanting to lead the "confident against democracy."
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and throw it off," said the opposition leader Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet apologist," - quoted the Egyptian media opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Many judges also said that they do not want to watch the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
Well organized "Muslim Brotherhood," in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, from precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of the University of Cairo.
It was attended by a large number of women under cover and adherents of Salafists, who shouted: "The people require the application of God's law."
They demanded Mursi, "Currect the country!" and assured them, "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area, on which it all began, provoked the state of practically civil war.
Mursi's followers obviously did not want to take this risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke loudly and clearly.
Now it is time to give the people to decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
Most of the Islamists" project is considered a settled matter.
"The concept of "human rights" is not mentioned once"
Hafiz Abu Saed is furious with this accelerated constitutional process, which, in general, was supposed to last until February with the participation of all public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOPR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison under Mubarak or presented before the court.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" never meet in the new constitution, he regrets in conversation with "Welt am Sonntag."
The expansion of Mursi's influence on all three branches of power in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures represent clear blows on the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civilian state, the president de facto annulled it," Saeda regrets.
After all, without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even an international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
For this may come payment.
The demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns, "You are creating a monster that you will not be able to control."
Norwegian racist: the most badly smelling fish in the world?
The five-millionth population of Norway has one of the highest levels of life not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Perhaps the mystery of the success of this country is somehow associated with the local passion for one extremely foul fish dish?
Take a few over-your pieces of cheese.
put them in a bunch of dirty and pork sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get a devastating smell of smell of racarfish - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
Around the snow-covered picturesque views. It is very beautiful, but in the air spills an indestinable characteristic smell.
Rakfisk - is a trout sprinkled with salt and wandering in the water up to a year, depending on what kind of shower you need to achieve.
As the condensate of the slump and colds, the crowds of Norwegians gather for the festival in Fagernes, dedicated to this, say, exciting dish.
"It is eaten raw and drunk with a glass of water and water-crew, local uminuminous vodka," explains Havard Hanvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and part-time "rackish general," who leads the festival.
People around us eat fish chopped with small cubes and drink it with considerable portions of alcohol.
"Singer likes aquavit more than araksque," Havard says.
This drink is able to interrupt the smell.
I try a couple of pieces.
If you manage to carry a piece under the nose, then everything is not so bad - little different from the portion of the land, which you have carried with you for a long time in the bus.
Rakfisek is a Norwegian product from completely different times, times of poverty, when, even before the appearance of refrigerators, fish in the autumn soaked in hermetically closed barrels of salt water.
Then in a deep winter, when the fish already well and thoroughly fermented, it was extracted and, mowing the perception of alcohol, used to eat.
Even in the memory of the last generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly in the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, who attract jobs, high salaries and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (the long-distance rival, and not so long ago and much more prosperous neighbor) massively come here to work.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, irresound, albeit a few stinky element of the past Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or sandwich will cost you 9 pounds sterling (14 USD).
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most of the inhabitants of the country it seems to be satisfied.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, racist and extreme right-wing, last year shot and killed 77 men, women and children.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called "the incident on July 22."
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
Norway's prosperity is based on the growth (since the early seventies) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"However, oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, carrying tray with aging racfian, a woman with long blond hair and amazing blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are such a people - as you call it - reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English perfectly.
We do not like to be exhibited for display, we are not boastful.
Norway is very careful about its oil industry - most of the oil and gas industry revenues are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years preceding the global financial crisis, when everyone was torn off with money they did not have, Norway carefully calculated all costs.
"While you can ski in winter and go on hiking in the summer, it is enough for happiness," - says Anna.
"And there is a rakfisk," she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in the snow in line for some food - the scrib-scarf from me is enough.
Here is a hamburger with elk meat - it's definitely exotic, delicious soy meat.
But in the evening we will see an even greater number of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
My hotel holds a special dinner dedicated to the scaffisque, during which visitors vote determine the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
There is a direct TV air, which shows the presenter in a bow tie surrounded by plates with a cancer.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jurgen, what estimate did you put for the best fish there in your mountains?"
"Yes, Havard, here's our score...."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls from the chair, perhaps, by transvita.
Or maybe just breathing the smell of this fish.
President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will have a difficult start to career.
While the newly elected president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face, and to the mixed expectations of the population of his country.
Road traffic in Mexico City is now in a particularly deplorable condition.
This city is overloaded with transport and at the best time, and from Monday were built steel fences, cutting several key highways to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from entering the Parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will wear a presidential bandage and accept the reins of government of the country.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico has achieved good economic indicators under the administration of Felipe Calderon, which is now vested with its powers, but the country has become immersed in the war with drugs, which has already carried out about 60 years of life.
"My government declares to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence," said Mr. Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the oval cabinet of the White House earlier this week.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Penha Nieto's political career next to the US president developed as governor of his native state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital of the country, opinions about the new head were divided.
Straight man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravvo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents merit the revival of tourism, the development of the resort sector and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached on one of the new highways built by Mr. Penha Nieto, which are strikingly different from the roads with the male and pits that were previously in this place.
The tablets with his name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We associate with him the hopes for real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olver Hernandez, congressman of the state headed by Penha Nieto, an institutional-revolutionary party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed by our country, primarily in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years of uninterrupted stay in power, the PRI party was driven out in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence in the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party puts great hopes on Enrique Pena Nieto.
In addition, he denies the accusations of the content that the opposition put forward to the new president.
He is very straightforward and very devoted to the embodiment of his vision of the future of the country.
This is an excellent statesman, and, above all, a person who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people had a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualkoil, also known as Siudad Neus, is the most striking contrast to the coded streets of Valje de Bravlo.
Hidden under the flyovers of motorways, it in many senses is the suburb of Mexico.
The problems in the municipality are also severe in the city.
Earlier this year, troops were involved in the gangs trading in these areas to calm, and violence against women is particularly acute.
In the wasteland near the vast landfill only in the last two years, several dozen bodies of killed women were found.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico City during the governorship of Mr. Penha Nieto - this significantly exceeds this figure in the infamous city of Siddad-Huares, whose name became common when it comes to the killing of innocent women.
According to the opponents of Mr. Penja Nieto, at best we can say that during his term as governor, he failed to cope with the problem of killing women.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of completely ignoring this problem.
A resident of a concrete house, similar to most of the houses in this dilapidated area, Irina Buenos, hardly restrains tears, showing me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of Mariana in 2010 committed suicide.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her cohabitant.
"When I got to her house, it seemed that her body was washed before that," recalls Ms. Bueniya.
There were signs that she was beaten and the body was already elch.
Mariana's mother recounts this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifixion, on which only one word is drawn: justice.
According to them, this was denied to this family.
"The state officials treated me as an old gossip dissatisfied with the disturber of calm.
They want people to just accept on faith all they say and to care.
But this is wrong, so it is impossible, especially when there are so many violations and deficiencies around," she says.
On Saturday, President Penha Nieto and her will take a difficult responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have affected the crimes related to violence, and the new president promised to make the solution to this problem a priority during his rule.
"I hope that he will be exactly the same president as he was the governor," says Olvera, Congressman from Valle de Broad of the PRI party.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Suddad Neus fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of a bad appeal, claims the charge.
The prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's statements about the poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, increased attention was paid to the stay of Manning in the military prison in Kvantico, Virginia.
The defense demands that the case be closed on the grounds that the conditions of Manning's conclusion were cruel.
A Several U.S. Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the charge tried to prove that private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leakage of classified materials in the history of the United States, did not take advantage of the opportunity to file a complaint against a bad appeal, which, according to him, he had been transferred while in a military prison.
During the interrogation at the pre-trial hearing in Fort Mide, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fain said that the recordings of weekly visits to Manning by the representatives of the prison administration for nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not contain complaints about a bad appeal.
Cross-interesting in the framework of the examination of the request of the defense to terminate the Manning case on the grounds that the conditions of his imprisonment were cruel and in itself was sufficient punishment, was carried out the day after Manning said that being in custody, he intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence expert arrested in June 2010 is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents during the service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks resource did not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During the Friday hearing, the prosecutor Fain and Manning reviewed the reports that were filled after the administration's visits to Manning during his stay in the Kvantico prison, where he was on a strict prison from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, the prison officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When the prosecutor Fain asked for reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he assessed his appeal from the prison administration as "excellent," and the general conditions of imprisonment as "very professionally organized."
The reports did not contain complaints about a bad appeal, despite the fact that Manning was directly asked about the conditions of its content, says Fain.
Manning replied that he expressed his oral concern about these problems and that the administration representatives who visited him were discussing these problems with him and stated that they would be engaged, but did not fix it in writing.
"They recorded "there are no problems" (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't raise this topic in the conversation," Manning says.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about the inappropriate treatment of him in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission, which considered suicidal intentions, which he expressed in writing a few months before.
Manning replied that during that meeting he wanted to get him to take off the regime of "prevention of injury" and soften the conditions of imprisonment.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that the limited regime of imprisonment - to the level lower than the supervision regime in order to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that it's all right with me to abolish the regime of preventing injury... so that the level of my life improves, from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where it was kept for almost two months before being imprisoned at a naval base in Kvantiko, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that the thoughts of suicide had appeared in Kuwait, and that one day he had lost consciousness because of the strong heat.
He explained that psychologically very difficult, when you are not allowed to know how your fate is solved, and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world has shit to Camp Arifzhan, to the size of my prison," Manning said on Thursday.
"I thought I would die in that cell."
Being in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - in total solitude.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, blanket, flip-flops, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move, because he was sleeping or even just lying in the daytime forbidding the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly hit by the light penetrating outside the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned into bed at night, then, according to him, he was awakened and forced to turn on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed an official objection to the mistreatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made during the testimonies on Thursday, that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Kvantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners in the morning check.
Manning said he had no opportunity to cover up with a blanket during the check.
In answer to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he had understood from the order of the guard that he had to throw a blanket that could cover up, but admitted that no one was directly commanding him to throw him.
On Thursday, Manning said that the previous night he was forced to sleep naked because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he could use the rubber bands or flip-flops to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were taken out of the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he had to survive during his imprisonment and will significantly shorten the prison term if Manning is found guilty by a military court that should start examoning his case at the beginning of next year.
The defense said it plans to offer Manning to admit the blame for less serious crimes, and other accusations to challenge as excessive.
The resumption of the hearings is scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was kept in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the maintenance of the arrested with the most strict regime.
Among the accusations brought to Manning, there are support to the enemy, illegal assistance to the publication of data on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national defense, and the abduction of state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all points of the indictment, he may face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the American story of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarett believes that American Mexicans are torn apart between two cultures.
During my recent trip to Mexico City, I walked along the corridor for arriving, approached the border control zone and froze on the spot.
The icon was indicated in two stages: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I was called a Mexican all my life.
This is just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York consider themselves Italians.
Later I stopped at the complex design of the "American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in the homeland of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional names or complex structures.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than native speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and became in turn for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda includes the usual issues of these countries' meetings: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Pena Nieto was willing to talk about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans will now be able to stay in Mexico with the same success, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block like the European Union.
In addition, President Pena Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and executed old offense question.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and under the barrel of rifles forced its leaders to abandon half of their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only worthwhile to any U.S. state figure to speak at least a word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society immediately complain that the Americans incriban on the sovereignty of the neighbors.
And the descendants of Montesium are filled with militantness.
At the same time, the most difficult are the relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States.
Want to talk about offenses?
They are enough.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in this country for themselves, and those for whom there are no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history, someone - father or grandfather - had no opportunity to realize himself in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often they were Mexicans of a certain type - swarthy, uneducated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember it.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Today our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we studied in good schools and settled for good works, but we do not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know what country to consider its own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer them the same.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating lesions and treat us as people of the second grade, as unreal Mexicans.
We are not well spoken in Spanish, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence is due to failures for them.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We would not be behind the silk curtain, finding a fatal life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and it reminds me that there are certain frictions between the real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin - the Mexicans understand their national identity, and the Americans of Mexican origin it is offensive.
She is a US citizen and believes that it belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintance Americans of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also love Bruce Springstin.
By get the best of the two worlds, you inevitably lose your root.
In Mexico we are Americans.
And in the United States we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relations are not sufficiently confused, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Americans of Mexican origin to work as ambassadors of Mexico and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit, and could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing will come out.
Too much resentment in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the riot of corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country so beautiful.
Sorry, but deal with it yourself, amilgos.
And this is true.
If some Mexicans still can't forgive the United States how they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican origin are still in resentment for how recently in Mexico treated their relatives.
Yes, that's it.
Perhaps we have more in common than it seemed to me.
Old battles in the new Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas may become a fragile foundation for further peace
Is there a long-term peace between the Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
There are common, meaningless disputes about who the first started; many buildings have been turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians have been killed, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip have fallen in the vicinity of the capital of Israel, Tel Aviv and the sacred city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians are unhinged in their eternal conflict, changes have come to the Middle East.
This can be treated differently, but the events of the "Arab Spring" have been erected in a rebellious storm of established realities, and the Palestinians and Israelis have not managed to stay away from the wits that shocked the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons that give hope to get out of this deadly deadlock.
The war without victories
At first glance, the current situation does not give reason for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, the agreement on which was signed on November 21, the clashes that took place this week only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement, who came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will say that they have forced Israel to retreat despite their losses.
Despite the fact that some leaders of the group were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents are blocked in one of the most densely populated and problematic corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining popularity in the West Bank - another Palestinian territory controlled by the currently more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion that the time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new influential and rich friends.
The reviving regional leader of Turkey, who was once the closest ally of Israel among Muslim countries, supported Hamas; its example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most rapidly developing states of the Persian Gulf.
The cerevents of Hamas declare the creation of an Islamist crescent around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, in which the paramilitary group of Hezbollah rule, to Syria, in which increasingly the Islamic rebels are about to overthrow Bashar al-Assad's power, and then to Jordan, where the king's authorities are threatened by the allies of Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where under President Mohammed Mursi the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood has strengthened.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay much attention to the support of Hamas.
The Muslim brothers, on the contrary, are the organization, in many ways similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic arrangements, Hamas can become a significant player whose voice will not be able to stifle even Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the "hard" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In the military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli anti-missile system Iron Dome justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the missiles launched by Hamas.
Citizens of Israel can sleep quietly, at least for some time.
As for diplomacy, the U.S. remained loyal to its unchanging position; many European countries also blamed the beginning of the last round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially in the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, which largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, approximately 30 Israelis have been killed by missiles fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide terrorists, partly at the expense of the wall that enters the West Bank of the Jordan River - a significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international legislation.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the January 22 elections - united with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What is the point of indulging in the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If they give all power in the West Bank, will they not start launching missiles from there towards Israel, as do their fellows in the Gaza Strip do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and firmly suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
Perhaps the supporters of the "hard" line will win; but their calculations may be refuted by the Arab spring.
While the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not feel the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defense part of Israel's budget is greater than all its Arab neighbors, combined.
The unleashing of war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help the Arab governments to strengthen their own economy.
The Pragueism of the President of Egypt, Mursi, who together with Barack Obama worked on a ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel, to no less, should take into account the long-term consequences of its policy.
As democratic changes in the Arab countries, the deprivation of the right to self-determination of Palestinians is a time bomb that will sooner or later explode in Israel's occupied territories, like a bus blown up in Tel Aviv this week.
Repressions already undermine the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have to pay the growing dissatisfaction of the international community.
Both sides need an external impulse
There is only a decision that is steadlessly called by sound representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two states and concessions to Israel territories in exchange for security.
There is hope that not too impressive in the short term - the hope that the ceasefire will allow other countries to more effectively influence the parties of the conflict.
Egypt, which has long decided to block the supply of weapons to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have more than ever a favorable position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah's movements.
This would make it more for the establishment of a Palestinian state than the upcoming vote in the United Nations, the result of which could be the recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama must also play his role in seating Israel at the negotiating table.
During his first term, he did not present his own plan of peaceful settlement.
After returning to the White House, he still demonstrates his reluctance to connect to the solution of this problem.
This is a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia has entered into force the law on a unified package for cigarettes.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and the images of body parts affected by diseases are contrastingly on dull green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice Australian law on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco came into force, replacing logos and color design of different brands of the same box of duly olive color with terrible pictures of body parts affected by disease and images of children whose health is undermined by smoking of their parents.
In addition to different pictures and inscriptions warning about the harm of smoking, the only difference between packs introduced mandatory from this Saturday - the names of brands that are printed in the same small font.
These are the most severe conditions in the world for the registration of tobacco packaging.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the purpose of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving this harmful habit of fashion status.
Such a decision was based on the results of studies showing that people who did not smoke up to 26 years, in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.
"It is obvious that even at the youngest age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through packaging," explains the Minister of Health Tanya Plibersec, referring to the studies showing that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the world's smallest share of smokers, so these changes will not particularly affect the profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of such measures is already considered by other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market, which will sell cheap and affordable cigarettes.
"This law will lead to serious consequences other than those that were conceived by its initiators," said Scott McIntayre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to business growth.
Sandra Ha from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that the demand for portigars and silicone cases that hide unpleasant pictures on the package, has grown rapidly (practically from scratch) since two months ago such companies as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the high court of Australia, where they tried to appeal this law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about six thousand products to wholesale enterprises and expects a new party.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are aimed at is a potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures.
After the adoption of a number of laws in Australia, made illegal TV advertising cigarettes and support them sports events, as well as prohibiting sellers to exhibit cigarettes in a prominent place, advertising tobacco products moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from placing ads on the network, but it cannot limit foreign websites.
"If you sell tobacco products and you have only this small loophole, the idea to promote your goods on the Internet seems extremely tempting to you," explains Beka Freeman, exploring public health issues at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of reviews of trademarks written on behalf of allegedly ordinary users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is it really a business of ordinary citizen who loves cigarettes so much Marlboro that did not regret the strength and time and made a video, or is behind it advertising company?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more busy adapting to the new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry even went to measures such as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states claim within the framework of the World Trade Organization, stating that trade has been subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that the trade relations between all these countries and Australia are very insignificant.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersec, the government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar laws on packaging.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory placement of photos warning of the dangers of smoking.
Now this rule is adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstratively not guilty of innovations.
These pictures do not hurt me.
I just don't pay attention.
"You can take out a cigarette and hide a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Hague, who buys cigarettes with a photo of a tumor of the oral cavity on a pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me throw - this is my little daughter.
James Yeu, the head of the King of the Pack tobacco shop in the center of Sydney, claims that the same packaging has complicated the task of placing goods on shelves
"Previously, I've been going to unload a new party for an hour, and now it's four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would say then: what to do, okay, it's over, shut the shop," he says, throwing his hands upwards.
To miss electronic networks and permanent connections in the world is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving Day I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our aircraft found mechanical problems and it was replaced by another aircraft, which we waited.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of the race.
I will not deceive you.
Half a year at the airport waiting for the flight - it is really boring, and here will not help much neither books, magazines, nor iPhone, nor even duty-free shops.
However, in recent years, more and more scientists and specialists in children's development are expressed in favor of the race.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to miss is not so bad.
This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the advantages of the race pass by us.
Maybe we need to strive for a lot of fed?
Yes.
And at the same time there is no.
We're still back to this.
Previously, like many, I thought that the bessiege was an invention of relatively recent times, when people had more free time.
This is not true, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, author of the book "Boredom: Aly Live History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, the race can boast of a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls in Pompeii found Latin inscriptions about the race, dating from the first eye.
At the same time, the question of how we understand the problem remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Istodd, Adjunct Professor of the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of the race has often changed.
Having studied the materials of research on this topic and asked the target group of 100 people, Professor Isvud and his colleagues came to the following definition: the reason is when people "want, but can't do what would bring them satisfaction."
The difference between bored and apathy, he says, is that a bored person does not do something that he would like to do.
When apathy, I do not want to do anything.
The main thing in the experienced cobud, he says, is "violation of attention and associated deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is going slowly."
According to the description of the race may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Istud asserts that despite the possible connection between these states, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and circumstances, and people who are experiencing depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes it seems to us that we are bored when it is really difficult for us to focus on something.
In their research "Unemployed Mind: Determination of Bucks from the Point of Attention" published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Isvud and his colleagues refer to the previous experiment, the participants of which listened to the recording of the voice reading of the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds of the TV program, which was not related to the case, included in the next room, others heard the same sounds at low volume, so they could hardly be disastled, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without a stranger's soundtrack.
Those participants who heard a low-end TV, noted that they were bored, more often than others - it was difficult for them to focus, but they did not know the reason and attributed it to bored.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interruption of attention can cause a dull, says Mark J. Fenska, Adjunct Professor of Neurology at the University of Gvelfa, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, looking into the flow of products on the conveyor in finding a marriage, distracting music can help avoiding the race."
It is believed, he continues, that when people begin to sway on a chair or draw scribbles on a sheet of paper, they do it from a bessuck, but now we know that in fact such actions just help not to relax physically.
"The study showed that children who do not forbid to squeege and turn, learn better and remember more information than children, from whom they demand to sit quietly," - says Professor Fensk.
In some moments, we all have a buznead: when the flight delay (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people demonstrate different degrees of inclination to be insed.
In the 1980s, for the measurement of such individual features, the researchers developed a special "cash of inclination to bep."
To determine the assessment on such a scale, questions and statements are used, for example, "Many of what I have to do, monotonously and monotonously" or "I'm too much interested, so there is nothing to do with."
With the help of such questionnologists, researchers have determined that boys are bored more often by girls, - says Stephen Vodanovic, Professor of Psychology at the University of Western Florida, especially in the presence of various external irritants.
However, in general, teenagers often miss.
In 1991, Rid Larson, professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he communicated with the help of a pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32% of teenagers said that they were bored at school and during their homework, and 23% said they were bored outside the school.
At the same time, only 3% of parents noted that they are bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on how such data about the race now is, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "the age of adolescence has a peak of the tendency to be insupidious," mainly because children and teenagers do not allow to fully decide what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: is it useful for the race?
Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations it, as research shows, can push people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risk gambling or abuse of certain substances in attempts to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the relationship between the race and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who devoted to the study of this problem for more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us that we should do something else; this is a blot," says Gary Markus, Professor of Psychology at the New York University.
However, this very brain does not always know what is better to do.
If you're bored and you'll direct this energy to play guitar or culinary experiences, you'll make yourself better.
However, if you watch TV, you will be better only for a while, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child misses and you give him an iPad, he will stop bored, but he will not learn to fight bored on his own or in any other way to manage his time and employment, - says Professor Fenska.
"And such skills of independent regulation are involved in a variety of situations," he says.
Your child learns not only to take up something on his own, he also learns self-control in general.
I don't think the race needs to be sededed somehow.
However, it is not worth considering it something bad either.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of actions and technologies.
Professor Istud agrees with this.
"We see this so that we need to experience a race more often, with the fact that the race is a very unpleasant, insensible desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people try to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
"In the modern world we are accustomed to the constant excessive stimulation of the senses," he says, "And when silence comes, we are lost and we do not know what to do."
So far, it is unclear how the new law on legalization of marijuana in Colorado will be applied
Anthony Olosco, a nineteen-year-old football team player and a student of a public college in the southeast of Colorado, was accused of committing a criminal crime that would soon be completely legal throughout the state: the storage of a small portion of marijuana and a tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Oxo says that one day in September he and his friends were in Lamar and drove in a car on a preria near the Kansas border when they were stopped by the police.
After the police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco came to court for possession of drugs and possession of a device for the use of drugs - minor offenses, for each of which is due to a fine of $ 100 - and the date of the trial is appointed.
"We are treated as criminals," says Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that lasts for several weeks after Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small litigations depends not so much on the law as on the place of consideration.
Accusations in minor offenses related to marijuana are already being filmed in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which took a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped accusing people aged 21 and older for storing small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as a couple of weeks the law comes into force.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colorado, the accusers decided to consider the existing cases related to marijuana, and still hold accountable for the possession of this drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West, they vote to prevent the emergence of new, licensed by the state of marijuana stores.
"All this is developing so rapidly that I don't even know what to expect next," says Daniel J. Oouts, police chief in the town of Aurora in the east of Denver.
Representatives of the controlling bodies in the state of Washington are also puzzled to scratch their heads.
They will have to form rules to determine the procedure for licensing, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done before December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado is good or bad, ahead of most other states in resolving marijuana use, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado, a more ordered market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Council for Regulation of Production and Sales of Alcoholic Products in Washington.
But now no one can do more, says Mr. Smith than to propose some proposals and hope that it will work.
"We don't have a real precedent that we could navigate," he says.
The Washington State Draft, called I-502, will come into force on December 6 and will inject the state into uncertainty for a whole year, when the system of state licensing is not yet available, and the right to own marijuana has already been legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be solved during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state's order on "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on trading it at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It will be difficult to place licensed marijuana trading companies in the city, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly created marijuana Legalization Research Group.
On November 21, the police chief of the Aurora police sent an e-mail to his subordinates that the city prosecutor's office will no longer hold persons who reached the age of 21 to justice for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police stops extinguating people in these violations "starting from this moment."
Police Chief Outs said that the police will monitor the observance of the rules in the city regulating the activities of marijuana for medical purposes and will persecute illegal drug dealers and distributors.
The Wald County Prosecutor in the North Colorado, Ken Buck, presents a more stringent approach to this issue.
After the voting on the draft law, he said that the Prosecutor's Office will continue to hold liable for marijuana ownership, mainly in order to encourage the persons to undergo treatment.
At the moment, 119 persons have been charged with keeping two or less marijuana ounces, although many of them are also accused of other violations.
"The obligation of our institution is to be persecuted for actions that are considered criminal at the time of their commission," Buck said in his statement.
The reaction was ambiguous even in places such as the village district of Mesa, where the voting participants rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The Grand Janksh, the largest city in the district, no longer brings to justice adults for owning a small amount of drugs.
District prosecutor Pith Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to withdraw charges for already open cases related to the storage of marijuana.
"I believe that ensuring compliance with the law until it changes - our direct duty," he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of the citizens of Colorado, who participated in the voting, supported this decision, the inclusion of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be simple.
And the contradictory reaction of residents in different parts of the state has exposed the ambiguity of the attitude of the local authorities to the state experiment with marijuana.
"The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this regard," explains Sean McAllister, a denver lawyer representing the interests of convicted persons for keeping marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for Reforming marijuana laws.
"They have been persecuting people for so long that they can't really accept that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington - the first states in which a small number of marijuanas are treated as well as alcohol - is destined to become an experimental field in the country to check the idea of legalization of drugs.
Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are cautially waiting for instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Supporters of legalization of marijuana hope that the Justice Department will give way in this regard.
Despite several resonanced arrests of merchants and patients who used marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases gave goodness to trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Drug Control Bureau are unlikely to break into houses to confiscate a small package of marijuana, but they will hardly close their eyes to the state-regulated stores of recreational marijuana, which are allowed under the new law, says Kevin A. Sabet, former adviser to combat drugs in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana stores, which could not have opened earlier than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, proposed a six-month ban on marijuana trading, which seems to be approved next week.
"We do not want to be in such a position that we will issue a license to someone, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," - says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local voting and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved issues.
Petronella Wayett: I was survived from Oxford for being a conservative.
Persecuting university students for their views began not today.
As far as I remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and elder brother studied in Oxford and described him as the world's best educational institution, a modern analogue of the ancient symposium, laying two foundations of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, two weeks of studying at the Faculty of the University of Wuster College of Oxford at the end of the eighties, I collected my bags and left, which was the first real scandal in my life.
My father didn't stand and wept.
The friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I had abandoned the college because I didn't like my classmates sex in the next room.
Writer E. Normann Wilson joked that I had gone because I had to drink from gravel cups.
In fact, everything was not so funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was systematically poisoned and intimidated.
Not at all because of my rather unusual name or that I was studying in a private school.
I was poisoned for only one reason, and in this famous cradle of enlightenment it looked like a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Wudro Wyett, was a well-known adviser Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of conservatives.
You ask, why remember it now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students, adhering to the center-right views, is subjected to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as the one granted to the disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the College of the College Christie in Cambridge claim that they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and make themselves undesired guests" because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the College Equal Rights Committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation only aggravated the recently released BBC 2 documentary about politics in the student environment "Country of miracles: young, smart and right," in which conservatives were presented by eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cook, former president of the Conservative Association of Oxford University, who rides in the Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver-casher.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are doing "a scapegoat due to an increase in the fee for studies."
Luke Black, 20 years old, vice-president of the Association of Conservatives of the University of Nottingham, said in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers that "in the university environment there is an increase in the bias towards left-wing views.
People who do not even know us consider us arrogant and impunity riotous children of wealthy parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the Faculty of History of the College of Christie Corps, in which the request for strengthening protection, calls such an atmosphere "unfuted," and Stephanie Cerill, 19 years old, the new president of the Conservatives Association of Oxford University, says that the attitude of the members of the student club to the bearers of the center-right views has significantly worsened.
"This poses a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and just for the normal life of the club members," she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford I was not just a minority, I was alone.
I entered there in September 1986, a shy and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford was feverish from hatred towards the conservative party.
A year earlier, the university with a vote deprived former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorable degree due to the reduction of budgetary allocations for higher education.
In such an atmosphere it would be uncomfortable even to the Stalinists.
In the first days of the first-year student, when students get acquainted with each other and teachers, I first felt what was waiting for me ahead.
I did not know yet that teachers not only looked through the fingers at the persecution of conservative students, but also with pleasure took part in it.
Political issues - the strike of miners, privatization and disagreement of the government to apply sanctions against the government of apartheid in South Africa - penetrated through the walls of the audience covered with wooden panels.
At my first seminar I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyett," said Harry Pitt, now late, "Please transfer the first paragraph."
The text was given to me with difficulty, I stumbled.
Harry Pitt was a very illogical man with a face like a cake.
"Tatchers don't teach French or don't just have enough brains?" he asked.
Other students seded.
I had tears before my eyes.
"I have a good idea to take a few of the French lessons in your free time, if you are not, of course, very busy, revolving in society," Pitt said.
I returned to my room completely unhappy.
That evening I was sitting alone at college; then someone patted me on my shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the Faculty of English, who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Association of University.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
Everyone who is suspected of sympathy for conservatives will be mocked.
It's not easy for me, and in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so you will be harder.
Most freshmen-conservatives pretend to be laborers."
Later, in the local pub, I tried cowardly to hypocrisy.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick failed.
The first-year student of the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who studied in Iton himself, said: "You are the daughter of fascist pigs.
You're infectious."
Other students picked up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
"They're beating each other, right?"
I felt like homosexuals must have felt like they had to be abolition of criminal prosecution in the sixties.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or would I have to meet like-minded people only under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a laborer and hide my real beliefs?
The three years I had to appear to be hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
Norman Stone, professor of modern history, was the only teacher in my college who did not hide his conservative views.
He was hated not only for belonging to conservatives, but also for being adviser to Thatcher on foreign policy issues and one of her speakers.
He practically did not appear in college.
He despised him for provinciality, pettyness and commitment to the Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997 he took a professorial position at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I began to go to Oxford from my parent's home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased capital friends.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the forties, there were any political views.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said complainingly.
"There's no such thing, but not in the city of dormant spires..."
Even my communist friends have always behaved flawlessly."
His wet eyes were clouded.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You will break my heart if you throw a university."
I was weary constant trips to London and my emotional protection weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, did not withstand pressure and gave up his beliefs.
Next week, during the seminar, when another history teacher seriously called me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In my heart, burning with shame, I confessed that "my brainwashing my parents," and called them "old fools."
The respite was not long.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was destined to score my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Murdock.
My door was locked.
I did not come out, and after five minutes my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I gathered my suitcase and sat down on the first train to London.
I have not returned.
You can call me a cry and a rag.
But in eighteen years, no one should become the object of such anger and intimidities in the educational institution.
The sadr is that it was Oxford, which not only released fourteen Prime Ministers of Tori, but to this day hides behind the undeserved reputation of the university, which appreciates equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance"
About the exhibition "Valentino: Master of sewing," which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abasal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemitsa and other famous clients of the Italian designer
The Somerset House, former residence of the English Queen Elizabeth I, is the only place in the British capital worthy to host an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of "Valentino: Master of sewing," a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 dresses of high fashion, created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I sed for this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "the "signor" of Garavani, but it could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, opened until March 3, abound personal letters and photographs signed by the most notable aristocrats, from Princess Salima Agha-Han to Lord Snowdon, including Mari-Shan, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of its social upliftment: from a modest tailor from the city of Voger in northern Italy to the idol of the international "elite."
To be in love with the royal court - that's not bad.
"They don't even extinguish their cigarettes about your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful stars of pop music do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemica.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unrepable owner and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We liked everyone to come in his chalets in Gstaad," explains the former wife of "Haini" Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Anjelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance.
And in spite of that, he is a star.
Valeria Matza, representing Valentino
The Argentine model of Valery Matza recalls the charismatic fashion designer.
One day we went to dinner for him home, it was after the fashion show in Spain in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy - Junior.
Valentino's style was manifested in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in her decoration, in food, in music.
"Each of the guests Valentino made you feel important and loved," recalls the "top model," whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He's never out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art," she concludes.
Parade of pedigree
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House was turned into a glamorous podium of sixty meters in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor occupies the place of models and should defile on the podium, contemplating "viewers" of dream, who glide with masterpieces from Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for his wedding with the Aristotelite, who used the costume of the Fessi, which was used by the costume of the "Snace," which was used by the costume of the Shes.
In this public of the models shine names such as Sibyl Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn undxtas, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg.
Nati Abaskal and the fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino - as the first love, "cannot forget."
I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirt, "residential" and jacket from the collection of autumn-winter 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he made to me," says Nati Abaskall, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they " approach" to his face.
Proportions are ideal.
Princess and fashion legislator Patricia della Dzhovampaola d'Arenberg also can not forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have age and reason to put on one of his evening toilets...
Finally came that hour in the late 90s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear it on the feast in the house of my cousin, Prince Eduard de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with ruffles, a "corsage" in a fold and a cut strapless.
"It was a dream that became a reality," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her festive dresses from the fashion designer with "maximum caution... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a collection of memories accompanying him."
"King" of fashion
The great finale of the exhibition in Somerset House - Marie-Shantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the fashion designer of his sewing) to make this outfit of silk color ivory with pearl inlay, twelve views of various laces and a helmet of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is a strong fashion end of the XX century, "the return of clients from the highest world."
The elite intoxicated for many years is the "life style" of the elite, now Valentino himself is her best representative.
The great cross cavalryman (sign of the highest rank in Italy), the Cavalry of Labour, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Literature, awarded the Order of Legion of Honor, Garavani collected as much honor as any of the spouses of his clients.
"Always my attention attracted his refine, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance," recalls d'Arenberg.
Last time I saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He sat at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Rybe, my big friend.
"He was uncorruly, time doesn't exist for him."
If it says the princess...
The heaviest profession in the world: miners with Kavakh-Izhn
For four euros Indonesian miners risk life and health, dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of the volcano on steep stony trails
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them, Anto Vijayia, one of 400 miners who make a living for the prey of sulfur in the volcano Kavyah-Ijen, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas rising from the depths of the Earth, it stops when in contact with the air.
The pile of huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, puts the baskets on his shoulders and carries them up on a bursting stony road.
To the top of the volcano, whose height is 2.386 meters, only 250 meters, but exhausted loaders need more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle step, with difficulty holding balance and carefully looking for the road, so as not to fall from the cliff.
They know that one wrong step can cost them life, as it happened to one tourist from France, which broke a few years ago from the cliffs of Cavah-Ijena.
Miners with Kavyh-Igena earn 5 euro cents per kilogram of sulfur, which is extracted
Once up, they paved themselves the road between tourists who photograph them, as if they were monkeys from the circus and tired of having heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales that the mining company has placed a little higher, at an altitude of 1.850 meters.
We are talking about PT Candi Nghimbi, an enterprise that has operated since 1960 this volcano and is better not to say its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulfur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemical production, because this mineral is common in everyday life and used for making matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar.
"Since the norm is to carry 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each walker," explains Anto, who usually performs three daily carrying.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems a miserable for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than he would earn in the field.
"The fee for miners is very high by local standards, where the collection of coffee is paid by 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and average monthly earnings are equal to two million rupees (167 euros) ," - explains the loader, who used to work as a stone mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banjuvangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason, which in Indonesia is as crushing as sulfur: "I married a girl with Bali, where some Hindus, and brought her to Java, to take Islam."
In Anto asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughing, and his eyes are peeled because of toxic gases
In his 27 years, Anto spent three years, risking himself in the Caves-Igene, whose sedage has already begun to affect it despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughing, and his eyes are peeled because of the toxic gases that emit the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I'm working for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
The punished life, this nice and smart young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or porter at the hotel, but instead he performs the work of the mullah.
Delay is a dirty wooden hut with other porters, it rises every day at two o'clock in the morning, because sulcer does not cease to flow at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns into blue and shines among the darkness.
By challenging the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, illuminating the road with a small lantern, connected to his helmet, which he himself bought with his money.
About 400 porters drag baskets with gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite high profits, the mining company did not mechanized sulfur production to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work on their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not even receive parts of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) collection for photography, which, along with the entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this reserve charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mules people.
"This work for cattle, not for people," Badrusin, said, a chunky porter of 42 years, who spent three decades in Cavah-Ijena, since he left the college.
Able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will endure the work "as much as he can," because he needs money for the education of his three children aged 18 to 10 years.
I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano is my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and burns its eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the dense pillars of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains of their serious diseases... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing, arthrosis, knee pain and ulcers on the shoulders, which were deformed under the weight of the basket.
Balancing the backrest basket, Unainic can now only raise 50 kilograms in its 53 years.
Every day he and his comrades take 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the thickets.
"I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening his mouth, which lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30 years old, also works as a carrier of sulfur.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuate from generation to generation one of the heaviest activities in the world: what human mules do with Kavakh-Ijena.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeers accuse career, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriot's husband, you are my wife a patriot, we will fulfill our civil duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising of mint cakes, but despite this - or perhaps thanks to this - this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Let's put a bao (bun) in the stove" to laugh at the fertility level in Singapore.
The advertising agency, which made this video, BBH, cheers the hope that with the help of advertising they will be able to draw attention to this problem in entertainment form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill "his national duty."
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our kind, so we felt that this is the topic we should touch.
We knew that the government was trying to do much, such as the launch of spirits with pheromones or to organize fast dating parties (blitz dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought why not make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely to compose rap?
1,2 children
Who does not perceive it so light-mindedly, so it is the government of Singapore.
It spends 1.300 USD per year on politics to encourage citizens to give birth to more children.
The state package for couples and parents provides up to $ 15,000 for a child, extends maternity leave and provides tax incentives.
But all this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state-city in Southeast Asia, also known for its leadership and its strict public control.
The fertility rate in Singapore, according to its national administration for population, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - which is known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976.
So why do Singaporeers do not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the marital couple policy and families of the National Administration for Population, says that the reason for this "improved education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"This allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life's goals and priorities, in addition to wedding and family creation," she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the growth of the number of bachelors and lag for marriages and the birth of children, resulting in lower fertility in Singapore.
Meanwhile, the immigration policy, which aims to sharply increase immigration to confront the reduction of the population, causes indignation among the local population.
Singapore has websites where the barely concealed xenophobia is thriving against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low salaries and reluctance to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that last year the ruling party of Singapore has received the worst result in elections since independence.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility has a well-known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical expenses and immigration policies, Singapore's example also begins to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts not to build so much small housing.
For example, this began to affect the real estate sector.
The city development management has passed to the control of the number of small apartments known as the "swt box," which can be built in certain areas of the city.
This apartment of 46 square meters is very well sold.
However, there is an opinion that they can contribute to a idle way of life and deprive the incentives of developers who want to build a large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of the house-building company EL Developers, says that their "shoes" are sold much faster than more spacious specimens.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold out for a few days, even weeks, faster than apartments of larger size.
As a result, our cash revenues are increasing.
However, he admits that the new norms give clearer guidelines for developers who used to put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too strained
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules can be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to the Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems that they will not have a special effect.
"People are very overstated, housing is expensive, as well as education, and because of this, many people postpone it," - says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
"But it is important for me to have my own money and time," another young man says for 20 years.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and housing prices and education as a reason that prevent them from making children.
So, no matter how the government tries to encourage its citizens to give birth to children, as for childbirth, the last word remains for the Singaporeans.
Personal offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is a property of private or "private life, which has the right to protect against any intervention."
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers that are being exposed to online discussions with situations that would certainly not be shared outside the Internet?
elPeri'dico interviewed five children from ten to 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine," in the personal plane, and "a password and the user's name," when they applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't have uploaded to the post," says Jorge, ten-year-old, when trying to explain the value of personal websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been in the domain for two years.
"They're very secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world," he says.
On FB I download beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
Also I am having fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who behaves stupidly," he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish indecent photos of nude people, crimes or write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he knows 35 friends who have in FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother is aware, she has a password for one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if I'm answering, I'm only downloading them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or with my friends in a quickly way," he points out.
Without thinking, he answers that he would never accept a request from an unfamiliar person.
Would not be reckoned with someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter recognizes that he does not know 20 people added to his friends list.
"It doesn't frighten me because we have something in common, music, for example," he points out.
According to the boy, no one was rubbed in trust and did not ask for his home address or phone number.
"If I am being pressed or demanded, I will just remove them from my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to the experience of what is known today as cyber-bobbing.
One acquaintance of my girlfriend blackmailed on the social network.
He was threatened and extorted money.
"He didn't know who it was," he assures.
The victim, according to José, did not delete the account.
"Only included confidentiality."
Then it explains the sequence of steps to configure the account in a secure way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would download photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confuseous situations.
Yes, I would do it if a person doesn't like me or if I want it.
"Although I know it's cyber-blobbing," he confirms.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a specialist in education and training, believes that in order to send children and adolescents, you need to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet appeared as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites the rules of the game have changed," she notes.
Porras points out that academician Mark Prenski, master of pedagogy from Yale University and the author of the work of Digital Aborigines and immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital aborigines are they, children and young people who were born in the era of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning," she says.
It explains that this topic is difficult, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion that can or cannot be distributed, published or spoken, at age, when maturity is not enough for it."
"It is also important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show what is privacy for children and teenagers - to ask questions that make them think.
"It's useless to say that they don't do it," she adds.
Then Porace lists some options: there are things you would not tell the stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like to have published a photo like you've been published about your friend?
Do you know that others are publishing about you?
When you sign photos from parties, do you ask other people to celebrate them?
And one more thing, do everyone need to know what you are doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them understand that they should behave online just as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"At the Internet a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, as well as in social networks," she says.
vigilance
Estouardo Guardia, university teacher, professor of primary education and education consultant, explains the need for the heads of families to faithfully read the policies of social networks.
Understanding each of the items, they have good grounds for talking to children about the prerequisites for opening an online account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published," he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson "do not speak to strangers."
UNASUR summit ends without the Lim Declaration
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lim Declaration, announced earlier and theoretically signed by the family by mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI regular meeting of the heads of states and governments of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration pointed out on the main page that it will be transferred after closing, but then confirmed that at some point it will be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
When asked about the text, they pointed out that the contents were stated by President Peru, Olyanta Umal, during brief press statements.
The access of journalists to the information about the Summit was all the time limited.
During the day it was only broadcast, in the press room, the video of the presidential assembly without sound with the message "closed sitting, sound is prohibited."
A little information that was circulated among reporters was handed over to the press secretaries of some UNASUR governments present at the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of the Presidents participating, which caused dissatisfaction of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the presidential administration of Peru sent an electronic message to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is a statement of Umal, rather than the official document that the summit ended.
Last October, Peru received the III Summit of South American and Arab countries (ASPA), and that time, despite the fact that this insistently demanded the press, was also not distributed the so-called Lim Declaration, which was previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
During both international meetings the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure the system of programs for all journalists, but to limit the receipt of information as much as possible.
The summit also ended with a joint decision of Chile and Peru to adopt a verdict of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between both countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olyanta Umal, and Chile, Sebastian Pinera, gathered at the regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the International Court's decision, which will begin hearing of both parties" statements on Monday in The Hague, as part of the accusation that Lima brought against Santiago.
"We will comply with and implement the decision, which will explain the differences that we are currently presenting in this international court," Umala said next to his Chilean colleague.
"Chili was, is and will be a country respecting international law, peaceful resolution of disagreements, pacts and international tribunals," said Pinera, and greeted Umal's hand against the background of the flags of these two countries.
The two presidents' statement that they would obey the International Court of Justice occurred immediately after Columbia protested this week by the Bogoth Pact, according to which she recognized the submission to the verdicts of this international court after the decision on the sea borders with Nicaragua, which she considered erroneous.
The summit took place in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roussef; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR was suspended since 2011 after the impeachment of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Olyanta Umal, was responsible for opening discussions in the morning and closing the summit, a little later than noon in Lim time.
The Head of State read the final document, which said that 16 agreements were adopted and directions of action on 31 projects among South American countries were approved, the amount of the estimated investment amounted to 17 billion dollars.
Among the adopted agreements, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "the important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the residence agreement."
He said that actions are being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against the uncertainty of citizens and against organized transnational crime, actions to increase the availability of medicines, inexpensive Internet access in all parts of South America and taking into account the aggregate and effective risks of natural disasters."
As Europe is in crisis, "the economic union (Latin America) should not have a triumphal basis, but should serve to expand our production base and foresee a better future for our cities," Umala added.
"We decided to give privileges to a group of 31 significant projects that will improve the connection of spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes," the Peruvian president said in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five belong to Peru, and are limited by transverse axes in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at greater ties with Ecuador, but he has not provided more details.
The final document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve as its re-joining to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace would be united, and had good relations between neighbors, was another topic underline at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before taking part in a regional meeting that he hopes to meet his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to conduct a good conversation on a naval dispute as a result of the verdict of the international court contested by Bogota.
"After tomorrow (Saturday), perhaps to meet with President Daniel Ortego," said Santos.
"We will review all these paths, they do not exclude mutually, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope I can tell him that we will cope with this as possible civilized and respectful way," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they have the presence of the new president of this country, Enrique Pena Nieto.
Also within the framework of the summit, the defense ministers of the bloc met in advance to approve the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen the dialogue and unanimity on the issue of protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form the UNASUR, although the participation of the latter is suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe in the issue of citizenship integration": Rafael Correa
President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the establishment of common citizenship is the goal in which "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told the State Television of Peru that Europeans "killed each other during the Second World War" and in other clashes, "they are now almost one country."
He defended, in this context, the project of establishing South American citizenship, which is approved by the participating countries of UNASUR.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as it already happens with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president has also proved to be a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAG) under the precondition for the reduction of the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and the adoption of those who signed the San Jose Pact on human rights.
Those who give lectures never assume any obligations, and we, South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights is located in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said, hinting at the political asylum given by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he does not regret this decision, because he did not betray his principles with him, but respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that at one time "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be followed."
He also criticized the Swedish justice for the request to enter its territory for interrogation of the alleged sexual crime, while "the Swedish legislation considers it possible to implement it through a video conference that could be made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I haven't talked to him since he arrived in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious," the head of state said.
What is really there is a danger of deteriorating his physical and mental health due to imprisonment in a small space without the possibility of doing air exercises.
"This affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem granted to Assange from June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the provision of inviolability, which will allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judiciary and stressed that there were negotiations in London on finding a solution to the problem of imposing the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use the word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judiciary, because lawyer Assange, Baltasar Garson, conducts a number of processes in various European courts," he said.
He expressed the opinion that "if the UK will provide a guarantee of inviolability tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as it perfectly allows her legislation and how she has already done in other cases, interrogate the senior Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogate him by Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to express himself as a defender of freedom of press and stressed that he did not tolerate "mediaty, dishonesty and lies that distort freedom of expression."
"The main enemies of freedom of press are not corrupt villains-politics, but bad journalists supporting profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect, he was pleased that neither these journalists, "ne of the bankers, nor bourgeom countries do not dominate Ecuador," and added that, being re-elected, "deaf the revolution to continue development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in the UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the mask of legality," because in reality "this has destroyed the legality of the Paraguay democracy."
In addition, the Ecuadorian president considered, in addition, the desire of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the sea borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of Hague, which turned out to be in favor of Nicaraguan sea sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not observed.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
It is necessary to process them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed the hope for a good completion of the dispute about the sea borders that lead in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that "it is correct for Latin America to apply to international authorities if the two countries undertake to make a decision, no matter how difficult it may be."
As for the possibility of acting as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third term in a row, he pointed out that he is considering this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult."
Correa assured that if he loses in the elections in February 2013, he will leave the public life.
In personal terms, I have never been interested in the authorities, but in such unfair situations as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political authorities.
"My political movement considered that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so we have to admit this responsibility," he said.
In case of victory, this would be my last term in office of president, and then we get out of public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
"This is the decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he had gone for a treatment that had already been planned, routine, and that he is expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean aggravation of President Chavez's health condition," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state took part in the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS's death today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was announced that his AIDS analysis had a positive result.
"I'd be stunned," he recalls that difficult moment, despite the whole of the doctor's bet.
The young man hid it from his family.
Having decided to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And his efforts were justified - he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" patients of the hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he came in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He lives with a diagnosis of "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 90s it would be difficult to believe - too little then there were treatment options, too little knew about the disease, too biased treated the sick.
Thus, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, in those days to have AIDS was a verdict.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it, without deteriorating the quality of life.
However, without knowing about their disease, so far many people come when the virus has already inflicted damage, "fed" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least after the first cases, "a great achievement at the moment is that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the common population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV-department, Haime Andrade Vilyanueva, citing the fact that this information was confirmed in April in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infectionist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Vilyanueva, explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a verdict, but the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of lesions of the immune system in patients at the beginning of diagnosis, with better life expectancy in those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years of death, when the CD is reported.
Simply put, the above means that the one who is diagnosed with HIV-positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "supporting control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6.668 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (YONAIDS's annual report), it is also true that since the arrival of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died.
Only in Khalisco 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been registered by May this year; nevertheless, it is stated that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still fatal outcomes?
- Personally, it seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment.
So I imagine it, so things are in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they do not know about their infected condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He cited crushing data: "Nine of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality, so it is to carry out diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide trials for mass detection, for all people who will ask for it."
In their proposal, experts and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Khalisco (COESIDA) agree, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who turned to check in a private laboratory, encouraged only by the fact that it did it and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even the suffering of the sarcology, which is a criminal one of the sarkos.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some people think they'll die and don't want to know anything.
"Since I'll die anyway, it's better I'll be to fight three times a week," they say.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercises, take medicines.
To date, his parents only know that he has suffered cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of classes, I travel, I am active sexual life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and a friend," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to push up his statement by those who are now, in the context of the World Day against AIDS, are afraid.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they are HIV positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person who is responsible.
This report sums up the topic of the fight against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has dealt with the problem of HIV, believes that the great a preciplia between health care programs and a simple citizen is involved.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "in fact, the spread of condoms has increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages for a hundred, and this is very good, but it turns out that there are those who are still not yet having access to the condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"Why do you?" is a popular question, with ehide and condemnation, from social workers, school consultants, pharmacies and health workers who do not want to hear teenagers, assured the propagandist.
I suggest changing this inefficient distribution; so that condoms are not only behind the counters and to have a hundred of them in the vending machines in public toilets in places that are often visited by young people.
This is not a promotion of promiscuity.
It is not about paying for beer and motel, Governor Emilio Gonzalez answered when asked whether the distribution of condoms during his leadership is possible.
"This is not sexuality, it is best to make condoms available to those who are already sexually active," he said.
Key data in Halisco
13.435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV) were registered.
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking on new and total AIDS cases and the 13th on HIV.
92% of infections belong to the sexual path, 6% through blood and 2% to the perinatal path.
It is estimated that 50 thousand people can live with HIV, as there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about it for one registered case.
Given the ratification by the United States Court of Appeals of the United States of Justice of the decision that annulls the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt, achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the scenario establishes a fatal precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures to support the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bands and stars, in conflict with international agreements.
In the practical field, the approval of the decision made on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hayle in the court of bankruptcy of the northern district of Texas, leaves the Mexican firms undefended in the face of the possibility of arrest on their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
However, the resolution opens the doors to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, resulting in three discrepancies.
As an entry, while the judge of the case notes that creditors should be regulated by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth District Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings relate to the tender proceedings considered in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the annulment of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, for this purpose, the UN Standard Law on the Unification of the Law of International Trade was created, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that without inter-corpion voting, recognized in the critical mass of tender production of debts, which had to the parent company branches Vitro, would not have reached the majority necessary for the approval of the restructuring.
However, this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case when this scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-branded debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Productions.
It is also true that by subortalizing the votes of the branches, in one way or another, the creditors Vitro, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the "swent" funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority.
Voting would be 45% against 37 percent.
This data is odagoided by the Court of Appeals.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation that she has faced since 2008, affected by a serious economic crisis that the United States overcoming, striking the country.
So far, the Gonzalez Sad family will appeal against the decision to the appellate court itself, so that the voting reached his plenum, that is, five judges, because only three voted.
In case of failure, an application for a certificate will be filed, which will require the review of the process by the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court of the United States, in this case.
The worst thing is that the court rejected the document sent by the Government of Mexico as amicus curiae ("a friend of a court"), which describes the process that Vitro follows under the Law on Competitive Production, signaling that it frees himself from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries to link it with Article 15 of the US Law on Bankruptcy.
In addition, it is noted that the country has obeyed the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Karambol from two sides: they beat in Vitro and beat the country.
Overall balance
Given the complaints postponed for several months, posted on the table by the trade unions Mexicana de Aviacien against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Trade Union Association of pilots of aviators has already found a bottle neck.

Surrounds by Dragon Mart

Earlier, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the monumental forces, which leveled part of the protected territories with the ground and put forward serious threats against the industry.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The avid basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to it, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico keep in mind as many basketball stories as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And before hemorrhage into the brain chained him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, as a player of small categories, a player of the Higher Basketball League, commissioner and head of the BSN with Bajamon's Covboys and President of the Basketball Federation.
"I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, as when I was the president of the BSN, the Director General of the National Team and the President of the Federation in the 90s," Reyes recalls during the visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabelle, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate, making this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things collected for his long journey, testify to this.
Bayumom in the heart
With the greatest emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cambov, from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years of his performance in the role of a co-agency or agent of the contract.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed most, because I had the opportunity to be part of eight championships of Cambov since 1967, as an agent, co-agency or leader.
There were many years of joy, including five championships, which took place from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, in the year of Jerome Minsi's debut in BSN.
Since then, the "Kuko" Ortis, who was a great administrator, has been the head of the "Kuco," Reyes said.
I remember that Jin Bartov, who was heading here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a very strong player for you, with a height of 6'7."
"Do you want?"
And this was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players who were Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our best scorers.
I remember saying that if Minsi had brought the championship to Baiamon, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the championship of Covboyev with Gaus, but already at a distance, because by 1988 I was already the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy its achievements and achievements of Minsi in the national team.
I remember how we won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup of 1990, at which we got the fourth place and it was to be bronze, if not for the Canadian judge, who forced us to beat the final game, said Reyes.
That team from the World Cup 1990 - is the best team, which you have ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one that won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was the one that with the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and defeated the U.S. national team, which was quite similar to the one that won our bronze at the World Cup.
In that team not only played again Minsi, Gaussa, Ramona Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Piculina" (Ortis), but also young (Havier) 'Toinito Colon and James Carter brothers Leon (Fransi and Edgar) and Mario'Khitoe Morales, who could not participate in 90 years because of the injury of the knee.
The team, which may not be the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the Olympic qualifying tournament in 1995 in Neuken, Argentina.
With role-players like "Kanito' Nijevesa, Pablo Alice and young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for players temporarily dismissed for mess in the Pan-American Mar del Plata championship, we won gold in spite of all forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Pikulin Ortis.
Its performance at international tournaments is impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as Pikulin did.
And this is without taking into account his career in various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best puertorian leader?
This is a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melandez, Carlos Morales, Raimonds Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you think is your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s in the BSN was up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, for the Ponce boys to play only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys travel and play too much, and it's superfluous.
At least I see the results of mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy the society of my wife, Icebel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman died
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth (Texas), became world-famous due to his main role as John Ross Yuing, better known as "J.R.", in the TV series "Dallas," in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate-whose Jay Ar Yuinga in the Dallas television series became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of Dallas, died on Friday evening due to complications caused by cancer, according to the family provided for The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a studio produced by Dallas.
"Larry returned to his favorite hometown of Dallas, once again playing a landmark role that he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him at the Thanksgiving Fair at the Thanksgiving Fair.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was next to Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her representative Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, affectionate and talented, and I will be very bored by him.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," Gray confirmed in the statement.
Hagman had diagnosed liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he admitted that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was found a malignant tumor in the liver and he suffered transplantation.
Long before Dallas, Hagman gained fame on television thanks to the role of a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, astronaut, whose life changes when he meets an attractive gin girl, played by Barbara Iden, and begins to live with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared on the air, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included the roles well-embered by critics in The Group, Harry and Tonto and Prime Colors.
But it was his workshop of interpretation that delightfully disgusting J.R. brought Hagman to the top of fame.
The drama series of the CBS channel about the clan of Yuing and other characters in his environment was on air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot at J.R.?," conceived to create a hype around the episode, full of emotions in which the character Hagman almost killed, gave rise to international discussions and millions of dollars that were risky in bookmakers.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at that time.
When the answer was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned Dallas into the second most-to-play entertainment program in history, after the final "MASH" in 1983, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R., Christine (performed by Mary Crosby), who fired at him.
J.R. interfered with her and then threatened her to accuse her of prostitution if she did not get out of the city, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Yuing as an insatiable corruptionist with a charismatic smile: an unfair entrepreneur and an untrusted husband who wanted his wife an alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), put on treatment.
"I know what should be on the gravestone J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
It must be said: "Here rests an honest citizen J.R. Yuing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone "huge, both on and out of the screen."
It is unforgettable and indispensable for millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who are fortunate to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas issue were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season and the sixth was in production, the channel said.
Warner or TNT has not yet made statements about what will happen to the series after Hagman leaves.
The native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who shined in classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when he was born in 1931 during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatrical stages of New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While he was there, he met a young Swedish artist Maia Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't turn it out that I'd like being able to hurt someone or influence them in any way," he said at that time.
After transplanting the liver, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients who are experiencing fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go to the operation, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some consolation, like "do not be afraid, will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be okay."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course begins, which explores the "End of the World"
Every week students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semey, when Professor of Religion Stuart Sharme decided to read the course of the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible bait: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, for which many people grabbed as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what he had been expected in the next couple of months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call the "long-cargadeddon," and the growing conflict where Israel is drawn, a place where Christian theorists of the end of time believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I did not realize that it would be the most apocalyptic sedestimus of all," said Sharma this week to the students of the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If we analyze what is happening in the world now, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember that the bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic way of thinking.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the theme of the "end of the world" in this sister, theoretically the latter in history.
At the University of Temple Adjunct-professor Barry Vacker reads the course "Medage media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas are spread over time," he said, and the way to which the hypothetical scenarios suggest, causing certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war may break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to examples from real life.
"I tried to tell the students that it is probably possible that it is probably plausible and impossible," - said Vacker.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Matthew Restall, professor of Latin America's history, and Amar Solari's Adjunct Professor of History and Anthropology, joined together to read a course called simply "End of the World."
"We do not add '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the end of the world does not come," said Restal.
Despite the "indestructible destruction," students must learn, prepare projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves no choice for students, except to work "until the night, which is supposed to come the end of the world," said Restal.
The courses were quite popular.
"Thes ended in two hours," - said He spoke about his course for high-average students, which was signed by 35 students.
We have received email messages for weeks before the beginning of the month from the people who asked if there were more spaces.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to observe what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridjid Robinson, 23-year-old student of the division of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic image of thought, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Vekesa, a 25-year-old student of the Department of Psychology and nursing, said that he was watching all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of the course I'd teaching it," he said.
I like it.
But none of the students - not to mention the professor - said that he believes on the date of the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project touched on the Mayan prophecy, and in some way we discredited it," said Julie Zellen, 21-year-old last year student at the University of Temple of West-Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which dates back to several centuries, where people react to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet caused an increase in these speculations.
"In other places people do not think about it," he said.
Predsence in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Docherty, professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course about the "end of the world" there.
"Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at the disposal of the higher instance.
We have pardon from the Pope.
He drew attention to the fact that for a long time it was said many days of the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosophize that on December 21 is the beginning of the seven-year period, after which the world will end.
Students and teachers carelessly refer to this date.
Some said they were going to go to the party "end of the world."
"Maybe I will call someone of friends to laugh together," commented Samir Ford, a 20-year-old student of the Faculty of Communications.
