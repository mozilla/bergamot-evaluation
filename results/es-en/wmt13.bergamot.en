A Republican strategy to hinder Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to fight voter fraud.
But the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and says voter fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people dying from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found only 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And along the same lines a majority of American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that made it difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon has spread following the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of voting rights were introduced in 41 states during 2011.
New election laws require voters to submit an identity card with a photograph, in addition to an American citizenship test.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the ballot and withdraw their right to vote for citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 election, no American state required voters to submit a photo ID.
Indiana State was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
That's why Republican authorities were quick to extend that practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit a photo ID.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11 percent of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity card with these characteristics.
But often obtaining the required identity card costs more than $100.
With this, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 and 20 per cent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, voters who vote Democratic candidates the most, cannot use the identity card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote Republican parties to use documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to file such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers in 2011 supported certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of the ballot in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 led to the fall in the rate of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed legislation in five other states that favored reducing the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 Florida election, 33 percent of voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13 percent of the state's voters.
In the case of Hispanics, the exact same thing happened.
These represent only 11% of voters, equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who make up 76 per cent of the electorate,, accounted for only 46 per cent of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fervently opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, the damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states passed the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they intend to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have passed such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to secure the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: Do the test or not do it?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which useless medical interventions are decided.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant in themselves doubt whether or not screening tests should be done.
Do you test or not?
We've asked two specialists for advice.
Studies in the United States detected a high rate of contagion among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret such data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at the age of 12, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of metastases if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to get the patient to understand the degree of risk of their cancer. You should be given all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not attack long-term life, in which case you should rather opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today many men who have been detected with cancer are not treated, as such cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if progresses, we offer them treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it's important to talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle prescription for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risks of the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%," says Andr√© Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we assess that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The weight
Fatness and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
"Resprobations show that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
The food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large numbers, they scale the risks of colorectal cancer.
Pcharcuterie products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
For the time being, however, their investigations are inconclusive.
As the SCC, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them found a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about each other's family concerns and backgrounds with their doctor.
"Doing the screening test doesn't cause cancer."
Higgs's boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a major shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is a participant in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
What's more, it's about the particle whose existence the standard model predicted: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But it is not entirely clear to the physicists that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data are still lacking to be completely sure.
Anyway, we assume it's Higgs, because the chances of getting wrong seem few. We'll see what it's about.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break that rule and don't try too much, because it will end up hurting yourself.
Although the physics of the particles are a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also such a law in it: Pauli's exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, grossly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who obey wisely at the beginning of Pauli.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboratories, which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the inns, of which we will not talk here, and the "particles of force," by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, you'd stress here, are not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "light particle" that acts as a "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the boson "power bearers."
More stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, that needs to be "disorderly" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it you need to reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide on the surface.
That is why it takes an immense accelerator of particles such as that of CERN (the great hadron collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself glued to the door of a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the rest (how the photon, by the way), do not have it.
"Can what can all these investigations "real up to"?" asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and MS predictions.
For their part, many fervently want them to meet, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that cover certain holes of the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, such as that it does not propose any explanation relating to gravity (ups) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (another ups).
But we haven't found such differences in CERN so far.
Repercussions
The impact of such research on our day-to-day lives are difficult to predict, but we don't think we're wrong to say it won't have any.
For them to see: in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in the labs did not suspect at all the revolution their work would provoke.
They were the scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell labs, said, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pressed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory."
Imagine...
And in addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light catcher in 1969 in the course of his optics research.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this catcher now serves as an "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That doesn't mean, of course, that LHC activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... Le Devoir
In its Dying Dying Commission, Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must resume soon as a bill is being prepared.
However, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Le Devoir has tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Mont√©r√©gie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year respite.
"I had been given five years to live, but I have already been seven," he says, doing a raisin, lying in his bed in the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center of Beloeil, which he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc: a huge weakness that prevents him from going alone to the bathroom and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Brave, he even gets to smile, to talk to strangers who dedicate attention to him, bring him medication and offer him a bath.
The bravery of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is for diarrhea to be cured, it's humiliating," he confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy to that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees on his feet," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Returning to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he says.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, the big moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the palliative care center Victor-Gadbois have cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
The greatest fear of the lady. A., 89, is dying "conscious and drowned."
But the disease has made you discover your children.
"I have good kids," he adds.
"I don't have any more desires left in this life," he says, before accepting that a mask is placed to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the next few days, a last visit from his son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, the care of the body is offered with a group of volunteers and helps food.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, since we know we'll all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues to be in the best possible condition, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying man is offered mouthwatching with brandy or Pepsi, according to the lawsuit.
Diabetics are no longer controlled for their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died over the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois center the days pass without ever being equal.
Next to a 94-year-old man who savors his last family reunion in the yard, well placed among his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after trying everything to survive.
"From six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of age who are cancer sick," the Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent centre come from home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
Seventy-seven per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of his or her life, either at home, in the hospital or in a care facility.
And several organisms, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Grand Montr√©al home palliative care society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative lack in Quebec health care that makes many doctors specializing in palliative care the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, travels to demonstrate his opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system, is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is agreed.
"Recently," he says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER suffering great pain without what was necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients want to die just because they don't get the right care.'
And in parallel, many oncologists stubbornly with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
Helen Richard's hopes for survival were already low when he left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me she was very sorry that she wanted to stop fighting," she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do."
There's no full-kept care.
The Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who apply for death thank their caregivers who have not met them in their demands once they have been relieved of their pain thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely almighty when it comes to pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at Grand Montr√©al, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease is going to have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
Sick people who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want to be relieved."
This report has been made possible by a journalism scholarship from Canada's health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scans in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP businessmen, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell, day after day, what they know about a formidable "system," of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafia are part.
An "industry" that was too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system is pulverized once we've hunted the big media," ironizes Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec deputy and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by a thorough investigation into embezzlement linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal prime minister at the time, Jean Charest, had consented only to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption between officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry would have saved $1 billion in contracts," containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, while waiting to be able to "demonstrate the ploys behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government controllers, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of "the Marteau Squad," who, since 2009, have caused the Montreal "sewerage cartel" to be moderated when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has conducted a serial search of fraud and corruption charges against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post of mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
There are suspected of pocketing repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Montreal road network engineers and Italian-born businessmen such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito have been formally charged.
The latter has caused shock in explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal for three years to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montr√©al, Mayor G√©rald Tremblay's party.
M. Zambito distributed money to the right and sinister during the 2000s, granting more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals in power.
He also admitted to organizing a collection of illegal funds for former Liberal prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation in the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted they received money for inflating bills by 30 to 40 per cent in false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected politicians to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Riviare-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land acquired for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the midst of the real estate boom.
70% of the money from election campaigns was dirty money
From the investigation that will finally be carried out, she says she pulls "a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and fish the culprits."
He adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We're cleaning up the wounds but it would take a clean investigation unit in Montreal and be very alert so that dubious practices don't repeat themselves.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is mostly concerned about the role of the ""politicians elected to the speed."
Estimating at 70 per cent the proportion of dirty money spent on election campaign funding in Quebec, he ironizes: "I've been told that's nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "as long as electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It presides over a complete review of the system of granting public contracts and party financing: "We cannot fall lower; going to the bottom of things, courageously, will allow us to rebuild the house with a stronger foundation, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona."
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I'm going from day to day by day.
The technical staff have also brought me a lot.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't hunt.
From my beginnings at the preformation centre of INF Clairefontaine to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced to leaps and bounds.
He will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me feel like fighting and giving everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is backed by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the man the team needed?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one the same in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think he'll take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In League One, Lyon has taken away the leadership position.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth finals in style.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We're going to try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
We want, to begin with, to finish the first of our league against Porto so that we can receive the round of eighth finals.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
You've got the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, PSG is given to its means for this project to be implemented.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as in last season, would it constitute a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in taking that champions title.
In the last season we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think he'll be the good guy.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it away.
Do you think the media expect more from PSG?
It's normal for them to expect a lot from us if we think about what's invested in the players we have.
We've fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, they still come up with things to blame for is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City, who, after two seasons, hasn't managed to qualify for the eighth finals, and they've invested a lot too.
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points ahead of the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
That shows League One is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG look totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's successes.
We'd better say we have a "Zlatande."
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and scores a lot of goals.
He has come to prove he is the star of League One.
And he's shown in every team he's been through that he's been a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How have you lived the 2012 Euro Cup with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Euro Cup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things in there and I came out reinforced.
Today I manage to play good games in the selection.
That's what I expected from my baptism with the "bleus."
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and to this is why we have exemplary behaviour today.
What vision do you have from Didier Deschamps' first month at the head of the "bleus"?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the Euro Cup.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take the team to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) on October 16 in Spain serve to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn't lived a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and prosecution charges between the parties.
Moreover, as is often the case in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual convertible currency to dollars, euros, etc. and a safe exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files of equal to equal.
Nearby 200,000 transactions have been recorded through 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The bitcoin's listing, having reached the top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $25 months later, before returning today to around $10 (quotas are dinner on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is not impressive when compared to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a virtual currency report published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency," "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual coin types such as "credits," used to advance in a video game and which can be won by playing or can be bought (and sometimes even redeem).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in any exchange a central authority controls and deals with the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositories of accounting books, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two e-mail addresses in the form of an email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is signed electronically through a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are contained in the public accounts book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge thrown at computers and the winner, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of cutting file, that is, transforming a large file into a shorter and more unique numerical footprint.
Computers "coer" the new transaction and add a number before "swetching" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular print (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it's the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, as both have different prints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the hundred billionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in every increase in the computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The failure used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money white money thanks to this anonymous service.
But the cash has the same flaw.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80 percent of bitcoins don't circulate.
In November the "giant shoots" were launched.
"They changed $30,000," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that currency, believes quite a lot in the potential of this technology in addition to the transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come out cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to put in place in shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to review hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to impose itself, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB also plans to revalue the various risks, now considered high, should this currency succeed.
We've left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished mainly the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks join their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to the French credits, was made in order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, monitored by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx in Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of fighting between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old Mujahedins, the current government and the current Taliban share a desire to keep women in a lower position.
The leading figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, taking to government land to resell them as plots for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting alongside huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65 percent of its population under 25, Kabul now has 5 million people, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are filled with both girls and boys.
Work will have to be given to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including armed opposition, is avid on mobile phones. Television and its Turkish folks featuring a modern world have great fans across the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight are already concerned about reconstituting provincial militias, which will flee central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of the prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country depended on foreign aid from the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been fixed or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumours spread that Afghanistan possessed vast mining wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to take over.
Without the energy to extract iron or copper ores from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mines of Mon Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig out the huge Buddha site and remain there as the province's largest employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, the country on which imports and exports are widely dependent, will also need to restore their normal relations.
French troops departed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls &apos; schools, boys' schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain locations.
These works, greedy to obtain local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increase of growing areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military expenses?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in those valleys often located more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
For them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me that they want, it would be necessary to maintain small, well controlled civil aid and that reaches them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever about the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants him full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And Egypt has been using a multi-modified provisional text for almost two years, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial mess.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" and continues to "treache his word" and "foot the right."
On the part of his supporters, it is ensured that this is a measure to put an end to the institutional and political crisis faster and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be organised over the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their draft to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way of recovering popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversial cause havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or they vote for my text or I retain the full powers," powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist for the vast majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most Liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, a little before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, surrogate members, were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As expected, the articles voted have been unanimous.
On the other hand, it is grashes that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent Clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, object of all eyes, remains finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Shariah constitute the main source of law."
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental vindication, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "the rules," which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing more than an advertising trick.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who is to confirm its conformity with Shariah laws.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy."
Liberals' fears are also heightened by the fact that the university's next rector would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no specific religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, as the terms used imitate religious vocabulary.
"We refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to rule over all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will argue that they are few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
In the military's wish, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor will prosecution of civilians be prohibited in military courts, as requested by human rights associations.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticized.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to leave last night on television, demonstrations are scheduled for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Earth combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal stack" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus' miracles: the conversion of water into wine in the wedding, walking on the waters, the appeasement of the storm, and the full nets.
In this very place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the largest number of holy sites are in Jerusalem.
Believers travel here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretorio, where the trial was carried out, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of Anointing and to the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their desires, which will then come true.
Make a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress was left of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great had built in the year 25th. C. for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And get there by their own means, only those who dedicate themselves to climbing can.
The others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermon ski resort, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
Bus services are offered from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, at the top of the mountain supposedly lived pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
On a single trip you won't be able to visit them all.
But it's worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli parliament).
It preserves the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Qummings of Qumr√°n, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judea, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his painting exhibition he has canvases by impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, C√©zanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha Bathroom Museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers from that time.
In Caesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive private Ralli museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dal√≠.
There are no tour guides or shops of the future there.
Entry is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
Israel's three main tourist areas are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not drop from 21 degrees and the air heats up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathed there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily hold even those who don't know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People arrive here to spend treatment courses with salt water, brine and healing mud and fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
They are preserved by the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It passed through the famous maritime route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets bearing the names of the Zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find couples of newlyweds who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph themselves.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not advisable to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged to sh√©quels (currently 1-3 dollars,8 sh√©quels).
Urban transport is mainly made up of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travelling on any type of public transport costs 6 sh√©ke and for this price you can travel by transhipping for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their jobs.
But a new work week begins on Sunday morning.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, unpaeded fish and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of plates based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are ground lizard balls, fruits and vegetables.
No stray dogs are seen on the streets of Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats who "fly to your liking" in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The rumronmers love crowded places and don't reject the treats.
Rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance, you go out for $15 a day.
And the rental of a bike will be out for 15 sh√©kels the day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 sh√©quels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came touring the country and rested were citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 11.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds the same index of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The Big and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for tongue
While deputies and human rights defenders discuss the consequences of the law on compulsory examination, scammers have already appeared in the country who trade "false" certificates
Every year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force, according to which each immigrant working must carry out an examination to verify his knowledge of the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service provision sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, exams will be mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to give the examination of the language, but also that of Russian history and that of the basis of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
The citizens of countries where Russian is the official language is an exception.
Persons who managed to obtain their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 shall not be subject to this Act.
Utility, fatality and defense of rights
The network of examiners will be run by the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, People's Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to test in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 such centres are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by deputies from the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But the rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask this question to the press: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will bring the obligation of knowledge of the language, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, representatives of the Immigration Service respond, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery."
Many people talk today about defending the rights of labor immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of Russia's Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must be initiated before departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are faced by immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be doomed to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, put a "paid trip" into a creepy and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him consume each other for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise them one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages," confirms the head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Tajik Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be angry, Chief.
Meanwhile, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that not only do they not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also in their own language they write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to mention dressing, and to buy them what is necessary for the school.
When they get to adolescence, these kids venture to work at the first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize.
"You feel humiliated and inferior".
However, as far as the language law is concerned, rights advocates point to an important point.
The tests will be conducted only for immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden to pass to strangers"
Many visitors say that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in bureaucratic hurdles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a fake inscription can be done quickly and by only one thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and extortion cases appear.
"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajikistan's citizen, Umed Hushkadamov, told reporters.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that not only can immigration registration documents be false.
Several "false" language-knowledge certificates have already been seized by Federal Immigration Service officials.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is twice and a half more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the anti-corruption system so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, government officials and rights advocates converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers who could not successfully pass the test the first time to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
Home Office does not take drastic action against illegal arms trade
The percentage of recorded weapons offences is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly to civilian arms owners.
This is the government's reaction to the recent incidents: Squeezing shots during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogr√°dov, in which Seven people lost their lives.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a licence to carry weapons, from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the weapons possession law will be taken to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying "hard-handed politics."
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures be desisted as "nonsense rigor."
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, he told the BBC news service in Russia, criminal lawyer Vasiliy L√©snikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of firearms were committed in internal affairs bodies for six months in 2012, compared to the total of 1168 crimes recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian arms sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to head to the black market.
Now, in his words, in Moscow you can find any low-priced gun.
Meanwhile, the Home Office says the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black market for weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High General Staff.
Screenshot of website accepting weapons orders
The first, "vestige of the army or military," that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the same Caucasians," Baranets says.
The following type of "black ham," those stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditatedly provoked to cover the fault," says one ex-military.
According to Baranets, gun manufacturers also put their grain of sand.
"Private arms factories that are not competitive on the international market and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including Moscow, have proliferated," says the expert.
One more source on the black market is smuggling.
A large number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate involvement of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Governance Planning.
Specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data on portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market guns have arrived there "because of officials whose work is gun-related," the report says.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14 per cent of cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5 per cent correspond to "illegal archaeology."
The dependent on one of the gun stores, who asked for his last name not to be mentioned, says the weapons found by illegal diggers have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers head to military warehouses when they need a departure.
Through some ensign, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT pistol.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"He takes the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two chargers," he tells us
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be complied with, they make test purchases of illegal weapons traders," adds the dependent.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me to go to the "Begovaya" platform, where would be a man who would take me to a "squinny" where we could negotiate.
Of the price of the gun, I found out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
There are sellers in the markets, but there you also have to go, let's say "on Mr. Ivanovih, who asked to tell her that her daughter had fallen a tooth.'
I can even get a couple of steel mittens through a trusted person.
He supplies them to me, too, just because he knows I'm not going to rat him out.
The rookies are looking for guns in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s as he prepared to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, in his words, have not changed.
He was given a photo album where there was "nothing."
"I felt like I was in a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
The buyer, in Baranets' words, is not offered cat per hare: everything there is can be tasted.
I, as a potential customer, don't just buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun fires well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Shop of sofas
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where you offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
This requires no documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the ad title "Buy a gun or machine gun."
There users place their orders and put questions.
And they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," he asks the user "Iv√°n" (preserved anthographer).
"Compro TT pistol. Moscow," laconically asks his question "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two-handed ones who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like a hungry fish to bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia.
Military and ex-military commentator Viktor Baranets
I've heard of these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the reach of Russian laws.
People place the orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send him a photo and instructions so he knows where the gun is hidden," says the NGO press secretary "The Right to Arms," Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets says if you place an online order, you run out of a gun and put you in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two-handed ones who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, experts say, one can spend $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms," a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300.
You'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from military warehouses by middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7 per cent, representing 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Employees at fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike
Up to a quarter of American teens find their first jobs as cashiers on "McDonald's"
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages have begun in the United States that are paid in the Walmart corporation supermarkets and restaurants at popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."
For now no one dares to say whether or not this wave will reach nine points, or if it is intended to lose strength and dawn in its early stages.
Protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the aim of the organizers of the protests is to create workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The shares began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." On that day, in the United States, the orgy of rebates that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers at the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, abandoned their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside the unions and left-wing activists in the corporation's stores, whose products are aimed at modest and moderate-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, game rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those of larger supermarkets.
That's why many low-paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
That "Black Friday" the rally participants demanded the increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 an hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1 per cent more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart puts the pay rise on consumers' shoulders, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters say the protest took place in just nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation.
"Black Friday" lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made the "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that they left their job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than "another PR trick," organized by the workers' union.
Freed harge.
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not precisely the Walmart department store (which in this progressive city has no appreciation for them, and that is why for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and then they don't even give you sick leave and you're not paid for your honest work.
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York
Currently, under federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
Fast-food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, regular workers receive $8.90 an hour in New York.
Nobody wins less than they do in this town.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it's something incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teens passed through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few were the ones who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live off this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum in the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them with.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, that is, their current minimum wage be doubled.
They also demanded that workers' unions be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing them from doing this right and punishing union movement activists with trickery and firing.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast-food sector.
One of the main is the excessive turnover of staff.
Discordant
Roarful protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, which involved several local Democratic politicians, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and then doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest job."
Protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as City Mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said "we must support workers in the fast food sector to get fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves."
As the New York Times described it, this has been the biggest manifestation of its kind in American fast food history.
But it involved only a few hundred people, including not all of them being employees of the fast food service, where tens of thousands of people from New York work.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, fooling the brain is not so easy"
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, is recently perceived normally mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Early in the summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a moving model and then, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft's Lab in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was concluded that for the company's scientists, the glasses already belonged to a previous stage.
They are attracted to the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of virtual open spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of study of your research group?
We engage in person-computer interaction, but we also try to broaden the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its large mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look at 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We're trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
The world of computing must be freed from ours, to the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those silly virtual reality helmets.
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think you overstate it?
- Of course you can't consider it a panacea, you've got to solve the issue of privacy, as you don't always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think about gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the device's camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it's very big, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture - voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can of soda?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- I mean, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do right now?
Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we're going to have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the person's reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good in-depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do you lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, the current generation is what the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition can be.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Speed, the number of frames per second, is also important.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern serially produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects man-machine interaction.
An equivalent of such a device would be very useful to me for my work, but it does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And you don't have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras," one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible fingerboard sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the camera location curvature and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- From what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, hasn't presented its glasses to the public.
Does it not seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, hanging out all the way holding a smartphone in your hands isn't very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an augmented "transmutable" reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could move from glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in that there is their strength (private things only you will be able to see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects along with other people.
Let's imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects on air is available not only to Tony Stark from the film "Iron Man," but also to any mere mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response.
Hands feel nothing.
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh break in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of second hand in support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly.
But there are also technologies that are truly aimed at bringing tangibility to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a similar feeling to the one you feel if someone was blowing it on the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence nerve finger endings, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what it looks like he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight with for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he goes to an open, almost endless space. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That's what makes work with virtual reality attractive to researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception.
Personal subjective gustole rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardismo de St. Petersburg," dedicated to the citizens in front of, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of St. Petersburg's art and scene, whose achievements go beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophers of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg's late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the smile inhabitants and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took an organillo in his hands and became the organiller of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to play such a difficult role, because of his bohemian existence, philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around town dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little grey arouses aggressiveness and agitation of unlditions.
But my provocations are aimed at a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
- When did you understand that you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists was over, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists from the new wave, with the subsequent ones on display in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10," and the new wave is over.
I plunged into the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
- And all this came together in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to meet at the cultural centre of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be brought together.
In 1995, I ran a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no renovations, there was a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the bohemian house of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh."
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wearing tight trousers, including now fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was a cheerleader for many programs before Hali-galivskih's time.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137," the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and regular customers.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the prize was "The people of our city."
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected, so ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our time it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity go apart. One can be popular but very uncultured.
- There's something recognizable about your jobs.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the current and the occurrence.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so it's painful and scary.
But in the clowns everything is embarrassed and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and obligatory change of clothing.
Now one is followed by clothes, orienting themselves externally, but not inside the person.
And maybe that person shouldn't even shake his hand, but spit in his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
- We saw you recently in the role of urban organiller. - A cultured city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people gathered in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the other simlons.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Now you have to think who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has its 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov, they're in the thousands.
- The abandoned ones are going to see it, there the sex-social sphere works.
And to a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not spoil what you've achieved.
When I was young he made such paintings that a collector had them hanged on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started paintings, with which people usually end up.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint painting paintings.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is one concept: a cultural officer.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the Kings were the right ones everything was otherwise, the kings might not understand the culture very well, but they knew it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they are closed, because experts are needed at a higher level who correctly evaluate them and open their way.
Now the subjective personal taste is thriving.
So Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. There is much more culture in Moscow, there is land there.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are plenty of people curious who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or crashing with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft with humans on board depart in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is asked: How can the species continue in weightless conditions or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the chief investigator of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Reproduction problems in space with flora began to be addressed.
Half a century ago, plant experiments were carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were not different in any of the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, the dorosophiles.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops in weightless conditions.
We get a normal chick.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, it must stay on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the laboratory director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When they couldn't find support, the chicks gave random flips.
And after 10 hours in the newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
Chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we got the chicks to be born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," Vladimir Sychev says about the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" only species of one sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a proper emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years.
Tereshkova's most risk was over.
And the most precious thing about humanity is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it's after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, to this question no one has answered," says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight into space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are counted who after long flights everything has worked well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even on orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, Russian hero Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratorium of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre is a mandatory stage in preparation for flight.
In no-float conditions, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable, if still hostile, environment for a newborn child it is his birthplace.
The little anhibious men seem to confirm that life on earth came from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, gravitation, the force of gravity is necessary for women.
In the weightlessness the abdominal muscles and the pelvis are decrepited very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we skip that, relying on the action of childbirth stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it will push it.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress in a special workout suit, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally misfit person," says the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time this will be a reality, when humans on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Head of NKE: Inspection of the "Evarc" system has not found the guilty politician
With regard to public awards, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application is high.
Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Office of Supreme Control (NK) states in an interview for Aktu√°ln.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," the current situation describes.
Joint checks by Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Neas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "Evarc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the SDG (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with inspectors. So, is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, nor can the president of the government prevent the action of the office that has an obligation to carry out such controls or to demand obligations," Kala says.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the common project between the Czech and German teams, in which the legislation on public awards in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started to carry out about two years ago.
Put simply: European legislation regularises how public awards should be organised, followed by the legislation in force in each country and then the praxis itself.
We have put everything together and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "stricter and more complete," however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly stringent rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually contribute? What do you think the conclusions are?
It could help us to stop investing in the realization of laws, reducing and improving limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The savings economy means getting a right thing at a reasonable price (which doesn't always mean the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not because of lowering the award limit means we're going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paper," that those who want to look for system failures will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public awards.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NK or is it organized differently?
As for the offices, such as the NK, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a college, as well, the only thing is that in their case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
Competitions are also to some extent analyst, however, while Germany has a federal organisation, the courts of accounts are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities there in Germany, are controlled in the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
Usually, I wouldn't like to make a comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it is not possible to specify exactly what is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of inspectors?
That's certainly not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make these kinds of comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If not, it would be no benefit for them to collaborate with our office, would it?
As for our country's legislation, what did the amendment of the law on public awards mean to your Office? Is its incidence manifested in any way?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex post checks, there is a need for some delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new tool of "uneconomic risk detection," through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified.
Do you consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or rather a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation "is tightened" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
As with the previous regulations, controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each law not respected in the area of public procurement meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to toughen the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal failure, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how does he get out of this?
We'll see where this path is going.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Evarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the varc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then even the prime minister of the government cannot prevent the Office's action that has an obligation to carry out such controls and demand obligations.
He can say, "We change the law and allow it," but he can't say we'll pretend like nothing.
In the law on public awards, the regulations are quite strict as to how formal action should be taken. And that's how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer for not meeting formal demands.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
Roads have ice plates, although mostly they are passable
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most tracks are passable, in some caution should be exercised.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but had ice plates and snow.
The temperature drops and will range from five to ten degrees below zero. During the day thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the layer of snow is thin.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Metallic Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor because of the fog, according to information from the region's road operations control centre.
The R6 fast track and the first-class road in the region are now unfettered.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be icy and slippery.
Also, all second and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
In some of them, however, there are still stretches of ice and snow.
Road care needs to be increased, especially in the highest areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Kr√°lov√©
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the tracks, the Directorate of Roads and Highways reports on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frost can occur in the vicinity of Lan.krouna, Elst√≠ nad Orlic√≠, Polisky, Svitav or Vysok√©ho M.ta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been treated chemically.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains of Krkonoe to Orlick√© hory.
There is a layer of snow stump in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kn?nou and Trutnov.
In the area of the Eastern Bohemia, the sky will be between clear and partially cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range from three below zero to a positive degree, a weak wind blow.
Region of Pilsen
Roads in the Pilsen region are passable today morning, although caution must be exercised and time will need to be adapted.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frost, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some tracks could also be covered in ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is evident from the information of the road control centre in the region.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road bordering Germany there may be stretches of ice plates.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so, in this case, there are also warning of stretches with ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the less busy tracks in the area of Eumava.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will find partially throwing snow away.
After the chemical treatment, snow was still left in the port of .ervenohorsk√© and on the road in the direction of Videlsk-k√≠.
Road operators removed the snow during the night; on the road of Iumper about three centimeters of snow accumulated, according to the road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are passable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the road of umper, snow remains remain.
Drivers in the port of Eervenohorsk√© will encounter half-disaster snow in the direction of Jesen√≠k," confirmed today an operator of the road administration from Uumper to the TK.
On the ground and at night their colleagues also went to the Jesenick√° and, after chemical treatment, the clues of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the tracks are unfettered, in that of Eternbersk√° drivers should drive with caution in the forest sections, where the roads are still humid.
Region of Est√≠ nad Labem and Liberec region
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications on different sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or ice cream, according to the police database, the mountain road between Telnice and Kn√≠nice in the region of Est√≠ nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero, even in the lower areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road. On the other hand, in the lower areas, especially in the south-east of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No service complications have been recorded for the mmento.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of the .t.t√≠.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal overnight. During the day it is expected rain and snow that melts and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavorable conditions have been announced from the general roads on the I/13 road, on the border between the region of Est√≠ nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kn√≠nice had to be cut off by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
Eimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in just under a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of the many other alarmist news that we like to hold on to.
The music group The Tap Tap likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state charity event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar set for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The previous day, on 20 December at 9 p.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, entitled "End of the world, cancelled."
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can it be heard at charity concerts?
Of course it is, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
It will be sung by all the performers at the same time in the three concerts.
The anthems will link to each other simultaneously thanks to the special broadcast live on Czech Television.
Has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the video clip, where Xindl X also sings...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charities and concerts...
We are making every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and amused to work with us.
What will the money raised at concerts against the end of the world be used?
To the equipment for the Studeo barrier-free educational center, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedli.k.v √∫stav.
Students at the school of Jedli-v √∫stav are regularly visited by teachers with whom they do fun and interesting activities.
Pupils do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedliak. √∫stav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
Several groups and performers perform in each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan B√°rta, The Tap Tap, Mari√°n Bango and Jia Su. Such.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan for any other similar "spectacular action" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prask√© jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I, personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your overseas plans are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
What is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it can look at first glance.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
So far, however, we've managed well. I and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which keeps surprising me.
Even in Moscow, where we've recently returned from, it all came out smoothly.
Thanks to departures abroad you can compare society's different attitudes towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you met so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is still not frequent for a person to travel alone through the city centre in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been established to address the problems of persons with disabilities.
On what aspects should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we go behind...
But it is important to mention that improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a severe disability to travel on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want to...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this regard, with The Tap Tap we are a little ahead of us.
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes for eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers to emerge, it will really start to change everything.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a great willpower.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedlikav √∫stav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And in time, as our moderator Angelovic says, we got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, popularity hasn't come until these last few years, did I be wrong?
It really helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also actively work to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the job that is not seen is as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
You meant to get this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, that you can do something differently.
The world of entertainment is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, everything new is cautiously welcomed and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and we should have compassion for.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something works out for people with disabilities, then it is not only a step forward for them, but for society as a whole.
Did you help the fact that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their heads in the clouds and when they find out that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria abandons them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already in the early 1998s?
Only one: La√°a Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help.
Whoever has will and will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20, at 9 p.m.
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fl√©da de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic will participate
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via video conference to jointly sing the group's song The Tap Tap "Fin of the World, cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free educational centre in Prague's Jedliak-v, which costs 25 million Czech crowns.
Entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free tickets to the early sale option at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
Poland was accepted as a twelfth member of ESA at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week. It is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, Poland's path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in flights into space before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the A-conference. Eternfeld at the Warsaw astronomical observatory in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics."
The young engineer's ideas (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, Eternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Eternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andr√© Louis Hirsch Award in France for their "Introduction to cosmonautics."
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he named himself to one of the craters on the hidden face of the moon.
Already in 1925 a dresine was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the project's facilities are not known either.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the dresin boot or brake.
Information about this dresine is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 Polish artillery began to engage in missiles.
The research was funded by Kom√≥rka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the investigation reached the stage of the practical evidence.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohoziski appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpea powietrzna i rakietobomba lonicza," by the author Leliwa-Krzyblocki, was published.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymccesowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile technical projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautics Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 edition of the magazine Problemy, society is referred for the first time to four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, from the prof. M. Subotowicze proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
Artificial satellite projects had already been launched at that time and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in autumn of the same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Beginning in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM probe rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first released on October 10, 1958.
The rocket was at an apoge of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm long and did not reach 5 kg of weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in summer 1959 aerial tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets in the desert of Bd√≥w began.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was going to have a 14.5km heyday and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the space available to scientific devices.
On the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for volume was 0.4 liters, in the 0.34 litre Meteor-1B and 0.62 litre Meteor-1C.
The peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first aerial tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km high.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was built.
Mention should also be made of Poland &apos; s entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the research of cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladim√≠r Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional court suspended the law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
Of course it will be interesting to look at the problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
This therefore means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause is in the principle of free trade and free and unlimited private capital movement, along with rampant financial speculation.
The effect of the large differences in labour costs (of wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to do so "provokes a drop" in the price of the competitor with the aim of taking over most of the market and thus increasing its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying cheaper there or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, with this, it is not responsible for the unemployment generated by this phenomenon, the state's social spending is necessarily growing.
All this situation fosters the total disinterest of entrepreneurs in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their desire to obtain benefits.
The situation is universally so well known that there is no need for specific statistical data.
Unscrupulous practices in private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the Governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own people without regard to social decline.
This is mainly evident in the changes in existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictate of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees in terms of labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with the widening gap between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, food delivery points have been in Germany for poor people who cannot keep their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid already reaches one million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed with such low wages that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum essential to survive.
Such a scandal related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The savings measures of virtually all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation. People, under pressure from an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live on a lousy salary on the edge of society, in the hope that one day private investment capital will arrive in the country.
Do you need to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never reaches, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim to satiety that the state should not bring capital to the economy, which directing the economy leads to its failure.
Private equity defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence its selfishness in the political march and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in very powerful and omnipresent practice, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the area of corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, commission private legal companies, which are often linked to industry, to draft laws.
These types of bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly in a situation like the one described by Appi√°nos in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been disintegrating for some time and the administrations dealt with the force."
In exchange for bribes, illegitimately obtained favors and help to fund stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread without any impediment and people went to the polls with the vows praised in advance..." "There were no people on a character to aspire to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state spent eight months without consuls..." "He began to be serious about the fact that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man..." Although Appi√°nos thought of Pompeii, Caesar came to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in seniority, is that today's society is based on inconsiderate preferences of individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not able, in essence, to understand and claim the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as that of then, a decadence of the unprecedented elite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect for the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the law on public awards is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at international and EU level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution involves concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the lab of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (nothing came of violence and nothing could do), Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (let's not forget how fragile we are).
"If my children didn't want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, mixed reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on the Israeli side, argues in favor of the right to self-defense and encasses Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism by the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and labels Israel a terrorist state.
I don't want to focus on who is guilty of the massacres that are repeated periodically and who the victim is. After all, today &apos; s citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born in the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who takes advantage of the tensions that have dragged on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour statement in November 1917) on a small area of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have reached on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, about who or what group of people are the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind the history of power struggles is in the front row.
In each era we can find a Great Alexander or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or whether behind their throne there was someone who oriented their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this implies, it has not been possible to reach in a single generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don't know, but I don't discard it): the Rothschilds.
You don't write much about them.
Naturally.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost all the central banks in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is preparing: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack by Iraq they were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the central bank Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the Civil War to print money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for unleashing the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their eagerness for world power led them during the years 1859 to 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by Freemason Albert Pike, decorated with Grade 33.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially in Great Britain, and the third aimed to reduce the population of the land by half a million to one billion people (like a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (Ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary draft for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of richest families operates, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a deterioration of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of World War I, they destroyed tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unwarrantedly from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
To prepare for the terrain of World War II, they allowed bankers and politicians to create, in a covert way, a conflicting situation following the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thus creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, it was enough for the Germans to serve the Fuehrer's solution, which was strong and simple enough and pointed to culprits, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that it had to represent and represented so well the function of the fifth column, which caught the flame and provoked the outbreak of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour statement laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and the first conflicts with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks were taking place on both sides.
World War II erupted: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which the international bankers had him tied at the beginning or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way in which war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was created for a third war.
If international bankers were to start it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a frontline victim, now along with the Arab or, generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within its country, but also at the international level. Let us take as an example how Israel's sympathizers and detractors are categor and detractors divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice engender injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their eagerness for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does his best to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, where 20% of all world oil passes (the navigation corridor is only two miles wide), it would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light is the words David Rockefeller uttered in 1994 - "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls his whole being.
"And it forces everyone, small and large, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on the right hand or on the forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
You need to understand: whoever has two fingers in front, who add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo Movie: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of the Islamist student demonstration occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned shah Mohamed R√©za P√°hlevi, who after the revolution fled to the US, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive perspective: throwing the shah overboard could not allow it, since, if it did, it endangered the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to forcibly release the hostages.
The jailed diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the US, his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Director and actor Ben Affleck's film "Argo" theatre themes an episode of this story, which reaped a small hit for America.
Shortly before the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up at the Canadian embassy's residence.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for this it helped a covert story a strange point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team examining the location in the country for the shooting of a sci-fi overproduction.
Combination of genders
The plan outlined by "exaction" expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood collaboration.
To make the lie seem truthful, the film project was written in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a royal office.
Details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "capermov," the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines moods. We found on the one hand well-documented sequences of Tehran. The sequence of credits shows emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were reflected in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And besides, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits who analyze the situation on the negotiating table, in the hallways of the office, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Goodbye Little, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which the action takes place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran "whishes" in Canada.
The film's best scenes take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy's takeover is impressive for its synoptic capacity, which, at the same time, conveys the excitement of bewilderment and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the impostor team in Tehran's bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story doesn't offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And he manages pretty well. Sometimes it adds something to reality: here doesn't everything come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis at Tehran airport is stalking, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search behind its track turn into madness).
Argo's weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are by no means the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic stroke, but it's a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, valuing its realization and the retro style of a thriller evoking the 1970s.
But if it collapses, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey of the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop."
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent share of women in leadership positions in large European companies," explained Pr√°vo Patrik Nacher, the survey's organiser.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women were ahead of better prices in life insurance because they objectively pose a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas of the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher reported.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to the fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the hat-twis the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual ban on using the term "butter butter" or the removal of the classic bulb from shops has been criticised.
A quality banana must be 14 centimeters long.
The Union apparatus makes such decisions often under pressure from one or the other commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobbyist were behind the request, for example, that higher-quality bananas should be at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "abnormal curds."
The European Commission defended itself by saying that this is only seeking to harmonise national standards not homogenised to date, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have softened on the basis that the existing directive carries a waste of groceries.
The candidate to win the poll could be last year's U.S. prescription that in inflatable balloons that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The U.S. was referring here to an American study that, when talking about toys, balloons are the leading cause of child death from suffocation.
A similar restriction applicable to the use of matasuegras by children up to 14 years of age is also in force.
Curious run-in are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the Macedonian name. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, we must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovn√≠poplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume established for canned mushrooms, which posed a substantial fine threat.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application for grants.
This kind of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation," said then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas in autumn 2004 (SSD).
He argued this with the fact that a lot of cereal was produced in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was ready to help the Czech Republic and organized a public competition for the purchase of cereal from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant for receiving a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the ministry for local development led by Minister Pavel Nomec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended to draw up applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often the target of criticism, the EU's regulatory efforts and, also, more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which Member states have achieved in budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also touched on the sensitive fiber, as do other countries of the Union, the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, even if our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the olomouc requising, but had to change the name of the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and was renamed "tuzem√°k."
Only products made from the distilling of sugar cane can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known all over the world, the marzipan of the German city of L.beck or the Parma ham, you can already find for example the biscuits of Karlovy Vary, the Pohoelice tent and of T.Ibo- and even the variety of hops of Eatec.
As protected EU maras, you can be proud of Pardubice's gingerbread and the bars of Hosice v Podkrkono-√≠.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Mr. Senator, how did you think of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If in our country it was all right, then I wouldn't run.
But I can no longer bear to see how it has been stolen in our country in the last twenty years, how thieves go unpunished, taxes are raised and retirement age.
He had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I'm forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have of changing things is to run as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after he has set out on his way to the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy for president depended on the results in the Senate election.
Later I specified that if I was elected a senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can realize my own ideas.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and the strongest mandate possible.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but we trample on anyone who wants to initiate a change.
Added to this is the media, which discredit you and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
From me it is said that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an advisor to Jisi Paroubek.
Let's talk about his ideas.
He presents himself to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership above twenty million.
To do this, the law must be changed.
As president he does not have this competence and only the senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group so that the guide office is recognized as self-employment, and we get it.
The problem lies in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, whether they are right-wing or left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to win the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without encasing or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is he more of a right-wing or left man?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me, whether it's a bit of left or a bit of right.
What matters to me is that we get ahead.
I don't care if someone is right or left, I want to bring people together.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KS-M or the SDG and I will also be against bad ideas.
He jokes when you say he's populist.
But you're not proving it with what you say?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of parliament, he has only slogans left.
And with that he cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you turn to people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and to try to put them on my side to achieve this.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live broadcast on television in which I would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character pointing to the disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Let us take the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I say I'm just an amateur, I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies.
I just started in politics and tried to get as much support as possible for my program.
I'm trying to get things done myself, but in case it doesn't work out, I'll leave it in six years' time and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that with a person I do nothing, that's why I've visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to run for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Janura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I have supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencov√°, who brought to light oil frauds into light heating.
I showed up on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the scales.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two in the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to bring about change.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the blameless past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have money.
I don't have money for the campaign for the presidency, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 kronor.
You don't have money?
Talk about property statements, how's yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a flat valued ten million, another flat valued at eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and an koda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of millions.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youthful dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought evil and injustices.
Does it drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at $60 million and you don't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to get in debt?
I've already put in the campaign 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that there's not much interest in my program.
And I don't have an obligation to pay the campaign with money out of my pocket.
The campaign expenses essentially cover what I will receive as a senator's salary.
But I couldn't live off it. For example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 kronor a month.
If I wanted to only make money, then I wouldn't run for a candidate.
So you'll continue your business to live?
Didn't you say before you were going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I have in part left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring.
People would want it to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I need to live off something, too.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I keep winning.
If I were president, then I'd leave business.

The architecture studio MVRDV shows that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently completed "book mountain" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and there's finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby who passes by the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is nice."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody comes in for like-yes in those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom city located at the gates of Rotterdam that barely deserves a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honour of having risen with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this embarrassing situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that are represented on euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that's how the policy makers decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics: a library had to be built.
Winy Maas, of the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings at the same time as cynical, took the theme with his usual serenity and appeared to the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked perplexed around him and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, the so-called "Boekenberg."
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain rises in the planned location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and townhouse buildings.
In early November, the mountain of books was awarded the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project is also nominated for the 2012 "Dutch National Wood Award."
In this way, the small city without history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town hall after whose white facade one would rather intuit a milk plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a quesera.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountain massif, but the real lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to melt with their topography at every step of climbing to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the brick floor and the elegant lanterns unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
By raising the view you can see the park's banks, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally book shelves are arranged along the facade and in the middle opens a huge dark room that is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is turn the classic spatial configuration upside down and take the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well taken advantage of: in the middle there are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of mural cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers all the day shake their heads when they hear of this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse, explains.
And this is how one day, on a frisian farm, we come across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of a few millimeters thick has been used as a base to hold the roots of crops.
This is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine tissue lasts two seasons and then is thrown away.
For the library this fabric was presitated, for the first time in such quantities, until it gets plates four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mix of new car and sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and its ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment to the same that keeps the atmospheric humidity suitable for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it costs to believe it given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge pyramid of glass, even on the sunshine sun's sunrise only for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences located in a transverse direction to the glass facade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable inner climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic shutters.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptic worker in the information technology sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there, too.
Chinese traditional medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has also visited the library. She describes the "Boekenberg" as Spijkenisse's "late soul."
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical holes of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link to this building.
Everyone knows his book is part of the library.
Even if he's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a success in this reigning discipline that in specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity."
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uneducated it may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany abstained from the vote on Palestine's admission.
According to Stephen Szabo, a US relationship expert. This puts Berlin in a fairly tricky diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany implied that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer state status of the United Nations.
However, Berlin eventually abstained.
Why is that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
It has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, it is.
This is because it is currently reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they are still tempting their role to be, but they have already begun the path to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is strongly motivated in economic policy, i.e. in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other major powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
That is why it must be careful and not alienate Arab public opinion or Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't give it that much importance since it's not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US. Do you abstain from voting in important decisions like in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys a huge degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic break as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps with this Germany has managed to get some respect.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the U.S. The U.S. has been clearly in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the U.S. How many European nations are there?
There have always been such disparities because of American domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the true disparity of views does not really have the scale attributed to it.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all excited about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility to be part of a higher entity, but must push things forward from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it has with Israel.
This has always been a tricky subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take a leading role?
Or maybe you're still finding it hard to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to have a harder role to play.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as a main actor, certain anti-German feelings are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the U.S. The US in European policy is decreasing more and more, but the EU does not currently cover that vacuum, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to take a more leading role.
Even if they don't like it, if it's unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular town, c'est la vie.

'Camp Brand Protection' in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren is also a world-class.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name hides a name officially registered in China but which has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the real eponymous ones do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it is not clear that they will be given the reason.
"Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case arrives at my table.
The imitators simply add a couple of letters so they can register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of sports goods Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet that holds seats from the Beijing trademark office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that was also served from the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are department stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
But Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. On behalf of his clients, he is fighting against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a denomination that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan,"
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
Chinese authorities don't feel guilty
"It's detrimental to business, we have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand makes waters, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous."
Financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millions, especially in the case of luxury flagship products.
According to data from market analytics company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year China is, in size, the third largest luxury goods market and the one that grows at the highest rate.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can be extended to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long that the name the lawsuit had already become a "market reality."
"If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiver because the process has damaged the plagiarist's brand in China," Pattloch says.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that largely remembered BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to change it.
Clothing maker Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they have encountered difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the emergency situation at work returned to normal."
Thus, the number of unprocessed claims processes has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75 per cent more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain unresolved.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As is often the case in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, CTMO registered more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means China leads the list of new registrations around the world for the 10th consecutive year, according to the brand office.
This also seems to be the case with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been pocketed for rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as evidenced by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting a Chinese impersonator in court.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
The copycat has secured Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the appeal of the muniques.
Freudenberg has been given the reason in the next two instances, but the opposite side continues to fight today.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the gates of the High Court of Justice, where it is still pending.
Wentzler hopes to be able to resolve the issue favourably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files up to 100 years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing side a "ssum of six figures in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was not successful.
"This shows how much we care about," Wentzler says.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
Specifically if imitators are secured the rights to unprotected marks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long left this commercial sphere, however, it managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious when it comes to doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights law, but what needs to be done is "to register in China as well as everything that can be protected," as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the issue can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, in the event that Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license fees by his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg rehearses the Imbongi choir and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a link capable of exceeding much more than 6,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (contral, bass, tenor and soprano) slowly begin to rise, swirling, hindering and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his boxes almost as he tries to put order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music hall of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers, between 23 and 69 years old, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, every voice of the choir has a different text and also in a little known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations AIDS programme, there are approximately 34 million people worldwide infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found godparents in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
A child can be sponsored for 15 or 20 euros per month.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storyror" or "paneignist."
In this room no one knows how to speak this Bantu language fluently, but singing do know.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this gentle foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
1,833 kilometres away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a town called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest AIDS infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not welcome circumcision, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying at just over thirty years has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this remote population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but of the main: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the chances in a poor country are more than scarce.
Initially it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since professionally dealt with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial sTDs are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral sTDs are AIDS, the human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The crabs and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of those affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more often in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four in five cases of syphilis registered in Germany originate from sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, tricomonas, the human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungal) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its figure from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were recorded.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often cause no pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one protect you?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Some sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through dirty infections and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you often change as a sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, of the fees charged by the choir for its actions throughout Germany, they come to raise enough money.
"In total we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village Zodwa Dlamini herself, a self-confident and leading woman manages the money sent from Germany.
It is concerned that orphans find good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos," as the older women in Zulu are called, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof to live and care for children to go to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who are in charge of cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two chicken cookies and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the people's inhabitants to undergo HIV testing.
This is not obvious, since, despite the obvious fact that this disease is throughout the country, it is not usually openly talked about.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted lifestyle is largely responsible for the rapid spread that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless seasonal workers who travel the country from one side to the other and who take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact."
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many on the southernmost extreme of the African continent still recall from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to rip a couple of tears from some other rabid border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small population barely appears on the maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni it is well known.
"Come to Esitjeni, there the light shines," says locals.
And after traveling the 7,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the pace, you realize that it is also possible to see your light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 metres thick.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there is also icy water there, as can be seen from three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal "Science."
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that an ice sheet has formed in the area of the planet permanently in the shade.
It looks like this one is at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, with a high probability, from asteroids that once hit Mercury.
No one links the ice finding to the possibility of life on the planet, says Messenger probe chief investigator Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Completely inadvertently for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet."
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the hardest thing to recognize is the pink color of the "reborn" stars.
This star-forming region, named in a shallow manner by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopaea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This sunny image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The doughnut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits in its extinction process.
In the huge Trified Nebula, 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as the nickname "The Seven Sisters," are a visible object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a land continent has earned it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
This budding star could be captured in all its splendour for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It's probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace of 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Swirl Galaxy.
Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifida Nebula located several thousand light years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the term Latin "trifidus" (divided in three), since dark lines of dust divide the burning heart of this stellar formation area into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light years from Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of fusion jumped into each other to end up crashing irretrievably.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname of Austral Molinillo.
Photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The 1,400 light-year-old nebula is composed of dust particles that are between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a model moment for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the larger UGC 1810 spiral galaxy.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This stellar formation area constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosetta Nebula, new stars also continually emerge; 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, just gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when hydrogen could be found in the universe.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It appears the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and the images they offer us are getting more and more depth.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA. U.S., the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8,4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The drawback of this cheaper construction is that the telescope has a fixed lifting angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed lifting angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to gather light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope, researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
The "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 metres and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018, images are not expected to be taken.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is a picture of what it would look like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the beginning of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations leading up to the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers start from the basis that there is also ice at Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no credible evidence, as the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have been pointing to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that it is.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years

In southern Azerbaijan many people manage to reach biblical ages.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search for footprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great noise through the winding road that passes next to wooded hills, high-flow rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it's in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi," a town of which not much is known, apart from the fact that they perfectly dominate Persian and Azeri and are very long.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and does not seem to fit quite in such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely arrive at this place, as the road from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth the country enjoys thanks to the Caspian Sea oil has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what to have to be had to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May for the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the Elderly People in the World," says Fatulayeva.
This is the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here is the lives of eight dozen talyshis of the place who have reached 100 years of age documented. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son of his died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the shepherd of sheep, Isle Moss, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate certifying it.
And if we take into account that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Moslmov is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. She reportedly still had time to conceive a daughter at the age of 136.
Was it wrong then, so, did he go ally Mo in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at Rostock's Max Planck Institute, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, very elderly people also live," Scholz says, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; especially when there is no civil registration either.
Every day glasses filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly frequently, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azeri tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.
The museum's director, Ms. Fatulayeva believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich diet of the talyshi, which adore meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
Or maybe it's the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 he is relatively young for what is stylized by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, it tirelessly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and daughter, both of whom became grandparents a long time ago.
Two young children also jump from one side to the other.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that serves in typical glasses with a bulging shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long dark-haired braids that her son proudly discovers.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so it's never fallen off and kept its color.
"I've never used a shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never been shopping in my whole life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II season.
However, everything returned to its path when the "dear father," Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult professed to the fatherhood of the nation, who runs his country as a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, when the witness gave in to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's gray son is right: "In our culture the elders are very respected."
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the term "Human rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is plunged.
The future constitution, with sharia law as a basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president spared no jerk.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that happens is my responsibility, to the people and to God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all people, especially Christian Coptic, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
All of them, immersed without remedy so far in a confusing opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile for the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost apologizing, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his "to be able to save the revolution."
However, neither Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctoral degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law."
However, what does that mean of "principles"?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the room for legal maneuvering it carries, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new added article suggests: in all sharia issues it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great power in all Sunni Islamism.
It doesn't have to be so, but this may mean that clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the inability of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship, these courts served to exert a harsh repression of the opposition.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were being held in military prisons.
As set out in the draft, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values."
This is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it's nothing but censorship.
Certainly, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead another bans offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is unclear what an offense is and how it should be sanctioned.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that bans "offensing people"
Is a cartoon of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for signature and that, in his words, "very soon" he will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been closing ranks for weeks against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Cario's Tahrir Square and vowed to fail the Act before it can take effect.
"The revolution is back and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third on the presidential election lists.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution should be "in the trash bin of history."
Through Twitter, he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "state coup against democracy."
"When we convene the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow him," says opponent Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned," opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in the Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration; just in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, to Cairo University.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it to the cry of: "The people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded that Mursi "clean up the country," while proclaiming: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi's supporters did not want to risk something like this happening.
The Muslim brothers said that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now the time would have come to let the people decide in the polls what direction the country should follow.
In this regard, it seems that the draft Islamists is guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were being held in prison or had to face a trial during Mubarak's dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression "Human Rights" does not even appear in the new constitution," he laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag."
The extension of Mursi's powers to the three branches of state led this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against him.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: the most smelly fish in the world?
Norway's five million people enjoy one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has any bearing on its greed for a very smelly fish?
Take a series of over-cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is salted trout that is allowed to ferment in water during, depending on how smelly you prefer it, up to a year.
As it gets dark and gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy of the most, so to speak, captivating.
"You eat raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit from a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk," who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Every way we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking significant amounts of the drink.
"Soo people like aquavit more than rakfisk," Havard says.
The drink can kill the smell.
I'm chunks.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, not bad; it's not too much different to a portion of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, when poverty hit Norway and where, before refrigeration existed, fish was stored during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is removed and, evidently with the inactive senses due to alcohol, you eat.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive social services system.
A stream of people from Sweden, the old rival and even not too much richer than Norway, arrives in this country to work.
rakfisk is considered important, an essential, if quite smelly, part of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes to be bought.
But, in fact, it's all expensive. A beer reed or sandwich costs you the cool of 10o ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it to be so.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the July 22 event."
Norwegians find it very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own was able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's current wealth, there has been growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, as she goes through rakfisk trays and who, with her long blonde mane and striking blue eyes, she represents the image of Norwegian welfare.
"We are, as you say, prudent people".
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation".
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything except a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn't have during the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we're happy," Anna says.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a laughter.
I'm in the snow queuing to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is certainly something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, that smelly fish comes back.
The hotel I stay at is one of the many venues where a rakfisk dinner is held where diners vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A television has connected live with a bird-dry presenter who is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
Looks like the Eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard".
There's laughter and applause.
A man falls off the chair, perhaps beaten by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapours of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Pe√±a Nieto faces a tough start
As Mexico's incoming President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant analyzes the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today.
In a city that, in the best of circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the nation's management.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during Felipe Calder√≥n's outgoing government, but the country is engulfed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Pe√±a Nieto earlier this week to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
"I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal."
Before we meet with the US president, Mr. Pe√±a was governor of his home state, Mexico.
A very populated state with rapid growth, surrounding the capital; Opinions on the new leader are divided in this territory where he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents credit the growth of tourism on site and infrastructure construction.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Pe√±a Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and bumpy roads that were rehabilitated.
Plates with their name can also be seen at the entrance of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are confident that he will succeed in real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a deputy to Mr. Pe√±a Nieto, the PRI.
"Particularly, as far as security and the economy are concerned, we expect the interesting and real change our country so badly needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was overpowered by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Pe√±a Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition's qualification of lack of essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic man of state and, above all, he's a person who knows how to listen.'
On the other side of the state, however, that's not the impression many people have about its former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under stretches of high highway is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called for intervention to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighbourhoods and violence against women is particularly serious.
On a desert plot, next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pe√±a Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Ju√°rez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
The critics of Mr. Pe√±a Nieto says, at best, that he couldn't address the problem of femicide while in office.
The most critical accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buend√≠a has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I got home, it looked as if his body had been cleaned," Ms. Buend√≠a recalls.
'There were signs she had been beaten and the rigor mortis had already appeared.'
As his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross in which a single word is read: Justice.
However, that's exactly what the family say has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me like I'm an old gossip, a rioter, a whisker.
What they want is for you to simply accept what they say and shut up."
"But that can't be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence," he says.
The presidential band that President Pe√±a Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term.
"I hope he is the same kind of president that he was when he was governor," says PRI MP Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza most fear.
Bradley Manning did not report mistreatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with Bradley Manning's abuse allegations during his time in prison
Trial focuses on Manning's time at Quantico military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning's imprisonment was severe
The Army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now alleges he suffered while in military detention.
During the prosecution's interrogation of Manning at a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein said records of weekly visits of officers from the unit Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence's request for the dismissal of the case since his incarceration had been harsh and that this had already meant enough punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while in custody.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks posted the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico military prison, where he was imprisoned in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers reportedly asked Manning questions and scoring his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had described the treatment given to him by the wardens as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facility in general as "very professional."
The forms do not show any allegations of abuse, even though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the visiting officers had spoken about those problems and had indicated that they would be addressed, but that they did not record those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after talking about the problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean I wouldn't have mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not reported the treatment he received during the meeting in January 2011 with a council investigating suicide intentions he had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was.
The military said it had put him under that restrictive regime, which is below the basis of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure its protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was okay and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention ... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said the fact that he was not allowed to know what was going on with him or what was going on in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning said Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage".
Manning said that once he moved to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, some slippers, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming from outside pointing his eyes as he slept.
He said if the wardens couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to the Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about a plea he had made in Thursday's statement that, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced during a morning count to remain naked standing in front of the warden and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given a chance to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's cross-examination on Friday, Manning said he deduced by the order given to him by the warden that he should drop the blanket with which he could have been covered, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer he might have used the elastic of his underwear or his flip-flops to self-harm but had not.
Manning testified that that night his underwear, his flip flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he spent during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence in the event that he was convicted in the court martial, which is expected to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to misdemeanor and defending other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was held under the enforcement rules of any detainee who is in high custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally provoking the publication of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information and theft of property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remember Mexicans from those difficult times
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely gone down the esplanade and arrived at the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Posters indicated the way to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Extranjeros."
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I was supposed to go.
Having grown up in Central California, I have been called "Mexican" all my life.
This is about ethnic typography, just as my Boston friends refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italians."
Later I decided on "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, short-sightshots or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish. Good enough to handle me during an interview on this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and got in the queue of foreigners.
I thought at that time this week when Mexico's president-elect, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, it contained: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pe√±a Nieto was also looking forward to talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why a Mexican is now as likely to stay in Mexico as he ventures to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trading bloc in America.
In addition, Pe√±a Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of grudge.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think of centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, at a time when a U.S. official says anything that bears the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma are set on war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Shall we speak of grudge?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who were closed the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of study, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are their descenders and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Our identity may not be clear at times, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and they look at us over our shoulder as if we were in a lower category that isn't Mexican enough.
Our Spaniard will never be good enough and our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best in each country, but you're not rooted to any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexican.
Now, to complicate things even more, so I've learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as makeshift Mexico "ambassadors," representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much grudge.
And with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna be left alone with this idea, folks.
That's fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated much less long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the useless and usual discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything to pieces like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this will make your fight even bloodier than before.
However, there are reasons to think that his deadly impasse could unravel.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 is maintained, this week's clashes have reinforced the hawks on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has been well beaten.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on Gaza's 1.7 million inhabitants in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to wipe out Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals of Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could conclude that time plays in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence across the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a reborn regional powerhouse that had previously been Israel's closest Muslim ally, has embraced Hamas' cause. So has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Former Hamas members say the Islamist half-moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah party dominates, through Syria, where rebels from an increasingly Islamist tendency could topple Bashar Assad, to reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood is cousins brothers of Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist who cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel's hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
On the military issue, they have put Hamas in place.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proved effective and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep quieter... for some time.
As for diplomacy, the U.S. is firmer than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part thanks to the barrier corrosed by the West Bank, the main piece of territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to rise even though, under international law, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even tougher line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, is in a good position.
Why pamper these twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and hit them a good hit if they raise their heads.
The hard wing may be imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Even if Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Initiating a war with the area's superpower will hardly help new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should think long term, too.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a dustbin that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The crackdown is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics make the situation worse as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay a growing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one proclaimed by sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and Israel's transfer of territory for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to the people of others who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin curbing the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented position to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the matter should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to devote his attention to him.
This attitude is a deplorable vision for the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The generic tobacco packaging law goes into effect in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and body parts with diseases look on boxes of a green black, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australian tobacco and generic packaging law, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colours of brands with a wrap of an olive green blackout, appalling images of body parts with illnesses and depictions of sick children and babies being children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the various health images and warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, is the names of the brands, all printed on a small source type.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government says the aim is to deter young people from smoking by removing the traits that make this habit glamour.
He trusts studies that show that if a person hasn't started smoking before age 26, there's a 99% chance he'll never do it.
"You can see that boys, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect multinational profits too much, other countries are considering taking similar action.
The tobacco industry has put enormous pressure on the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would boost the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say their business has benefited after the law was passed.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the demand for cigarettes and silicone covers to cover the nasty images of the boxes had skyrocketed almost since zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
The lady. He said Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was expecting more stock.
"It's a good business for us".
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social media among the demographic sector to which the plan is addressed.
After a series of Australian laws banning advertising on television and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has gone online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you market tobacco and you only have this little window to promote your products, online space is the most compelling place to be in," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman saw an increase in reviews of brands from "walking citizens" posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if it's just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or if any marketing companies are behind it.
Australia's British American Tobacco said the industry is focused more on what new regulations mean than on marketing.
Industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules; these countries are asserting to the World Trade Organization that trade is being restricted unfairly, even though none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers are challenging in Australia.
"The photographs don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them.'
"You take the cigarette and save the package," says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in central Sydney, says uniform boxes make it harder for him to put them on the shelves.
"It was usually an hour to undevelte a delivery; now it took four," Yu says.
"The government should have completely banned tobacco and then that's it, that's it, okay, it's over and we close the store," he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get bored.
During this year's Thanksgiving holidays, unexpectedly I had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not forgetting duty-free stores.
But more and more children's development academics and experts praise the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it is okay that both we and our children are bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since, at present, most of us are connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we take boredom in good spirits?
Yes, yes.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" says, "The Bored, an Animated Story") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin on boredom dating back to the 1st century A.D.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a wide variety of ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining published research and raising the idea to a panel of discussions of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "unleaning, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you."
He says the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person doesn't do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the care process, associated with a low mood and a sense that time passes slowly."
Boredom can sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that while they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what really happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," published in the September edition of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading the journal article.
Some groups listened in the adjoining room to a full-volume television show that had no relationship, others listened to it with the low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the show with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; they had a hard time concentrating, but they weren't sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom," Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
'On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting faulty pieces in a manufacturing line, music that distracts you can help you not to bore yourself."
"In fact, we currently know that moving or scribling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, as they make that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more in a tendency to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a "burning trend scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes issues like "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that I'm interested in I don't have time to do it all."
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using such scales, researchers have found that boys have a more tendency to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more varied.
But, in general, teenagers are a kind of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by search.
He found 32 percent of teens said they were bored while at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest levels," largely because both children and teenagers are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, going back to my question from the beginning: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as placing bets or falling into the consumption of substances as a method of combating it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the issue for more than two decades.
"Great is the brain's way of telling you you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's appropriate.
If you're bored and use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may no longer be bored, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or two himself," says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dose applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but learns to better control himself in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable apart from the constant rumour of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is too distressing and unsettling a desire to relate to something worth it," he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: No instruction book for new marijuana use law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community high school and footballer in southeastern Colorado, faces criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal across the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and a time later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor offences that each carry a fine of 100 U.S. dollars) informing him of the trial date.
"They treat us like criminals," says Orozco.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of misdemeanor felony for possession of marijuana are being overturned both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped pressing charges against those over 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law has come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's most conservative districts have vowed to go ahead with the cases opened for marijuana possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the recently opened of marijuana tents, authorized, in their communities.
"All of this is changing so quickly I don't know what will be next," Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of the regulations in Washington state are also turning the issue around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of licences for production, manufacturing, distribution and sale; all before the deadline, December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado is ahead of most states in terms of regulating marijuana use, first for terapestic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what could work.
"There is no real precedent that serves as a model for us," he says.
The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, which also leaves a year during which will be swimming between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as maintaining a balance between the state's demand to offer "adequate access" to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of cannabis business within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
"Nowhere will it be harder to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Legal Cannabis Center, a research group recently created.
On November 21, Oates, Aurora's police chief, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would stop bringing legal action for minor misdemeanours for possession of marijuana to people over 21 and that the police would stop pressing charges against these crimes "with immediate effect."
Police Chief Oates said they would be in charge of enforcing the city's regulations that regulate the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and would continue to pursue drug dealers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those misdemeanours that were made at the time they occurred were a crime," Mr. Buck in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on marijuana legalization.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer summon adult for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported the decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases of possession.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time doing law enforcement until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing marijuana use for recreational use to within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier with district attorneys," says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents the defendants for marijuana possession and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of the Marijuana Law.
"It's been so long taking people to court that they can't really accept it being legal yet," he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become national testing cases in terms of drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving guidance from the federal government, which still provides for consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization are hopeful the Justice Department will give in.
Although there have been some high-profile arrests of patients and marijuana sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales businesses to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"Who it's likely that anti-drug agents won't throw doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they'll probably be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores to run for sale of marijuana for recreational use, allowed in the new law," Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking for what the community voted in the face of voting for what the state voted for."
Many questions arise about it.
Petronella Wyatt: 'I was harassed until I got kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory'
College students are not attacked for their views only now
I don't remember any time in my life when I haven't been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after taking up my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue a history race, I had already packed, triggering the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed I had quit because I did not tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson jokingly announced that I had left because I was forced to drink in disatched mugs.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason, which in the cradle of the supposed illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative party.
Maybe they'll wonder what that's about now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students are suffering from a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of Conservative party students is such that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (graduate student group) at Corpus Christi College say they are "often seriously removed, personally attacked and treated as unpleasant people" because of their political ideas.
They want to create a seat on their college's equal opportunity committee to make sure they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favoured by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and presenting the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
He showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with the silver grip.
At other universities, Conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice-chairman of the Conservative Party Association at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student in Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cherill, 19, and president-elect of the OUCA, says the attitude of JCR members towards people who are centre-right has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first weeks at Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former pupil, a "honoris cause" degree following cuts to higher education funding.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist shudder.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I discovered that the professors not only turned a blind eye to the mob that was made of conservative college students, but participated in it willingly.
The policy of the miners' strike, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the wooden rooms of the seminary.
The first I attended was to be translated into English by French texts of the 18th century and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I didn't give one.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like a lumpy mass, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Does thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they simply fools?" he asked.
The other college students laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy knowing people," Pitt grunted.
I went back to my room like a soul in pain.
That night I sat alone at dinner time at college; then I felt a slight pat on the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be Labour."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardly to disguise.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Ms. Thatcher.
That trick proved useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated".
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" one asked.
"They beat each other up, don't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal 1960s law.
Could you one day lead a normal life in Oxford?
Will you be forced to meet people who thought like me only after nightfall?
Did I have to become Labour and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years I expected were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.
They hated him for being not only the Conservative party, but also Thatcher's adviser on foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was barely there.
He hated the place because he considered him provincial and insignificant and for his adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he told me.
I began to move daily from Oxford to my parents' house in London, finding refuge in my family and friends with a more open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
'They'd never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His sore eyes began to cloud.
"Give it another chance.
I'm sure they've done it just to joke.
My heart would break if you left it."
Overwhy from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had given up his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had hinted, speaking totally seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Red of embarrassment inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "stupid old people."
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
At the time my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was inside huddled with fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed up and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weeping.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative party but, to this day, hide behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing," which opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, a former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Sewing," a retrospective apothesian that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by their "maison" for the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascination with the weeng, distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most large of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from humble modity to the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to an idol of the international "jet-set."
Being in love with royalty is nothing wrong with it.
"At least they don't turn off their cigarettes" butts on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to their chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate with forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charism of the hysteria.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner for his flat.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything one looked and felt its spirit.
"Each guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model," which began working with him during the Paris High Sewing Week in 1995.
"It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art," he says.
Alcurnia parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-reciprocated loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre-long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the role of the models and must parade along the catwalk to contemplate a dream "hearing" that looks like Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte," or a coat of wool and skin that perish He told Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of mannequins shine names such as that of Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the dyes, in 2006
Many of those clients say the first Valentine is like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trouser, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he made to me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Fair.
I really like the colors it uses, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergtampoo can forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting old and the opportunity to wear one of his outfits at night...
Finally, the time came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with a flying skirt, "corsage" druffed and cleavage word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dress party dresses with "maximum care ... because a dress isn't just a dress, it's also the set of memories that comes with."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the dressmaster calls its seamstresses) to make that ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a milestone of haute couture from the late 20th century, "the return of high society clients."
Obfused for years with the "savoir-Etre" of the elite, Valentino is now his best exemplary.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the spouses of her clients.
"I have always been struck by his refinement, his calm, his neat appearance and perfect," D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"I was flawless, time doesn't go on for him".
If a princess says so...
The toughest trade in the world: Kawah Ijen's human mules
For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano play their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone trails
There are people for whom their work is hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who make a living taking sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to go down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from the Earth's bowels solidifies when it comes into contact with the air.
After tearing large brimstone rocks, which in total, they weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two baskets of bamboo that he carries on his shoulders through steep stone trails.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb at turtle step, keeping the balance and measuring with tempting their steps so as not to slip and falling down the cliff.
They know that any swing could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who was fired years ago by the cliffs of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro for every kilo of sulphur they extract
Once upstairs, they make their way among tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, griously carrying the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has operated the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) for every kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As normal is to load 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily carries.
It takes three hours each and ends up ground, but allows you to raise 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems like a misery to such an inhumane effort, it's three times what I would earn on the field.
"The miners' day is very high here, where coffee harvesting is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) on a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros) ," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a buser on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the cut was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a compelling reason that, in Indonesia, is as blunt as sulphur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At 27, Anto has been playing three on the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already begun to bill him despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this nice and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden hut with other porters, it rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater by lighting up with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
Some 400 porters carry sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its penguin benefits, the mining company has not machined sulphur extraction to save costs or supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and so much the weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of surcharge per camera that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for the beasts and not for people," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old porter who has been in the Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
Able to raise up to 110 kilos, he says he'll hold on working "everything he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged between 18 and 10.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sulphur burns the throat and squeaks its eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that none complain of serious diseases... beyond, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pains in the knees and sores in the shoulders, which have been misinformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on her back, Unainik can already only carry 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions start 15 tons of sulphur to the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat road between the weed.
"I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims opening his mouth well, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the elder, 30, also works carrying sulphur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the toughest trades in the world: the one made by the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress and cost of property and education for not having children.
"Singapore's people need to grow up."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and we create life.
It may seem implausible that these verses are part of a mint pill ad, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (bun) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hopeful that with the ad they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music so that people do "their national duty."
This is purely the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt this was an issue we had to address.
We knew the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing fast dating evenings (speed-dating).
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2 - known as a replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Division, says it's because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise of singleness, and delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia abounds barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese immigrants, who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore's governing party experienced its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with quotas and higher charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has gone on to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe-cup" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have 46 square metre areas and have had a lot of sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote a lifestyle of singles and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of real estate company EL Developers, says its "shoe box" sells much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units run out days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step toward raising the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the downtown financial district seems not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are putting it off," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government is trying to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
The private offline is private online
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of private or "the area of private life that you have the right to protect from any interference."
What is private to a child under 16?
How does this definition apply to your daily life and social networks?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed by ventilating on the Internet situations you probably wouldn't share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys between the ages of ten and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine," on the personal level, and "in the user's key and name," when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets wouldn't upload them to a post," says 10-year-old Jorge, as he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can meet them, but not everyone," he says.
In FB I upload nice or play images.
I am also entertaining myself with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or of someone who's making a fool of yourself," he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photographs of naked people, of crimes or writing humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to meet the 35 friends he has in FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened up Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I just put them up," he adds.
"Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't listen to anyone to recommend a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teenager holds open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admitting not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, none of them have been insinuated or asked for the address of his home or phone number.
"If they pressured me or demanded it, I just take them off my account," he acknowledges.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"I never knew who he was," he says.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"He just gave him privacy".
Then explain a series of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
If I did, if I like it or I feel like it.
"Even though I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents it should be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites they changed the rules of the game," he says.
Porras points out that the academic Marc Prensky, a master's degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Native and Immigrants Digital, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He says the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite criterion on what should or should not be disseminated, published or said at an age that maturity does not give for that."
"Also that they are selective when what matters most to them is being popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do so is no good," he adds.
Here, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like to see them post a picture of you like the one you posted of a friend?
You know what the others post about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people for permission to label them?
And one more, do everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"One off the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, it must still be on social media," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says it is essential for parents to read social media policies conscientiously.
By understanding each of the paragraphs they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers."
The Summit of Unasur concludes without making the Lima Declaration public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven leaders attending.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources of Foreign Ministry and Presidency initially pointed out that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but then stated that it will be published at some point on the Peruvian Government's website.
When consulted by the text, they pointed out that the content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio."
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is Humala's pronouncement, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of the South-Arab America (ASPA), and on that occasion, although it was required insistently by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was also not disseminated.
On the official ASPA website it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that there were transmission systems secured for all journalists but limited the maximum to obtaining information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court that would give a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will end and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean pair.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," Pi√±era added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogot√° by which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international court, following a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the in attendances of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Ch√°vez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 following the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects between the South American countries totalling $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenry for which we are expanding the residence agreements."
He reported that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-priced Internet access in all corners of South America, and to respond jointly and efficiently to the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must serve to expand our productive matrix and glimpse a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas...untiating our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although it did not give further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve its reinstatement to the Union of South American Nations," of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another issue highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before beginning his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan pair, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat in a respectful way the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogot√°.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) you may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua is going to require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell him to handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc's defense ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans "killed each other in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
In this regard, he defended the project to establish the South American citizenship that the Unasur member countries encourage.
"We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers by any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also expressed himself in favor of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San Jos√© pact on human rights.
Those who give chair never commit to anything and, on the other hand, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said in reference to Ecuador's political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he is not sorry for that decision because he has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his process was not respected."
He also criticized the Swedish court for demanding that he submit to his territory for interrogation for an alleged sexual offence when "Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there is a risk of Assange's physical and mental health deteriorating.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that I had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
What there is is is the danger of his physical and mental health deteriorating because he is locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
"That complicates anyone's health," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting a savior to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the lock-up of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word is not used in this case, but there have been ongoing talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garz√≥n, is doing a number of procedures in different European bodies," he said.
And he said that "if Britain gives the safe conduct tomorrow it ends."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow this problem ends.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and nuanced that what he does not tolerate is "medicity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he welcomed the fact that it is no longer these journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador," and he said that if he is re-elected "it will deepen the revolution to continue the path and the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coupling clothed with legality" because in reality it "shattered the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that ruling is not in place.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They must be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move on.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the maritime boundary litigation they hold in the same court Peru and Chile and said that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries undertake to accept judgment however harsh it may be."
Referring to the eventuality that he presents himself as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 election, he will withdraw from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as that of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My post-monic movement thought it was me who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
If I won it would be my last term in the presidency and from there we leave public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that he was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse in President Chavez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
Deaths in Silk today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: positive AIDS.
"It was like a bomb dropped on me," he says in remorseing the timing of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "softer," without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness only and began to learn about it; with such an effort that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut."
Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, unaware of his illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "exhausted" his immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who initiates treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affectation of the immune system presented by patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, this means that anyone who receives the diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25, under these terms "as long as he remains in control he will be able to live without problems until the age of 75," the interviewee explained.
To dimension this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths go until May this year; however, it is ensured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it happened in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we haven't had a drug out of the problem, the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He said a blunt fact: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection, what has to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, mass detection tests have to be offered to all people who require it."
His proposal coincided with specialists and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to get the test in a particular laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done so and, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'll be better stirred three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was to get better, I eat well, I exercise, I take the medications.
To date, her parents only know she had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anybody else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I take care of myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his privacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
That they take the test, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, is better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, your message, summarizes the battle motto to AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Great are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapat√≠o journalist who has taken on the cause about HIV.
And the biggest is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "effectively the distribution of condoms has increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packets of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those today, still, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, with sorna and value judgments of social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to expose themselves, the communicator said.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that the condoms are not only behind the counters and those hundred are in public bathroom dispatchers from the sites frequented by young people.
It's not motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz√°lez replied, when asked if there would be condom distribution in his administration.
"That's not how sexuality is, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th cases of HIV.
92% of the infections are the sexual route, 6% to the blood pathway and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV because in a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. appeals court a judgment that does not know the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group achieved through a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario places a dire precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures in the endorsement of the survival of the signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In the practical terrain, the backlash to the sentence issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the North District of Texas leaves Mexican firms helpless in the face of the possibility of seizing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the door for Mexico's main glass manufacturer to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies.
In the end, while the judge in the case states that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says the main procedure is the commercial contest processed in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnationally profiled companies.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Standardization of International Trade Law was established towards this purpose, placing the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts owed to their parent company by the subsidiaries of Vitro, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway Vitro's creditors who fought against it in the United States Courts, that is, the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
The data is omitted from the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 to the severe economic crisis facing the United States, sticking the scoop to the country.
For the time being, the signing of the Gonz√°lez Sada family will file an appeal for reconsideration with the appeals court itself for the vote to reach the plenary of the appeals court, i.e. the five judges, since only three voted.
If this does not succeed, Cerciorare's appeal that requires a higher instance review of the process will be claimed, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The serious thing about the case is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government under the guise amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Competitions Act, noting that it was unloaded in accordance with the agreements signed by both countries to tie it with chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country folded to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambola of two bands: Vitro beat and beat the country.
General balance sheet

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Cassy has been my life"
Basketball fans Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of the board and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
Before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was a minor player, National Superior Basketball player, owner and leader in the BSN with the Bayamon Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I put on a lot of hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamon, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Call has been my life".
Kings don't exaggerate in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorableness that denote his wide trajectory, testify.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, the ones he treasures with the greatest emotion are those who recall his time with the Cowboys from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old serving as co-sars or the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, whether as a proxy, co-staker or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at the BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz took over, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had led here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have you a very strong player, 6"7" tall.
You want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was Nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring in another one.
The Cowboys championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already in the distance, because by 1988 it was already of federal mandamas.
By that time he preferred to enjoy his executioners and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the 1989 Pre-Olympic in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth and it must have been bronze if not for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup group the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as is the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave the United States team a peel, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the World Cup.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L√≥pez and "Picul√≠n" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "To√±ito" Col√≥n and James Carter young, the Lion brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuqu√©n, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner to replace the players suspended by the Pan American mess of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
What has been Puerto Rico's best player?
Undoubtedly, that was Picul√≠n Ortiz.
His numbers at international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as did Picul√≠n.
And that doesn't count his trajectory in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Mel√©ndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I would have liked to implement, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, that Ponce's boys only played in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now the children travel and play too unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officers and referees.
I'm pleased with that.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and from time to time go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas," in which he embodied an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predator oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, he has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon from complications of cancer, according to a statement from the family provided to The Associated Press by the Warner Bros., the home of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again representing the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I'll miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted he had drunk heavily for years.
In 1995 he was found with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," broadcast on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at home.
She also starred in two comedies that were short on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included roles well received by critics in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his ultimate stardom.
CBS's dramatic series on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was on the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.??," designed to generate expectation around an episode of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars in betting houses.
He also helped give the series a record audience at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and turned "Dallas" into the second most-watched entertainment show in history, behind the 1983 end of "MASH," which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to label her a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt insatiable with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be hospitalized.
"I know what I want on J.R."s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only one negotiated he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, on Friday recalled Hagman as someone "enormous, on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
Recording five of the chapters for the second season had already been completed and a sixth was in the process, the network reported.
There was immediately no pronouncement from Warner or TNT on how the series will handle Hagman's loss.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when he had it in 1931 during his marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatrical stages of New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't put anything there that I thought was going to hurt someone or affect them in some way," he told Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant he became an advocate of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they're going to be fine."
She was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
They start course exploring the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charm√© decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clung as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charm√© had no idea what was waiting for him in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called "debt-dered" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end of the times believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has ever been," Charm√© told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you look at what's been going on in the world today like we're 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last in history.
In Temple, Associate Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide some human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled only "The End of the World."
"We don't add '2012' to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin," students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the same night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses proved quite popular.
"It was saturbated in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, claim that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old career student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing career student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - let alone a teacher - said he believed in the December 21 expiry date.
"Our first project was about Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, a senior student at Temple, 21, from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he said there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, when people react to the changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge in these speculations.
"On other sides people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at an exception to a higher authority.
We have a Pope's pardon.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final trial, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start thinking immediately about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to parties "from the end of the world."
"Maybe I'll call some friends to laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
