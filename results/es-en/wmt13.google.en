A Republican Strategy to Block Obama&#39;s Re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
Now, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and claims that voter fraud is less prevalent in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: those new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, the American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And along the same lines, a majority of American governments enacted, as of 2009, new laws that made the registration or voting process difficult.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, in 2011, 180 bills were introduced that restricted the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
New electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the count, and remove citizens with criminal records from voting.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present a photo ID.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
For this reason, the Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as a Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 do not have an identity document with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
As a result, the new restrictions disproportionately affect youth, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people who earn less than $ 35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have An identity document with a photograph.
And there are still more.
In many states, students, the voters who vote the most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to file such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It appears that two out of every three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers in 2011 supported certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day as the ballot in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who wanted to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration drives contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
Actions taken since 2009 caused the new voter registration rate to drop in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that favored shortening the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida elections, 33% of early voters were African-American, while early voters represented no more than 13% of the state&#39;s voters.
In the case of Hispanics, it was exactly the same.
They do not represent more than 11% of voters, which is equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, represent no more than 46% of citizens who vote early.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fervently opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this sense, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The United States Attorney&#39;s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of voting rights in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed, since it is clear that they are intended to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have adopted such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: those new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: To Get Tested or Not?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to carry out useless medical interventions.
It&#39;s more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant in themselves, doubt whether or not they should get screening tests.
Take the test or not?
We have asked two specialists for advice.
In studies conducted in the United States, a high rate of infections was detected among the sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with a 12-year follow-up, also showed that there is a 30-40% chance of metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
African-American men have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is found.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer. You should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that are not life threatening in the long term, in which case you should rather opt for active disease surveillance.
Today, many men who have been found to have cancer are not treated, since this cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a risk to their life.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We are increasingly determining precise criteria to decide who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that you take the test in any case.
But it is important that you speak with your doctor to determine whether or not you should have the test.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits is still the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved around enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
&quot;If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%,&quot; stresses André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we assess that about 10% of cancers are inherited.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly damages people&#39;s health.
&quot;Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; said spokesman André Beaulieu.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is cut in half.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
&quot;Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer,&quot; they add.
feeding
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they escalate the risk of colorectal cancer.
Delicatessen products should also be avoided.
Preserving meat for smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
&quot;They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; they explain.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment their research is inconclusive.
According to the SCC, the studies on vitamin E are conflicting.
While in one of them a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer was found, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of discussing each one&#39;s concerns and family history with their doctor.
&quot;Testing does not cause cancer.&quot;
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed, in effect, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
What&#39;s more, it is the particle whose existence the Standard Model predicted: our best or &quot;least bad&quot; explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is the Higgs.
We know without a doubt that a new particle exists and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data is still missing to be completely sure.
In any case, we assume that it is Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem small. We will see what it is about.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and don&#39;t try too hard, because you will end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot;; a &quot;state&quot; that consists, roughly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And on the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Laboratories&#39; The Particle Adventure website, which, by the way, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we will not talk about here, and &quot;force particles&quot;, by which large forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it should be emphasized here, are not the exotic critters we might believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the &quot;particle of light&quot; that acts as a &quot;messenger&quot; of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it &quot;messes up&quot; the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this &quot;disorder&quot; an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing more than a photon; that is, one of the &quot;force-carrying&quot; bosons.
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be &quot;disordered&quot; for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it, it is necessary to reach extremely high energies, a bit as if it were an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide across the surface.
That is why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN&#39;s (the large hadron collider is a 27 km circumference ring!) To achieve such energy levels.
The electromagnetic field analogy is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don&#39;t: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to a fridge by itself.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, what &quot;can all this research contribute&quot;? Asks Mrs. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between MS observations and predictions.
For their part, many fervently want to meet, as the slightest difference could open a door to a &quot;new physics&quot; that plugs certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation related to gravity (oops!) Or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the Universe (oops!).
But we have not found such differences at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of such research on our day-to-day lives are difficult to predict, but we do not think we are wrong in saying that it will not have any.
Just so you see: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in labs were not at all suspicious of the revolution their work would bring about.
They glimpsed the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, said, at first the laser was rather considered a &quot;laboratory apparatus&quot;.
Imagine ...
And in addition, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the investigation.
For example, Willard Boyle himself made a light collector in 1969 in the course of his research on optics.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this sensor now serves as an &quot;eye&quot; for all digital devices in the world, earning him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that you never know ...
Palliative care. The best way to die ... | Le Devoir
In its Dying in Dignity Commission, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon while a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Le Devoir has tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment on the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year respite.
&quot;They had given me five years to live, but I have been that way for seven,&quot; he recounts, made a raisin, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois hospice in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
&quot;But it&#39;s always a shock, we can&#39;t be prepared for this,&quot; he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: an enormous weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he resignedly accepts that they help him eat.
Brave, he even smiles, talks to strangers who pay attention to him, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
&quot;My greatest wish is that they cure my diarrhea, it is humiliating,&quot; he confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for this problem.
&quot;In the course of our lives we learn that a man pees standing up,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Going back to their childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
&quot;That depends on the ability of the person to accept this regression,&quot; he notes.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering Victor-Gadbois hospice have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer &quot;curative&quot; care.
The 89-year-old Ms A.&#39;s greatest fear is dying &quot;conscious and drowning.&quot;
But the disease has made him discover his children.
&quot;I have good children,&quot; he adds.
&quot;I have no more wishes in this life,&quot; she says, before agreeing to have a mask put on to help her breathe.
And she hopes, in the next few days, one last visit from her son who lives in Italy.
At Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, care of the body and help with food are offered.
It is palliative care that is given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have one hospice bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that we will all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand.
Diabetics no longer have their blood sugar controlled.
Death is part of the everyday.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer, who died during the night.
This morning, his son finished his beer at the feet of the deceased.
&quot;We help both patients and their loved ones,&quot; says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At the Victor-Gadbois center the days go by without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man savoring his last family gathering on the patio, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, having tried everything to survive.
&quot;For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 suffering from cancer,&quot; worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in hospital or in a center care.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Grand Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize almost exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative lack of healthcare in Quebec that makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec healthcare system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before euthanasia is agreed to proceed.
&quot;Recently,&quot; she says, &quot;I have seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER suffering great pain without having done what is necessary to relieve it.
I fear that patients want to die just because they don&#39;t receive proper care. &quot;
And in parallel, many oncologists persist with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
Hélène Richard&#39;s hopes of survival were already low when she left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
&quot;When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting,&quot; she says.
&quot;However, she had told me that there was nothing else to do!&quot;
There are no almighty cares
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request to die thank their caregivers who have not responded to their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to pain management.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which is used to put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: &quot;I want to die.&quot;
But that does not necessarily mean &quot;I want euthanasia&quot;, but rather &quot;I want to be relieved.&quot;
This report was made possible thanks to a journalism grant from the Canadian Health Research Institutes.
Wide-ranging real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, businessmen of the BTP, fund-raisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell, day after day, what they know of a formidable &quot;system&quot;, of which the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and gangsters.
An &quot;industry&quot; that was too expensive for Québec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
&quot;It is curious how the system is pulverized once we have hunted the big media&quot;, jokes Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, made possible by an in-depth investigation into embezzlements tied to road contracts in Quebec, which the liberal prime minister at the time, Jean Charest, had only agreed to delay.
The &quot;Duchesneau report&quot; established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding, and corruption among officials.
&quot;Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, the transport ministry alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts,&quot; containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission &quot;has already brought down two mayors,&quot; he adds, while he hopes to be able to &quot;demonstrate the existing stratagems behind individuals.&quot;
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also applied with its team of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
This unit functions in addition to the policemen of &quot;the Marteau squad&quot;, who, since 2009, have caused the Montreal &quot;sewer cartel&quot; to moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to the serial registration of accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec&#39;s third city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly pocketed bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers from the Montreal road network and businessmen of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been indicted.
The latter has caused a stir by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the &quot;system&quot; for obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal for three years to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito distributed money left and right during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power.
He also admitted to having organized an illegal fundraiser for the former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes from companies in the construction sector totaling $ 736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other officials of the road network have admitted that they received money for inflating the invoices between 30% and 40% in concept of false extras.
In addition, an organizer for the mayor&#39;s party, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of having deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November, leading Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politicians in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, since 2010 she has opposed the sale of a municipal land acquired for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money
Of the investigation that will finally be carried out, she assures that she pulls &quot;a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and to catch the culprits.&quot;
And he adds that the process is &quot;painful, but positive.&quot;
We are cleaning the wounds but it would take a clean investigation unit in Montreal and be very vigilant so that the dubious practices are not repeated.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that &quot;officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars&quot;, but he is especially concerned about the role of &quot;elected politicians aware of the ploy.&quot;
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was destined to the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically: &quot;I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality.&quot;
The Québec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $ 100, but that will not change the donation, according to him, &quot;as long as electoral spending is not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics.&quot;
He recommends a complete review of the system for granting public contracts and party financing: &quot;we cannot fall any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on a more solid basis, with more controls and laws &quot;.
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look at themselves in the mirror.
&quot;PSG is not FC Barcelona!&quot;
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain this advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I go from day to day by his side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a match, that is easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don&#39;t get hot.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training center to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by leaps and bounds.
You will profit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer&#39;s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every workout is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He&#39;s backed by attachments like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man the team needed?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect in all the coaches.
Today, there is no one like him in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think it will take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken the leading position from us.
But we are still in ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the round of 16 in style.
What is the objective of the club in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say against many very good European teams.
We want, to begin with, finish the first of our league against Porto to be able to receive the second leg of the round of 16.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You already have the budget ...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long haul.
Today, that is not the case.
On an economic level, the PSG is dedicated to its means so that this project is carried out.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it constitute a great failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
In the last season we did not get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions ...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expect more from PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we beat Troyes 4-0 at home, that they still come across things to reproach us with is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We try to start a game project.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, have failed to qualify for the round of 16, and they too have invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with a 15-point advantage for the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been &quot;boosted&quot; by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better that we say that we have a &quot;Zlatandependencia&quot;.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and scores a lot of goals.
He has come to show that he is the star of League 1.
And he has shown in all the teams he has gone through that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How have you lived Euro 2012 with the French team?
It has been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this European Championship.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and came out strengthened.
Today I can play good games for the national team.
It is what I expected since my baptism with the &quot;bleus&quot;.
We learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine and this is why today we have exemplary behavior.
What is your vision of Didier Deschamps&#39; first month leading the &quot;bleus&quot;?
You are getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires them to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don&#39;t want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the Eurocup.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the team to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) on October 16 in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Each one fought for all.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of current currency exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Furthermore, as is often the case in technology, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is simultaneously a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file sharing.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been registered thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after having reached the peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to 2 dollars five months later, before today returning to around ten dollars (the prices are registered on the bitcoincharts page .com).
It is not at all impressive when compared to world changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as &quot;the most successful virtual currency,&quot; &quot;competing with the dollar or the euro,&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies.&quot;
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as &quot;credits&quot;, used to advance in a video game and that can be won by playing or can be bought (and sometimes even redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in all exchanges a central authority controls and deals with the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously ledgers, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually done between two electronic addresses in the form of email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are recorded in the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is writing that new transaction in that book.
This passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge thrown at the computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a file slicing phase, that is, the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
Computers &quot;catch&quot; the new transaction and add a number before &quot;slicing&quot; the set.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular fingerprint (plus leading zeros).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would be orphaned, since they both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided in two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins on deposit stolen.
&quot;The failure used does not affect the same protocol,&quot; says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Big players like Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November the &quot;giant sales&quot; were launched.
&quot;$ 30,000 was exchanged,&quot; rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology as well as in the network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are therefore cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to supply an address that a phone can &quot;photograph and recognize&quot;, says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of the hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
&quot;It will take a while for Bitcoin to take hold, but in 2013 there could be a change,&quot; he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report the ECB plans to revalue the various risks, now considered high, should this currency be successful.
We have left Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of their territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, expecting nothing from us.
We have particularly punished the Afghan peasants, whom we have seen as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former chiefs refugees in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be tolerated when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the almond-planted hills thanks to French credits, was done in order.
The truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban into Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible breakthrough between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants outnumbered by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share a desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into speculators, seizing government land to resell it as lots for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge US outsourcing contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
The people, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have taken advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived through the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of both girls and boys.
We will have to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is hungry for mobile phones. Turkish television and its serials depicting a modern world have huge fans across the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, suppressing the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has relied on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has reestablished its services, no reservoirs have been fixed, or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumors spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to get hold of them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper ores from the ground and without means of transportation to export them across the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mines, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the immense buddhic site and remain there as the province&#39;s top employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country on which imports and exports largely depend, will also need to reestablish their normal relations.
The French troops left on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls &#39;schools, boys&#39; schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to &quot;win hearts and spirits&quot; and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of &quot;civil and military actions&quot; of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), Suppressed in 2012, it brought and brought in, through a small French NGO, numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain towns.
Those jobs, eager to obtain local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, solar protection and increase in cultivated areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will help improve local living conditions, which are very harsh in those valleys often located more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civil aid that reaches them directly.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever on the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to play everything for everything.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on his final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And Egypt has been using a provisional text for almost two years, modified several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial muddles.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his &quot;autocratic delusion&quot; and continues to &quot;betray his word&quot; and &quot;trample the law.&quot;
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis more quickly and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be organized in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this resource has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: &quot;either vote for my text or I keep full powers&quot;, powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, the vast majority Islamist, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, a little before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt that they could not enforce their points of view.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 substitute members were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As might be expected, the articles voted unanimously.
Commentators are amused, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the clock of the Constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the object of all eyes, remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that &quot;Sharia principles constitute the main source of law.&quot;
The Salafi parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that &quot;the principles&quot; could be replaced by &quot;the norms&quot;, which would have allowed a stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing more than a publicity stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm their conformity with Sharia laws.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because &quot;the people called to speak out are not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy. &quot;
Liberal fears are further increased by the fact that the next rector of said university would be considerably less moderate than the current one.
&quot;For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulama but university students, some of them trained in the French system &quot;, explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, as the terms used mimic religious vocabulary.
&quot;We are referring specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could be posed in the future would be to what extent are civil judges competent to rule on all this. &quot;
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to what they were during the previous regime.
Another sticking point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the revision of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Neither will the prosecutions of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by the associations for the defense of human rights.
They also showed their concerns regarding the text, which they consider liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy continues and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
Furthermore, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to appear on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
&quot;IDA&quot; identified the top five reasons why you should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this &quot;baptismal font&quot; will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the full nets.
In this same place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the largest number of holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers here walk the Stations of the Cross or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin &quot;Via Dolorosa&quot;).
It starts at the Fortress of Antony, the Praetorium, where the judgment was held, and continues through the streets of the Old City, going to the Holy Sepulcher on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of Anointing and to the place burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wailing Wall; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in AD 70.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will then come true.
Take a vertical trip
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 BC. C. for your family.
They are found on mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And get there by their own means, only those who are dedicated to climbing can.
Others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermón ski resort, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
Up there, from the foot of the hill there are bus services.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
In a single trip you will not be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it, the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and around 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces are preserved.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is worth a visit.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases by Impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bath-museum, which are some rooms of old Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers from that time.
In Caesarea it is worth stopping by the exclusive private Ralli museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops there.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children&#39;s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives ring out.
Ukraine is mentioned as well.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air heats up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and they bathe there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily sustains even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to undergo treatment courses with salty water, brine and healing mud and fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the mysteries of ancient times
They are preserved in the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route that linked Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through it.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets that are named after the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls in the street of your &quot;same&quot; symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newly married couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to get photographed.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, &quot;take&quot; the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don&#39;t worry if your English leaves a lot to be desired: in this country around 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to be carried in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekels (currently 1-3 $, 8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it is from an underground funicular.
Traveling on any type of public transport costs NIS 6 and for this price you can travel by transferring for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But on Sunday morning a new work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales, and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the faláfel, which are balls of ground chickpea, fruits and vegetables.
Stray dogs are not seen on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that &quot;walk as they please&quot; in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Purrs love crowded places and don&#39;t turn down treats.
Renting a car, depending on the make, will cost from $ 37 (Hyundai Getz) to $ 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to the insurance, which costs $ 15 a day.
And renting a bicycle will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of NIS 30.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that is 51% higher than the same rate in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011 .
&quot;The great and powerful&quot; will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While deputies and human rights defenders discuss the consequences that the law would bring on compulsory examination, scammers have already appeared in the country who deal in &quot;false&quot; certificates.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
They are mostly citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since December 1, a law comes into force, according to which each working immigrant must take an exam to verify their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule is applicable only to those who intend to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, household services, and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, the exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to take the language test, but also the Russian history test and the fundamentals of legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Exceptions are citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
People who managed to obtain their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defense of rights
The network of examination centers will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the Peoples&#39; Friendship University, the Moscow State University, the Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the tests in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 centers of this type are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, managed to ask the press this question many times: And what will this really contribute?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
In the first place, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, this will reduce the number of people who suffer &quot;labor slavery&quot;.
Many people are speaking today about defending the rights of labor immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of the cases.
The problems are faced by immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical check-up.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev affirms, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, put him on a &quot;little paid trip&quot; to a creepy and narrow cave, where he and dozens of others like he was consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive countless complaints from our immigrants.
&quot;In their homeland they are promised one thing, but upon arrival they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages,&quot; confirms the Head of the Labor Immigration Directorate of the Tajikistan Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don&#39;t be mad, boss!
However, in the meantime, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia acknowledge that not only do they not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families do not even have anything to feed the children, not to mention dressing them, putting them on shoes and buying them what they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if you do not know the language, they recognize them.
&quot;You feel humiliated and inferior.&quot;
However, when it comes to language law, advocates make an important point.
The exams will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no exam and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
&quot;Welcome or no strangers&quot;
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money - from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be done quickly and for only fifteen hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered, and extortion cases appear.
&quot;They are asking us for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea,&quot; Tajikistan citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
&quot;Come on, don&#39;t be stingy, buy a painting.&quot;
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that it is not only immigrant registration documents that can be false.
Several &quot;false&quot; certificates of knowledge of the language have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that &quot;diplomas&quot; cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers who would not have been able to successfully pass the exam the first time more time to study the basic course of the language.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Interior Ministry does not clamp down on the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the government&#39;s reaction to the recent incidents: Squeezing shots during wedding celebrations in which luckily there were no victims, and the massacre started by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinograddov, in which Squeezing seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons, from 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the law on possession of weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying &quot;heavy-handed policy&quot;.
An open letter has appeared online, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of &quot;senseless rigor&quot; be abandoned.
The percentage of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov told Russia&#39;s BBC news service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, compared to the total of 1,168 crimes registered for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that a stricter legislation in the sector of arms for civilian use will not be an inconvenience for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, in his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior affirms that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black market for weapons is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Víctor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and in the High General Staff.
Screenshot of the website accepting orders for weapons
The first, &quot;vestige of the army or military&quot;, that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
&quot;The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves,&quot; says Baranets.
The next type of &quot;black weapon&quot;, those stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
&quot;There are proven versions that some fires were set deliberately to cover the fault,&quot; says a former military man.
According to Baranets, arms manufacturers also do their bit.
&quot;Now private arms factories have proliferated that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under the hood to the black market, including that of Moscow,&quot; says the expert.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
Large numbers of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
&quot;There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons,&quot; explains the former military man.
Where do weapons come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of supply of illegal arms to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the weapons on the black market have gotten there &quot;because of officials whose work is related to weapons,&quot; the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to &quot;illegal archeology&quot;.
The clerk of one of the weapons stores, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers turn to military warehouses when they need a consignment.
Through an ensign, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT pistol.
They remove her from the registry and pass her over the fence.
&quot;This one takes the weapon to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers,&quot; he tells us.
&quot;But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime detection plan has to be fulfilled, they make test purchases from illegal arms dealers,&quot; adds the clerk.
&quot;Like in a luxury boutique&quot;
The seller and the buyer often meet through acquaintances.
&quot;I visited websites and blogs until a guy who suggested that I go to the&quot; Begovaya &quot;platform, where a man would be who would take me to a&quot; corner &quot;where we could negotiate.
I only found out about the price of the weapon there. &quot;
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
&quot;To get a gun I need a friend who has connections,&quot; says the store clerk. &quot;I have a friend like that, but I don&#39;t trust him very much.&quot;
There are vendors in the markets, but you also have to go there, let&#39;s say &quot;on behalf of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell him that his daughter&#39;s tooth had fallen out.&quot;
I can even get a pair of steel mitts from a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows that I will not betray him.
Newbies search for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranets put himself to the test as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was about to publish an article on this subject.
The schemes, in his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was &quot;not everything&quot;.
&quot;I felt like I was in a luxury boutique,&quot; recalls the military man.
To the buyer, in the words of Baranets, they do not offer a hoax: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, don&#39;t just buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
&quot;They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure that the weapon shoots well, we begin to negotiate,&quot; the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to &quot;Vkontakte&quot; sites and groups, where it is offered to buy weapons &quot;for different purposes&quot;.
No document or personal meetings are required for this.
&quot;It is enough to have a certain amount of money&quot;, they write in the title of the advertisement &quot;To buy a pistol or a machine gun&quot;.
There users place their orders and ask questions.
And do they sell to minors?
&quot;Without permission, of course,&quot; asks the user &quot;Ivan&quot; (spelling preserved).
&quot;I buy pistol TT. Moscow&quot;, laconically formulates his question &quot;Fedorenkov&quot;.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two-handed people who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to bait, and then, to mine coal in Siberia
military and ex-military commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems - usually the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People place orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
&quot;In response, they send him a photo and instructions so that he knows where the weapon is hidden,&quot; says the press secretary of the NGO &quot;The right to arms&quot;, Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if you order online, you are left without a gun and you are thrown in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two-handed people who want to buy firearms.
&quot;And people go, like hungry fish to bait, and then to mine coal in Siberia,&quot; he says.
Makarov for $ 100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO &quot;The Right to Arms&quot;, a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $ 100-300.
You will have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from the military warehouses by the mid-rank chiefs.
According to the official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of robbery and extortion weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the US go on strike
Up to a quarter of American teens find their first cashier jobs at &quot;McDonald&#39;s&quot;
In recent days, in the United States a wave of protests has started against the low wages paid in the supermarkets of the Walmart corporation and in restaurants of the popular fast food chains, such as &quot;McDonald&#39;s&quot;, &quot;Burger King &quot;,&quot; Taco Bell &quot;,&quot; Wendy&#39;s &quot;and&quot; Kentucky Fried Chicken &quot;.
For now, no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach nine points, or if it is destined to lose strength and tame itself in its early stages.
The protest actions have the support of the unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries received by Walmart workers and those in the fast food system, the objective of the organizers of the protests is the creation of labor unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called &quot;Black Friday.&quot; That day, in the United States began the orgy of sales that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by confrontations.
That day, some workers at the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed protest pickets with unions and left-wing activists in the stores of the corporation, whose products They are aimed at people of modest and moderate income.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles, and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs, and milk.
The products in its stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the largest supermarkets.
That&#39;s why many low-paid Walmart workers shop only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
In the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products very cheaply, in part because it pays its workers so little.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
That &quot;Black Friday&quot; the participants of the demonstration demanded increased salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who makes $ 9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the median wage to $ 12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $ 3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than what you spend on wages now.
If Walmart places the salary increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive.
In one year they will spend a ridiculous amount of $ 12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters comment with satisfaction that the protest took place in only nine states and did not cause any losses to the corporation.
&quot;Black Friday&quot; lasted in its stores from 8 pm Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers carried out on &quot;Black Friday&quot; almost 100 million transactions.
Company representative Dan Fogelman stated in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post website that &quot;fewer than five&quot; Walmart employees left his job and that the protest had been nothing more than &quot;another public relations stunt. &quot;, organized by the union of workers.
&quot;Free box!&quot;
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the targets were not exactly the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and for that reason there are none for now), but the &quot;McDonald&#39;s&quot; and other restaurants cheap.
McDonald&#39;s says they sell billions of servings, and then they don&#39;t even give you sick leave and they don&#39;t pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, under federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $ 7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing this over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York earn $ 8.90 per hour.
Nobody earns less than they do in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teens stopped by McDonald&#39;s and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there long.
Now, I constantly stumble into some interviews with McDonald&#39;s workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to feed them with.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at the McDonald&#39;s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks be paid at least $ 15 per hour, that is, to double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers&#39; unions be created in the fast food sector.
US law prohibits the administration from denying them this right and punishing union movement activists with tricks and firings.
On the other hand, management rarely makes their lives easier.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to embrace the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is excessive staff turnover.
Discordant
Loud protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at the McDonald&#39;s located near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democratic politicians, notably City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&#39;s says it is selling billions of servings, and then he doesn&#39;t even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work. &quot;
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate for mayor of the city Bill de Blasio, who said that &quot;we must support workers in the fast food sector to receive fair wages and economic prosperity. that every New Yorker deserves. &quot;
As the New York Times described it, this was the largest demonstration of its kind in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, not even all of them were employees of the fast food service, which employs tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this will spark a mass movement.
&quot;For now, tricking the brain is not so easy&quot;
The subject of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, is lately perceived normally mainly through the prism of special glasses.
In early summer, Google demonstrated a model in motion at its annual conference and later, in November, it emerged that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group in Microsoft&#39;s Cambridge laboratory, Izadi Sharamom, it was elucidated that for the scientists of that company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are drawn to the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in midair with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to human-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes you touch it with your finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without the Kinect, since everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
- Although the Kinect has brought interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional display systems, based on different technologies, including design.
The world of computing must be liberated from ours, the physical world, making it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the surrounding space.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those silly virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don&#39;t you think they are overestimating it?
- Of course, it cannot be considered a panacea, the privacy issue remains to be resolved, since we do not always want others to find out about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think in gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the device&#39;s camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- Usually I just talk.
- Oh, that is going to be very difficult to recognize.
- In other words, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Are you lacking resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
In other words, we have to remember not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Speed is also important, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche from our lab in Redmond made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects human-machine interaction.
An equivalent of such a device would be very useful for my work, but one that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And is it not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three &quot;cameras&quot;, one of which is in fact the emitter of infrared rays and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible tuning fork sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem ...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog, play around with the camera placement curvature, and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- From what I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don&#39;t you think that, from the point of view of daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding a smartphone in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a &quot;transmutable&quot; augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could pass from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that is their strength (only you can see private things), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let&#39;s imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark from the movie &quot;Iron Man&quot;, but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile feedback!
The hands feel nothing!
What responses does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
It registers the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibility to these &quot;images in the air&quot;. For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation similar to what one feels if someone were blowing into the fingertips, but that sensation is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think that he feels what he seems like he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That&#39;s a good idea, we haven&#39;t tried it yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that they are going to an open space, almost without end. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like those in gyms), mobile platforms, as well as giant balloons.
For now, tricking the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That is what makes working with virtual reality attractive for researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
&quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;Avant-garde of St. Petersburg&quot;, dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of the art and scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of &quot;Rosbalt&quot; is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion gatherings and openings.
Kirill Miller&#39;s paintings always draw crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophical storytellers from St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens smiles in the inhabitants and lifts everyone&#39;s mood.
Recently, he took an organ grinder in his hands and became the organ grinder of Saint Petersburg, since he has matured to play such a difficult role, due to his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why do you go around town dressed in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I am dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, image makers, and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray provokes aggressiveness and agitation of not good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you understand that you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that this was my path.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I befriended new wave artists, with the ones after the Gaza and Nevskiy artists, which led to &quot;Pushkinskaya-10&quot;, and the new wave is over.
I immersed myself in the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
- And all this came together in your Art Clinic ... - For me it was important to find myself in the cultural center of Saint Petersburg, where the best creative minds had to meet.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no renovations, there was a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemian in St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought &quot;Van Gogh&#39;s Ear&quot; to the project.
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began to play live, it became &quot;Leningrad&quot;.
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of their great career; basic education and training received from us.
Gallery &quot;D 137&quot;, the &quot;Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regular customers would go there.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the award was &quot;The people of our city.&quot;
In the nomination &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; I was chosen, thus ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes truth, honesty and the culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very uneducated.
- There is something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them the actuality and occurrence are clearly expressed.
I am going to do a scheduled exhibition, &quot;The Russian Museum on Clowns&quot;.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like that is painful and scary.
But in the clowns everything is smeared and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and obligatory change of clothes.
Now one is followed by clothing, orienting themselves externally, but not within the person.
And, perhaps that person should not even be shaken hands, but spit in their face.
And the deception will be removed when you change clothes.
- We recently saw you in the role of urban organ grinder. - A cultured city must have such a hero.
Who better than me to be!
- Good but, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before, people were grouped in herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simpletons others.
Now everyone has divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I&#39;m not a hundred dollar bill for everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov they arrive by the thousands!
- The abandoned ones are going to see it, the sex-social sphere works there.
And 300 people go to a cultural event, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When he was young he made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that&#39;s another story.
I am a man of yesterday&#39;s culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, they refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what is St. Petersburg missing?
- Good experts in culture.
There is a concept: civil servant of culture.
But not all of them can dedicate themselves to culture.
When the kings were the correct ones, everything was different, the kings perhaps did not understand the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the correct experts.
In Moscow now there are very good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they are closed, because experts at a higher level are needed to correctly evaluate them and pave the way for them.
Now subjective personal taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is Saint Petersburg to you?
- Saint Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land there.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural terrain and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is negligible.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Give birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board set out in search of a spare planet.
To conserve humanity, the main question is asked: How to continue the species in weightless conditions or on the same spare planet?
I think there is little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
&quot;These are Venus and Mars,&quot; says the chief investigator of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg PK (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus ... in space.
It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with flora.
It has been half a century since experiments with plants have been carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophila.
Quail eggs were sent into space in 1979 to see how the embryo develops under weightless conditions.
We get a normal chick as a result.
But then the problems begin.
&quot;The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stand on its own two feet and start moving,&quot; explains Vladimir Sychev, the laboratory director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Finding no support, the chicks did random cartwheels.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
&quot;And twice we managed to get the chicks to hatch, but then we stopped because it was impossible to work with them there,&quot; says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological &quot;miniarch&quot; flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.
However, only species of the same sex will travel on the &quot;Bion&quot; biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
&quot;This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out,&quot; says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, it has not yet been possible to tackle the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It is a difficult challenge.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot carry out their sexual instincts.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is capable of creating a suitable emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling into space for 50 years now.
The greatest risk was passed by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
&quot;After all, nobody has answered this question,&quot; says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just a year after flying into space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl&#39;s father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, there are only a few astronauts who, after long flights, everything has turned out well, and a healthy generation has been growing.
&quot;And if more can be said, it is dangerous even in orbital flights,&quot; sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydro-laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in the preparation for the flight.
In conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
The water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is its natal element.
The little amphibian-men seem to confirm that life on land arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside its mother in the amniotic fluid, since it will be easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
&quot;This is too little to forget something,&quot; says Marina Aksenova, newborn swimming instructor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation is necessary, the force of gravity.
In weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrease very quickly, the expulsion capacity of the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, relying on the action of stimulants for labor.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it will push you.
&quot;And then what?&quot; Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
It is impossible to dress a newborn in orbit in a special training suit, like adults.
It will simply deprive him of what is vital to him.
&quot;And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally maladjusted person,&quot; foresees the head of the Institute&#39;s bioethics committee. of biomedical problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical question.
However, in time this will become a reality, as the humans in their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their space-born children.
Head of NKÚ: The inspection of the &quot;švarc&quot; system has not found the guilty politician
When it comes to public awards, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although enforcement is lacking.
This is stated by Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
&quot;The law will never be perfect&quot;, but its application must be correct. &quot;This is, in my opinion, what we lack&quot;, this is how he describes the current situation.
The joint checks of the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas&#39;s attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the &quot;švarc&quot; system.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So is it forbidden or allowed?
&quot;The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, not even the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out said controls or demand obligations,&quot; Kala states.
At the meeting of the control commission in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the Czech and German teams, in the framework of which the legislation regarding public awards in both countries was compared.
What exactly?
This is a parallel control that we started to carry out about two years ago.
Said in a simplified way: European legislation regulates how public awards should be organized, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and, later, by the practice itself.
We have put it all together and, although the control has not finished yet, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is &quot;stricter and more complete&quot;, however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
Therefore, it is confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually contribute? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely a common control of this type could help us to stop investing efforts in the concretion of the laws, the reduction and the improvement of the limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
Saving economics means getting a suitable thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) in order to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But the fact of reducing the limit of the awards does not mean that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much &quot;paperwork&quot; that those who want to find fault with the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the practice of public awards.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKÚ or is it organized in a different way?
As for the offices, such as the NKÚ, the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts) operates there, with an organization similar to ours, with a college as well, the only thing is that in your case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
Also the powers are to some extent analogous, however, as long as Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control federal money, what we here call state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
Generally, I wouldn&#39;t want to make a comparison without hard data. However, Germany is still a model in some respects, but it is not possible to pinpoint exactly where it is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
Surely not, but, I repeat, I do not like to make such comparisons.
It goes without saying that even those countries that we take as a model face a great number of problems.
If not, it would be of no benefit to you to collaborate with our office, would you not?
Regarding the legislation of our country, what did the amendment to the law on public awards mean for your Office? Is its incidence manifested in some way?
Taking into account that the validity period of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex post controls, a certain delay is necessary.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new tool for &quot;detecting non-economic risks&quot;, through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process and the like are rectified.
Do you consider that the approval of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it represents a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope that it is.
The problem that can arise is that the regulations &quot;become tougher&quot; and that it is impossible to comply with them.
Already with the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operating programs of the regional council), and each law not respected in the matter of public awards meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to toughen the law in this way?
I think not this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal failure, which has no bearing on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this initiated path takes us.
The prime minister recently stated that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, referring to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc &quot;system forbidden or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits something, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out such controls and demand obligations.
You can say: &quot;We change the law and we allow it,&quot; but you cannot say that we will do nothing.
In the law on public awards, the regulations are quite strict as to the way in which one must act formally. And this is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice sheets, although most of them are passable
In several places in the Czech Republic, the roads have ice and snow patches.
Although most roads are passable, extreme caution must be exercised on some.
Karlovy Vary region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but had ice and snow patches.
The temperature drops and will oscillate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the lower areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Ore Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places, visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the regional highway operations control center.
The R6 expressway and the top-notch highway in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges where the surface can be icy and slippery.
Likewise, all second and third category roads are also passable, including mountain roads.
However, in some of them there are still sections with traces of ice and packed snow.
It is necessary to increase attention on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, reports the Directorate of Roads and Highways in its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets, especially in higher elevations in the Pardubice region.
Frosts can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on second and third category roads.
The I / 43 and I / 34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads in the mountains from Krkonoše to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of packed snow on the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemian area, the sky will be clear to partly cloudy today, with no precipitation.
Temperatures will generally range from minus three to one degree positive, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen region
The roads in the Pilsen region are passable today in the morning, although caution should be exercised and it will be necessary to adapt to the weather.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will progressively improve.
This is what emerges from the information from the region&#39;s highway operations control center.
The D5 motorway is passable with almost no restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most of the first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road on the border with Germany there may be sections with ice sheets.
The second and third category roads are wet, so in this case, there are also sections with ice sheets.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on the less traveled roads in the Šumava area.
Olomouc region
Drivers heading to the higher elevations of the Olomouc region will encounter partially slush snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the road in the direction of Videlský kříž.
Highway workers cleared the snow overnight; About three centimeters of snow accumulated on the Šumper road, according to the track administrators.
In the rest of the region, most roads are passable without restrictions.
&quot;In the highest areas of the Šumper road, there are traces of snow.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will find themselves with half broken snow in the direction of Jeseník &quot;, an operator of the Šumper road administration confirmed to the ČTK today.
His colleagues also came to the Jesenická on the ground and at night and, after the chemical treatment, the slopes in the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the tracks are passable without restrictions, on the Šternberská road drivers should drive carefully in the forest sections, where the tracks are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec region
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications on various sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures stay below zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road. On the other hand, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the central Czech massif, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
For the moment there have been no service complications.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the surroundings of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal overnight. During the day rain and melting snow are expected and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
From the general roads, unfavorable conditions have been announced on the I / 13 road, on the border between the Ústí nad Labem region and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had arched over the track under the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It is just one of many other alarmist news that we like to cling to.
The music group The Tap Tap rather likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it.
Also, in December you organize a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state charity event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, on December 20 at 9:00 p.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time that the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we forged the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, t-shirts, bags and original key rings against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way of supporting us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is entitled &quot;End of the world, canceled.&quot;
It is currently very popular on YouTube, will you be able to hear it at benefit concerts?
Of course I do, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world does not end ...
It will be sung by all the performers at the same time in all three concerts.
The hymns will be linked together simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics for this song and plays the title role of Jesus in the video clip, where Xindl X also sings ...
How did this collaboration come about?
We even work together with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts ...
We do our best to participate in this project.
Most of them have been shown to be interested and have fun working with us.
What will the money raised at the concerts against the end of the world go to?
To equipping the barrier-free education center Studeo, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
The pupils of the Jedličkův ústav school are regularly visited by teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
The students do not have sufficient financial means to pay the teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert several groups and interpreters act.
Which are the selection criteria?
We try to create a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform.
For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar &quot;spectacular action&quot; planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have performed for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It is not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in an electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments ...
However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to amaze me.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the trips abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you come across so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is still rare for a person to travel alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in the elevator, it is not there.
Fortunately, a civil association has been created that strives to thematize the problems of people with disabilities.
In what respects should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we are behind ...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to travel on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want ...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate in social life actively, in this regard, with The Tap Tap, we are a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, everything will really start to change.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered Jedličkův ústav as an educator, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, it got a bit out of hand (laughs).
However, the popularity did not arrive until these last years, or am I wrong?
It is true that connecting with famous singers and actively working to promote the group helped us a lot.
We conclude that work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the aid of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something can be done differently.
Show business is full of things that resemble each other.
It is logical, in its own way, everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction ...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and for whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it is not only progress for them, but for the whole of society.
Did the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you, help?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demand a certain discipline.
I think it is completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their heads in the clouds and when they find out that they have to attend two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and at concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently the group The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people come and go, it can&#39;t be helped.
Whoever has the will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 12.20.2012 at 9:00 p.m.
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda in Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava, with 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic participating.
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening through videoconference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap &quot;End of the world, canceled&quot;
The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance the multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free educational center in Jedličkův ústav in Prague, at a cost of 25 million CZK.
Admission to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free admission in the advance sale option at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At last week&#39;s meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on November 12, 2008).
Poland began an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years participated in the agency&#39;s project commission.
However, Poland&#39;s path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already involved in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. Šternfeld&#39;s lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study &quot;Introduction to Cosmonautics&quot;.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his &quot;Introduction to Cosmonautics&quot;.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, he was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a dresine was built in Poland that was to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is unknown and the details of the project are not known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for starting the dray or for braking it.
The information on this dresine is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From the year 1933 the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it is clear that the investigation reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was halted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study &quot;Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza&quot;, by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki, was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all projects of missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, the society was referred to for the first time with four very lengthy articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, by prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
From the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA had a significant role in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) probe rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, construction of the RM-1A version was completed, and in the summer of 1959, aerial testing of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the Błędów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was going to have an apogee of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, in 1962 the works were suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were differentiated from each other by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B it was 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C it was 0.62 liters.
The peak in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, the first aerial tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km high.
Later the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland&#39;s entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.
Suspending the social work law is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the social work law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to examine the existing problems from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labor cost (of wages) produces economic stress.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, by importing cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for this &quot;causes a drop&quot; in the price of the competitor in order to take over most of the market and, therefore, This way, you increase your profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labor, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital does not have any social responsibility and, therefore, is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social spending of the state necessarily grows.
All this situation fosters the total disinterest of businessmen to pay taxes and compensate for the economic and social damages that they have caused in their desire to obtain benefits.
The situation is universally so well known that it is not necessary to present concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially lowering the social level of their own population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country. country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population regardless of social decline.
This is evident above all in the changes in the laws in force.
The objective is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the financial obligation system in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, through the restricted right of employees regarding labor rights.
The result is increasing poverty along with widening the gap between rich and poor.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves with their own work.
The number of people who receive this type of aid already reaches one million.
Within the framework of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, a fairly frequent case occurs: people employed with a salary so low that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum essential to survive.
A scandal of this type related to the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The savings measures of practically all the southern states of the EU lead, without a doubt, to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social status, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live with a lousy salary on the edge of society, in the hope that one day private investment capital will arrive in the country.
Do you need to wonder where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never comes, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim ad nauseam that the state should not bring capital to the economy, that running the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends tooth and nail the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence the political march with its egoism and, therefore, the entire state.
In this case the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: state ministries, lacking financial means, entrust the drafting of bills to private law firms, which are often linked to industry.
These kinds of bills are later passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation such as that described by Appianos in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Times of Caesar and Pompeii: &quot;The state had been disintegrating for a long time and administrations were occupied by force &quot;.
In exchange for bribes, illegitimately obtained favors, and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread without any impediment and people went to the polls with the vote approved in advance &quot;...&quot; there were no people of character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of This disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls &quot;...&quot; It began to be spoken seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man &quot;... Although Appianos thought of Pompeii Caesar came to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that today&#39;s society is based on inconsiderate preferences for individual benefit without regard for common interests.
Private capital is not capable, in its essence, of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole of society.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, with no effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, waiting for the next coup.
The truly devastating fact is that today&#39;s elite are completely ignorant of the hundreds of thousands of losses in lives, the social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them in ancient and ancient history. the most recent.
Suspending the law on public awards is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social status of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is through concrete socio-political reforms that reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and that weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
&quot;That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could&quot;, Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads &quot;Let&#39;s do not forget how fragile we are&quot; what are we).
&quot;If my children did not want wars, there would be none&quot; Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, mixed reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on the side of Israel, argues in favor of the right of self-defense and pigeonholes the Palestinians into the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism by the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and labels Israel a terrorist state.
I don&#39;t want to focus on who is to blame for the periodically recurring killings and who is the victim. After all, today&#39;s citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the scenes, a look to discover who is profiting from the tensions that have dragged on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have reached based on my own understanding of the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity the history of power struggles is in the forefront.
In every age we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so evident is if these characters were always the ones who directed their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions towards a certain objective.
We must accept that we live in a time that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been reached in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I do not know, but I do not rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Naturally.
In the 90s of the 19th century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant empowerment.
They have significant stakes in almost all the world&#39;s central banks and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after Only four remained to topple Gaddafi, but in the meantime Russia has made the central bank subordinate to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschild&#39;s Bank of America central bank, started printing money during the Civil War and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK started printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their quest for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Freemason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially of Great Britain, and the third aimed to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would be enough and they would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families operates, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of the unleashing of crises and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the FED was created so that a crisis like the one in 1907 would not recur.
So, after the successful assassination of the Austro-Hungarian heir to the throne, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after the First World War broke out, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the start of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended in a sudden and unjustified way from the military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end Tsarist Russia were no longer necessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the empire Austro-Hungarian.
To prepare the ground for World War II, they allowed bankers and politicians to covertly create a conflict situation in the wake of the massive war reparations imposed on Germany, thereby creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, it was enough for them to serve the Germans with the Führer&#39;s solution, which was strong and simple enough and pointed out the culprits, and then to build a Czechoslovakia made up of several nationalities with a strong German minority that should and did represent the function of the fifth column, which lit the flame and caused the outbreak of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and the first conflicts began with the Arab population there.
Terrorist attacks were taking place on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much on the rope that international bankers had tied him to in the beginning or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If the international bankers were able to initiate it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim in the front line of combat, now together with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within its country, but also on an international scale. Take, for example, how Israel&#39;s supporters and critics are sharply divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where does injustice breed injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at the beginning of everything there was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all the world&#39;s oil passes (the shipping corridor has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are now portrayed the words David Rockefeller spoke in 1994: &quot;All we need is a general crisis and the people will agree to a new world order.&quot;
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
&quot;And it forces everyone, small and large, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in the forehead, add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six. &quot;
Argo Movie: If It Gets Raw, Call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of the Islamist student demonstration occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration the situation did not offer any positive prospect: throwing the shah overboard could not be allowed, since, if he did, he endangered the confidence of his allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was subsequently further intensified by the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The jailed diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government&#39;s negotiating intervention.
In the US, his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran was a decisive factor in Jimmy Carter&#39;s defeat to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film &quot;Argo&quot; by the director and actor Ben Affleck thematizes an episode of this story, which was a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for which an extravagant story helped an extravagant point: they left with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that was examining the location in the country for the filming of a science fiction blockbuster .
Combination of genres
The plan drawn up by &quot;exfiltration&quot; expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood&#39;s collaboration.
To make the lie appear true, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production company even had a real office.
The details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck&#39;s movie is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called &quot;caper movie&quot;, the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example could be the Ocean&#39;s Eleven series).
Moods are combined in the film. We find on the one hand well-documented sequences from Tehran. In the sequence of credits, emblematic photographs of the time of the events are shown, which were captured in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other, typical Hollywood scenes somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And also, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The teased actor has become a respectable director and his acting has ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is her third feature film, after &quot;Goodbye little one, Goodbye&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The Town. City of thieves&quot; (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck&#39;s first film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck proves it in Argo, where Tehran is &quot;filmed&quot; in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the real events. The introductory sequence of the seizure of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of bewilderment and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the impostor team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story doesn&#39;t offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And it manages quite well. Sometimes it adds something to reality: everything does not turn out so gracefully here (the scene of the crisis looming at the Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search on its trail all turn into madness ).
Argo&#39;s weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and they are by no means the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck&#39;s film loses a bit of dramatic edge, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, appreciating its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But for it to collapse, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof of how exaggerated secret services notions of omnipresence and omniscience can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually presents a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the contest on &quot;the most absurd rules or ideas of the EU workshop&quot;.
&quot;It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent quota of women in management positions in large European companies,&quot; explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities named is, for example, the recent decision of the European court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women took advantage of better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
&quot;Other amazing ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by people until the end of this year.&quot;
The election will take place at the end of February 2013, &quot;Nacher reported.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, damages the environment; Another ban is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers just because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline on chicken cage size, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year. .
The factual ban on the use of the expression &quot;spreadable butter&quot; or the withdrawal of the classic light bulb from shops has been criticized.
A quality banana should be 14 centimeters long.
The Union apparatus makes this type of decision often under pressure from one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, vindicates the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the highest quality bananas in the EU should be at least 14 centimeters long and could not have &quot;abnormal curvatures&quot;.
The European Commission defended itself by saying that this only seeks to harmonize national standards that have not been homogenized to date, which only complicated their commercialization.
The rules that refer to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been relaxed on the grounds that the existing directive leads to food waste.
The candidate to win the poll could be last year&#39;s EU prescription according to which inflatable balloons that are marketed are required to warn that children under 8 years of age are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU referred here to an American study according to which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of child death by suffocation.
A similar restriction is also in force on the use of noisemakers by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European civil servants: anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, one should speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state .
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day we entered the EU.
Later, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume established for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of a substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of awarding a grant for the application for grants.
These kinds of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
&quot;We are at a disadvantage due to the fact that we have no sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation &quot;, declared in autumn 2004 the then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued this with the fact that in our country a lot of cereal was produced and, as a consequence of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and it had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities by the ministry for local development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of Brussels grant applications.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
Member state guidelines are often the target of criticism, the EU&#39;s regulatory efforts and also more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve, according to various experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which member states have achieved in budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also struck a chord, in the same way as other EU countries, by the fight for the right to a designation of origin for their traditional products, although our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the appellation of origin of the Olomouc cottage cheese, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and was renamed &quot;tuzemák&quot;.
Only products made from sugarcane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known throughout the world, marzipan from the German city Lübeck or ham from Parma, there are already Karlovy Vary biscuits, the Pohořelice and Třeboň carp and even the Žatec variety of hops.
As protected gangs of the EU, they can be proud of the gingerbread from Pardubice and the waffles from Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want me to save the republic, but I&#39;m a fan, says Okamura
Senator, how did you come up with running for president?
It is not about being a senator or president.
If everything went well in our country, then I would not present my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how stealing is done in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, taxes and the retirement age are increased.
He had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something that I don&#39;t like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I am forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only possibility I have to change things is to run as a senator or president.
He has already reached the Senate, but soon after he has set out for the presidency.
Are you not turning your back on those who have voted for you?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later I specified that if I was elected senator, I would present my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; function is the tool with which I can bring my own ideas to life.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to initiate a change.
Added to this are the media, which discredit you and confuse freedom of expression with freedom to lie.
It is said that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let&#39;s talk about your ideas.
He is presented to the presidential fight with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property over twenty million.
To do this, the law must change.
As president he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group for the profession of guide to be recognized as autonomous work, and we succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, be it from the right or the left, it is purposely rejected and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to win the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without typecasting or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a man of the right or of the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more on the left.
It doesn&#39;t matter to me, whether it&#39;s a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we move forward.
I don&#39;t care if someone is on the right or on the left, I want to bring people together.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will likewise be against bad ideas.
You are joking when it is said of you that you are a populist.
But isn&#39;t he showing it by what he says?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get closer to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals that I speak of already work in the world or well-known experts speak of them.
But without the support of parliament, only slogans remain.
And with it he cannot survive in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial responsibility?
I do not have any other option.
Convincing politicians, journalists and civil society and trying to do my part to achieve it.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live broadcast on television in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they don&#39;t want to.
If there is a strong character who points out the disputes, pressure can be put into the political scene.
Take for example the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I have just started in politics and am trying to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to get things done myself, but in case it doesn&#39;t go well, in six years I will quit and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I am no savior.
I know that I do nothing with a person, that is why I have visited a series of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to present their candidacy for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed fraud with light heating oils.
I presented myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I am in the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls, and those who did, voted for establishment representatives.
In the Senate there are two of us from the independent sector.
The people elected the Senate, in such a way that it will be difficult to achieve change.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Considering forming your own party?
I have not considered it yet because I do not have time for it, to check the flawless past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have money.
I don&#39;t even have money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Does not have money?
Talk about property declarations, how is yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a piece of land valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another apartment valued at eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin worth about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued in a million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream when I was young. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant towards women and, at the same time, fought against evils and injustices.
You drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you have no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don&#39;t want to put too much money on your part.
It is not very convincing.
I don&#39;t have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to get into debt?
In the campaign I have already put 2.5 million.
The fact that I do not have a sponsor shows that there is not much interest in my program.
And I do not have the obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
Campaign expenses essentially cover what I will receive as a senator&#39;s salary.
But I couldn&#39;t live on it. For example, I couldn&#39;t pay my son for English school, which costs SEK 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, then I would not run.
So will you continue with your business to live?
Have you not said before that you were going to leave this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I have promised, I have partly stopped my activities.
For example, my travel agency representative will become my replacement in the spring.
People would like the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to make a living from something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep winning.
If he were president, then he would go out of business.

The MVRDV architecture studio proves that true adventures are not only in the head - on the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently completed &quot;mountain of books&quot; - 2 photos
&quot;I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic look, and there is finally something interesting to see,&quot; says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing by on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, notes: &quot;Besides, the building is nice.&quot;
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have the Internet, tablets, and e-books.
Nobody enters those old-fashioned libraries for pleasure, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town on the doorstep of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honor of having set a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counteract this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and to copy the seven fictional bridges that are represented on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that&#39;s how the policy makers decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for buildings that are fun as well as cynical, took up the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the contest in the year 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked around in puzzlement and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size into a pyramid and concluded his short speech with the following words: &quot;Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for Spijkenisse&#39;s mountain of books, the so-called &#39;Boekenberg&#39; &quot;.
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain rises in its intended location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and semi-detached buildings.
At the beginning of November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize &quot;Best Library of NL 2012&quot;.
Furthermore, the project is also nominated for the &quot;Dutch National Wood Award 2012&quot;.
In this way, the small city devoid of history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather intuit a dairy farm, now has a work of architecture contemporary.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a cheese factory.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at each step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to see, the annealed brick floor and elegant street lamps unequivocally support the public status of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up, you can see the park benches, the dogs and the boys and girls playing soccer.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
&quot;Usually the bookcases are arranged along the façade and in the center opens a huge dark room that, in general, is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal,&quot; says Winy Maas.
What we have done is turn the classic spatial configuration upside down and take the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention should be made of the black shelves that take on the functions of wall cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.
Sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unfamiliar material.
&quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the town of Spijkenisse.
And that&#39;s how one day, on a Frisian farm, we came across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands have used a plastic fabric a few millimeters thick as a base to hold the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine tissue lasts for two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library, this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, until obtaining plates four centimeters thick.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mixture of a new car and a sneaker.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain, the reward awaits us: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and their planted ficus in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment while maintaining adequate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
&quot;Although it is hard to believe given its large glass surfaces, this building is an exemplary project when it comes to ecology,&quot; says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Despite the fact that the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden trusses running across the glass façade provide shade and absorb most of the sun&#39;s rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is up to the automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
Likewise, the professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the &quot;Boekenberg&quot; as the &quot;late soul&quot; of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has penetrated deep.
The shelves are packed.
&quot;There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says architect Winy Maas.
&quot;I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain bond with this building.
Everyone knows that their book is part of the library.
Even if it&#39;s only there to garnish.
In this way, the MVRDV studio has achieved great success in that queen discipline that in specialized jargon is known as &quot;creating an identity&quot;.
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uneducated he may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: &quot;The Germans must play a more leading role&quot;
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather tricky diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier in the week, Germany hinted that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories UN observer state status.
However, finally Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, due to the special relationship that binds the country to Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I don&#39;t think he supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising that took place in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position when important international issues are at stake?
Yes that&#39;s how it is.
This is because at the moment it is reorienting its foreign policy, away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and towards a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they are still working out what their role will be, but they have already started on the path to a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to that of countries like France or Great Britain.
What does a &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy mean concretely from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for this reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken on the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, she must be careful not to alienate herself from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it that much importance since it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position is highly understood.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic break as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps in this way Germany has managed to earn a certain respect.
At the end of the day, all this has only shown that it is a country that is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the US has been clearly in favor of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of American domestic politics.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend that position.
I think that the true disparity of opinion is not really the size that is attributed to it.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a bit easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but this is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but must promote things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a tricky subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of a major international actor? Does Germany really want to take a leading role?
Or is it still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not gotten used to it yet, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a bigger role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the main player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seen in this light, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
You must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the USA in European politics diminishes more and more, but the EU does not fill that void at the moment, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to assume a more leading role.
Even if they don&#39;t like it, find it unpleasant, or make them an even more unpopular people, c&#39;est la vie!

&quot;Brand Protection&quot; in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese Brands
Armani is a globally known brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name there is a name that is officially registered in China but has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it is protected as long as the true eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it is not clear that they are going to agree.
&quot;Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the Taylor Wessing law firm specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters in order to register their trademarks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies also legally copy themselves in the same way, as has happened to the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet containing seats from the Beijing trademark office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma trademark, an artificial name also used by the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are department stores with several floors dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, the Pattloch cases are of a different nature. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to profit from a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it &quot;Bang Ming Pai&quot; or companion brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term &quot;Bang Dakuan&quot;,
which refers to women who have &quot;caught&quot; a rich man.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
&quot;It&#39;s bad for business, you have to fight it,&quot; Pattloch demands.
&quot;The brand is leaking, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous.&quot;
The financial losses and the legal costs of the affected sectors are in the millions, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15,000 million euros per year, China is, in size, the third market for luxury goods and the one that grows the fastest.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the trademark registry is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
The processes can take up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because so much time had elapsed that the name that was the subject of the lawsuit had already become a &quot;market reality.&quot;
&quot;If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist money because the process has damaged the plagiarist&#39;s brand in China,&quot; says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that was recently taken over by German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo&#39;s buyer, Geely, originally used a white and blue logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
Clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to copycats from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo depicted a crocodile looking in the opposite direction from the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they had difficulties due to a shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, &quot;the labor emergency situation returned to normal.&quot;
In this way, the number of unprocessed claim processes has been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As is customary in China, the numbers are staggering.
Last year the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the trademark office.
It seems that this also occurs with the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been pocketed in royalties.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese copycat.
While the Germans have succeeded in stopping the illegal manufacture of knockoff auto parts,
the copycat has managed to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
&quot;We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected,&quot; says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the appeal of the people from Munich.
In the next two instances they have agreed with Freudenberg, but the other side is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful
Now the case has reached the doors of the Superior Court of Justice, where it is still pending resolution.
Wentzler is confident that he will be able to resolve the issue favorably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that &quot;the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.&quot;
Internal costs are difficult to estimate; the corporate file has had to review files up to one hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a &quot;six-figure sum in euros&quot; with the aim of reaching an amicable settlement, but to no avail.
&quot;This shows how much we care,&quot; says Wentzler.
The dangers lurking in the Far East even threaten to affect Europe,
specifically if imitators secure their rights to unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the Freudenberg name for shoes and leather products in Germany.
The group has long since abandoned this commercial sphere, however it managed to prevent registration.
&quot;You have to be extremely careful,&quot; says Wentzler.
Both he and attorney Pattloch advise German companies to be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to trust international legislation on trademark rights, but what you have to do is &quot;also register in China everything that may be susceptible to protection&quot;, as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the theme can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, should Freudenberg lose the last round of his private battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license fees in his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dance, Sing, Help
Imbongi choir rehearses in Heidelberg and AIDS orphans rejoice in Swaziland
The story of a bond capable of overcoming much more than 8,733 kilometers in distance.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heels and loafers look for the beat on the parquet floor, and they find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly rise (alto, bass, tenor, and soprano), swirling, dulling, and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to almost go out of his mind as he tries to bring order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
The fifty singers have also arrived, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the householder.
&quot;Om&#39;Obani&quot; is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations program to fight AIDS, worldwide there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found godparents in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans in the town of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means &quot;storyteller&quot; or &quot;panegyricist&quot; in Zulu.
No one in this room can speak this Bantu language fluently, but they can sing.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
8,733 kilometers away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a town called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest AIDS infection rate and the lowest life expectancies in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not approve of circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swazi people are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in their early thirties has become common.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this remote town, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the chances in a poor country are more than slim.
At first it was only the private commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; which has since professionally cared for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STDs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Crabs and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more often in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis recorded in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea infections.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are in this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among young people than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are notifiable.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were registered.
This is one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore go undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer one hundred percent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you frequently change your sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for their performances throughout Germany, they come to raise quite a bit of money.
&quot;In total we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,&quot; says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In Zodwa Dlamini village itself, a confident woman with leadership gifts manages the money sent from Germany.
She makes sure that the orphans find good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The &quot;gogos&quot;, as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the town.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof to live in and see that the children attend school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are left under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who are in charge of cooking every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, &quot;Voices of Africa&quot; has started a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has succeeded in getting many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not something obvious, since, despite how evident this disease is throughout the country, it is not usually talked about openly.
A king with 14 wives
&quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it has to do with sexuality.&quot;
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and opulent lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This not officially accepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the innumerable seasonal workers who travel the country from one place to another and who take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, &quot;you can get free condoms on any street corner, but they are hardly used.
It&#39;s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact. &quot;
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two to three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still They remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; So much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to draw a couple of tears from the occasional rabid border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit sponsored children.
Although this small town hardly appears on maps, it is well known in the Ezulweni River Valley.
&quot;Come to Esitjeni, the light shines there,&quot; say the locals.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms on Bergheimer Street packed with singers marking the pace, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the North American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there is also icy water there, as shown by three studies published on Thursday in the specialized journal &quot;Science&quot;.
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that an ice sheet has formed in the permanently shadowed area of the planet.
It looks like it is at least 30 centimeters and probably even 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, with high probability, from asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one connects the ice finding with the possibility of life on the planet, says the Messenger probe&#39;s chief investigator, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help shed light on how water and other components of life have reached other parts of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed by the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: little windows into the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, Ceres is not a &quot;planet.&quot;
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a &quot;family portrait&quot; in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the stars. &quot;newborn&quot; stars.
This star-forming region, unromantic named by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This iridescent image of a dying star was taken by NASA&#39;s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made up of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA&#39;s Spitzer Telescope took this photo of the galactic star-forming zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known by the nickname &quot;The Seven Sisters&quot;, are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can see the colors better.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image produces spectacular colors.
This budding star could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns in astronomy.
It is probably the remains of one of Saturn&#39;s moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs ever taken by the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the hues, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term &quot;trifidus&quot; (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the burning heart of this star formation zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light years from Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of merging are pouncing towards each other to end up colliding irremediably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the nickname of Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula located 1,400 light years away is made up of dust particles whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiographs made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, served for a moment as a model for NASA&#39;s Hubble space telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
The brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way is found in this nebula.
This zone of star formation constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars also continually emerge; 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when mostly hydrogen could be found in the universe.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have more and more depth.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
It allows observing the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The disadvantage of this cheaper construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico), researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone with a computer can help with the &quot;Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence&quot; (SETI) by providing processing power.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Large European Telescope).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and will be made up of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take images.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
On Mauna Kea, a new telescope of enormous proportions and a mirror diameter of thirty meters is planned.
This is an image of what it would look like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes to us from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the beginning of its mission.
The image shows the final preparations leading up to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers assume that there is also ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
Radar measurements have been pointing to ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is the case.

The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus clatters along the winding road past forested hills, high-flowing rivers, and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that it is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
The &quot;talyshi&quot; live here, a people about whom not much is known, apart from the fact that they are fluent in Persian and Azeri and are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and does not seem to fit entirely into such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists barely make it to this place, as the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The staggering wealth the country enjoys from oil from the Caspian Sea has yet to reach this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
&quot;Baku became famous in May for the celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world,&quot; says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
The lives of eight dozen local talyshis who are over 100 years old are documented here. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son of his died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the sheep herder Şirali Müslümov, who appears to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no certified birth certificate.
And if we consider that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov&#39;s age is quite suspicious.
&quot;He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,&quot; Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently she still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
So is Şirali Müslümov wrong about his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
&quot;In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan there are also very elderly people,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;even in Sardinia there are many older men.&quot;
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; especially when there is no civil registry.
Every day glasses filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik tend to reach a Biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the South?
Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in the food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the high-calorie diet of the talyshi, who adore meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of daily melted butter, be so healthy.
Or maybe it&#39;s the natural way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, he is relatively young for what is popular in these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she tirelessly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva&#39;s sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents long ago.
Two young children are also jumping from side to side.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that is served in a typical cup shaped cup.
Mirzayeva&#39;s teeth are white and perfectly aligned, and under the scarf she hides two long braids of dark blond hair that her son proudly reveals to us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen out and has kept its color.
&quot;I&#39;ve never used a shampoo either,&quot; says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In all my life, I have never been shopping in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-WWII era.
However, everything returned to normal when the &quot;dear father&quot;, Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult of the nation&#39;s father figure, who runs his country like a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, at which point he handed over the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the older people of Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (roughly the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount that she can live on well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva&#39;s gray-haired son is right: &quot;in our culture the elderly are highly respected.&quot;
They live in a big family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn&#39;t reason enough to stay alive for many years ...
The Constitution lacks the expression &quot;Human Rights&quot;
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivaling demonstrations in Cairo reveal the tremendous division in which the country is plunged.
The future constitution, with the sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not skimp on pathos.
&quot;We must overcome the transition.
And that this happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God, &quot;he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Christian Copts, the Liberals, the Enlightened Muslims and the secularists.
All of them, until now hopelessly mired in confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his &quot;in order to save the revolution.&quot;
However, neither the Egyptians nor the entire world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. degree from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Are you trying to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly made up of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour evening meeting, are truly concerning.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that jurisprudence is based on &quot;principles of Islamic law.&quot;
However, what does &quot;principles&quot; mean?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal room for maneuver that comes with it, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new added article suggests: on all matters relating to sharia, it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It doesn&#39;t have to be this way, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that would - in fact - result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts served to exert harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state must protect &quot;the true essence of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;promote its morals and values.&quot;
It is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Speaking clearly, it is not about anything other than censorship.
Certainly, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, another prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it should be sanctioned.
Equally dubious is the formulation that prohibits &quot;offending persons&quot;
Is a cartoon of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
A matter of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that according to his words, &quot;very soon&quot; will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
&quot;The revolution has returned&quot;
For weeks the opposition has been closing ranks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir del Cario Square and vowed to defeat the Act before it could enter into force.
&quot;The revolution has returned and we will end up winning&quot;, affirms Hamdin Sabbahi, who occupies the third place in the lists to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft constitution should be &quot;in the dustbin of history.&quot;
Through Twitter, he accused Mursi&#39;s followers of wanting to lead a &quot;coup against democracy.&quot;
&quot;When he calls the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow him,&quot; says opponent Jasser Said.
&quot;We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiated,&quot; opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in the Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not want to supervise the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
&quot;The Koran is our constitution&quot;
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration; just in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, in front of the University of Cairo.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists took part in it shouting: &quot;The people demand the application of divine law.&quot;
They demanded that Mursi &quot;clean the country&quot;, while proclaiming: &quot;the Koran is our constitution.&quot;
A fight for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi supporters did not want to risk something like this happening.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now the time would have come to let the people decide at the polls which direction the country should take.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists is guaranteed the majority.
&quot;The expression &#39;Human Rights&#39; does not even appear&quot;
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that in reality should have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or faced trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him Human Rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
&quot;And now the expression &#39;Human Rights&#39; does not even appear in the new constitution,&quot; he laments in a conversation with the newspaper &quot;Welt am Sonntag.&quot;
The extension of the powers of Mursi to the three powers of the State made this lawyer resign himself.
The measures adopted are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
&quot;Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,&quot; laments Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could work against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: &quot;You are conceiving a monster that you will not be able to control.&quot;
Norwegian rakfisk: the world&#39;s stinkiest fish?
Norway&#39;s five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not just in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country&#39;s success has something to do with its craving for extremely smelly fish?
Take a number of overly aged cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet soccer clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway&#39;s delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It is snowed. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is left to ferment in water for, depending on how smelly you prefer it, up to a year.
As it grows dark and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this most, so to speak, captivating delicacy.
&quot;You eat it raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit in one gulp,&quot; says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the &quot;General of Rakfisk&quot;, who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small buckets and drinking large quantities of the drink in one gulp.
&quot;Some people like aquavit better than rakfisk,&quot; says Havard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I try some chunks.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it is not bad; It&#39;s not much different than a slice of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, when poverty plagued Norway and when, before refrigeration existed, fish were kept during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken out and, evidently with the senses inactive due to the alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is increasing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and until recently much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
Rakfisk is seen as something important, an essential, if rather smelly, part of Norway&#39;s past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you a whopping € 10 ($ 14) each.
Norway is rarely on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it that way.
People here are still reluctant to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as &quot;the July 22 event.&quot;
Norwegians have a very hard time believing that in their peaceful country one of their own was capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway&#39;s wealth today is the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world&#39;s largest oil and gas industries.
&quot;But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well,&quot; says Anna, our waitress, as she passes trays of rakfisk, who, with her long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being. .
&quot;We are, as you say, prudent people.&quot;
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
&quot;We don&#39;t like bragging, we don&#39;t like ostentation.&quot;
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously; Everything except a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn&#39;t have during the years leading up to the global financial crisis, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
&quot;As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy,&quot; says Anna.
&quot;And eat rakfisk,&quot; he adds with a hearty laugh.
I&#39;m in the snow queuing for something to eat; I&#39;ve had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is undoubtedly something different and quite succulent to savor.
But at night, that smelly fish comes back.
The hotel I stay at is one of the many venues that host a rakfisk dinner in which diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that most tests the nostrils.
A television has connected live with a presenter wearing a bow tie and surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
It looks like the Eurovision contest.
&quot;What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?&quot;
&quot;Here&#39;s our score, Havard.&quot;
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls out of his chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it&#39;s the fumes from all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
As Mexico&#39;s incoming President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant analyzes the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad these days.
In a city that, under the best of circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts off several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and will assume the management of the nation.
You are faced with a difficult task.
Mexico has been obtaining good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
&quot;My administration has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,&quot; explained Mr. Peña Nieto earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Office.
&quot;I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.&quot;
Before rubbing shoulders with the US president, Mr. Peña&#39;s previous political experience was as governor of his home state of Mexico.
A highly populated and rapidly growing state that surrounds the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided on this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents credit it with the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructures.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto&#39;s new highways, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and potholed roads that were rehabilitated.
Plaques with his name can also be seen at the entrance of a modern sports hall and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
&quot;We are confident that he will achieve real and lasting change,&quot; says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a deputy for Mr. Peña Nieto&#39;s party, the PRI.
&quot;Particularly when it comes to security and the economy, we look forward to the interesting and true change that our country so badly needs.&quot;
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also rejects the opposition&#39;s description of the lack of essence of the new president.
&quot;He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a fantastic statesman and, above all, he is a person who knows how to listen. &quot;
However, across the state that&#39;s not the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated stretches of freeway it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also tough and urban.
At the beginning of this year the intervention of the military was requested to help in the fight against drug gangs that operate in the neighborhoods and violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately notorious for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
The most critical accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make an effort to hold back tears as she shows me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
&quot;When I got to her house, it seemed as if her body had been cleaned,&quot; recalls Mrs. Buendía.
&quot;There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared.&quot;
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross in which a single word is read: Justice.
Yet that is exactly what the family says has been denied.
&quot;The state authorities have treated me like an old gossip, a troublemaker, a complainer.
What they want is for you to just accept what they say and shut up. &quot;
&quot;But that cannot be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,&quot; he says.
The presidential sash that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by an enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has promised to give them priority during his tenure.
&quot;I hope he is the same type of president that he was when he was governor,&quot; says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
Yet that is exactly what the families of the Ciudad Neza victims fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report mistreatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with allegations of abuse by Bradley Manning while in prison
The trial focuses on Manning&#39;s period at the Quantico Military Prison in Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning&#39;s incarceration was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in US history, missed multiple opportunities to report the mistreatment he now alleges he suffered while in military detention.
During the prosecution&#39;s cross-examination of Manning at a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, District Attorney Commander Ashden Fein stated that records of the weekly visits by unit officers Manning received during nine months of detention at Quantico , Virginia, do not show any complaint about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing held in response to the defense&#39;s request that the case be dismissed given that his incarceration had been harsh and that it had already entailed sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought about committing suicide while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
At Friday&#39;s hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico Military Prison, where he was held on maximum confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers reportedly asked Manning questions and recorded his responses.
When Fein inquired about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had rated the caretakers&#39; treatment as &quot;excellent&quot; and the treatment received at the facility generally as &quot;very professional.&quot;
The forms do not show any allegations of mistreatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had expressed concern about some issues and that visiting officers had raised those issues and indicated that they would be addressed, but that they did not record those issues on the record.
&quot;They were writing &#39;without incident&#39; (after having discussed the issues) but this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that I hadn&#39;t mentioned any issues,&quot; Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not denounced the treatment she was receiving during the January 2011 meeting with a council tasked with examining suicide intentions that she had expressed on a form months earlier. .
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the &quot;injury prevention&quot; regimen he was under.
The military said they had placed him under the restrictive regime, which is one degree below vigilance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
&quot;I wanted the staff to know that I was okay and (wanted) to stop being under injury prevention ... so that I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life,&quot; Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered committing suicide in Kuwait and that he once lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
&quot;My world was reduced to just Camp Arafjon, that cage,&quot; Manning explained Thursday.
&quot;I thought I was going to die in that cage.&quot;
Manning claimed that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least 21 hours and often 23 hours, without company.
Manning said that he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, some flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from outside pointed at his eyes while he slept.
He said that if the guards couldn&#39;t see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning&#39;s attorney filed a formal complaint about Manning&#39;s treatment in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in Thursday&#39;s statement, according to which, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of him. of the guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During questioning by the judge on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order given by the guard that he should drop the blanket that could have been covered, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before in an attempt to prove to an officer that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning claimed that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic in his underwear or flip-flops to injure himself but that he had not.
Manning testified that her underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from her cell that night.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he went through during his time in prison and drastically reduce his sentence should he be convicted at the court martial, which is scheduled to begin early in the year. the next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to misdemeanors and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of the detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules that apply to all detainees in maximum custody at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperating with the enemy, illegally causing information to be posted on the Internet, leaking national defense information, and theft of property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face life in prison.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He states that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had barely walked down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Some signs pointed the way to two queues: one for &quot;Mexicans&quot; and one for &quot;Foreigners.&quot;
I stood there for a few seconds not sure where to go.
Growing up in Central California, I have been called &quot;Mexican&quot; all my life.
It is ethnic shorthand, in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as &quot;Irish&quot; or my friends in New York refer to themselves as &quot;Italian.&quot;
Later I decided on &quot;Mexican-American&quot;.
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather&#39;s country, shorthand or hyphens were not necessary.
He was simply American.
Speak Spanish. Well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don&#39;t have the vocabulary level of a native and I can&#39;t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and got in the queue for foreigners.
I thought of that moment this week when Mexican President-elect Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The day&#39;s agenda, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, included: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why a Mexican is as likely to stay in Mexico at this time as it is to venture to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trade bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of rancor.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So the moment a United States official says anything that carries the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how the Americans are usurping sovereignty. from your neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma are on the warpath.
And yet, for Mexico, the truly challenging relationship is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.
Are we talking about rancor?
There&#39;s a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or the mother. or one of the grandparents, to whom the door of opportunity in Mexico was closed and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of education, coming from a poor town, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and having good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican dream.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It is for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as if we are from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have left.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in America but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally when she was a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more strongly who they are and the latter are bothered by it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexican.
Now, to complicate things even more, from what I have learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as makeshift &quot;ambassadors&quot; for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how great it is to visit that country and pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes of course...
That&#39;s not gonna happen.
There is too much resentment.
And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re going to be left alone with this idea, folks.
It&#39;s fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans still resent how their family members were treated. much less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are more &quot;Mexican&quot; than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the usual useless arguments about who started first, scores of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has shattered everything, whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this will make their fight even bloodier than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that its deadly stalemate could unravel.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism currently seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed to on November 21 is maintained, the clashes this week have strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has taken a good beating.
And despite having killed some of its leaders and forced Gaza&#39;s 1.7 million inhabitants into one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its ruthless rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders may conclude that time is working in their favor.
As Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been Israel&#39;s closest Muslim ally, has embraced Hamas&#39;s cause. So has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Exultant Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia party dominates, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist lean could topple Bashar Assad, to the reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood are first cousins of Hamas and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as a protagonist who cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel&#39;s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
When it comes to the military issue, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel&#39;s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its worth and many of Hamas&#39;s missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis will sleep easier ... for some time.
When it comes to diplomacy, the United States is firmer than ever; Many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, thanks in part to the barrier corroding the West Bank, the main chunk of a would-be Palestinian state territory, and it protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite being illegal under international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, is in a good position.
Why pamper those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn&#39;t they fire rockets as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
Better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they lift their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing will prevail, although the Arab Spring could alter its calculations.
Although the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere may not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel&#39;s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the superpower in the area will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire bodes well and could usher in something.
Israelis, too, should think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is creating a tinderbox that will one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, in the same way that a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are worsening the situation as the Arab population increases.
Bloody missions to Gaza every two to three years to repel Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one that sensible people on both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper proclaim: two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to curb the entry of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented position to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs oblivious to the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain virtual state status at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own plan for peace.
Back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to give it his attention.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Plain Tobacco Packaging Act goes into effect in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases appear on packs of a dull green color, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australia&#39;s world-pioneering Plain Packaging and Tobacco Act comes into force, replacing brand logos and colors with dull olive green packaging, gruesome images of diseased body parts and depictions of sick children and babies from being the children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the packs, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small typeface.
It is the strictest regime in the world for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government states that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by removing the traits that make the habit glamorous.
Trust studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before age 26, there is a 99% chance that they never will.
&quot;You can see that children, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,&quot; said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how the girls associated the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Despite the fact that Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and that these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
The tobacco companies claimed that the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
&quot;The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,&quot; said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring in to sell on the streets of Australia.
Other people say their business has benefited from the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers to cover up the ugly images on packs had skyrocketed from almost zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain&#39;s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha claimed that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and was waiting for more stocks.
&quot;For us it is a good deal.&quot;
According to experts, the potential hurdle is the popularity of social media among the demographic targeted by the plan.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to display cigarettes, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has prohibited advertising on the Internet to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign sites.
&quot;If you market tobacco and have only this small window left to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be,&quot; said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman saw an increase in reviews of brands from &quot;ordinary citizens&quot; posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
You wonder if this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has gone to the trouble of making a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
Australia&#39;s British American Tobacco indicated that the industry is more focused on what the new regulations entail than on marketing.
The industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules; These countries are asserting to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a ruling in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had been in talks with other countries that are considering similar laws on tobacco packaging.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to make it compulsory to include images on packs.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
In Australia many smokers are defiant.
&quot;The photographs do not affect me.
I just ignore them. &quot;
&quot;You take the cigarette and put the package away,&quot; says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
&quot;There is honestly only one reason I would quit smoking: for my daughter.&quot;
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack tobacconist in central Sydney, says uniform packs make it more difficult for him to place them on the shelves.
&quot;It normally took an hour to unsheathe a delivery; now it takes four,&quot; Yu says.
&quot;The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, that&#39;s it, okay, it&#39;s over and we closed the store,&quot; he says while raising his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it&#39;s not so bad to get a little bored
During the Thanksgiving holidays this year, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I&#39;m not going to lie to you.
Spending half a day in an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention duty-free shops.
But more and more scholars and child development experts are praising the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it is okay that both we and our children get bored from time to time.
Being bored forces the brain to search for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we take boredom in good spirits?
Yes.
And no.
But, we will talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as stated by Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of the book &quot;Boredom: A Lively History&quot; published in 2011 by Yale University Press, it is not.
&quot;In fact, the history of boredom is very long,&quot; he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom dating from the 1st century AD
We must also consider how we define boredom.
&quot;The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways,&quot; says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing published research and bringing the idea to a discussion group of 100, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of &quot;wanting, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fulfills you.&quot;
He states that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
Point out that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is &quot;the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly.&quot;
Boredom can sound terrifyingly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves.
Sometimes we think we are bored, when what really happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In their study &quot;The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,&quot; published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape. of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups listened to an unrelated television program at full volume in the next room, others listened to it at low volume so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program at low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; They had trouble concentrating, but they weren&#39;t sure why and attributed it to boredom.
&quot;When you&#39;re trying to focus on a difficult or interesting task, impaired attention can lead to boredom,&quot; said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the study&#39;s authors.
&quot;On the other hand, when you&#39;re doing something boring, like spotting faulty parts on a manufacturing line, distracting music can help keep you from getting bored.&quot;
&quot;In fact, we now know that moving around or scribbling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat boredom by making that person more physically alert.&quot;
&quot;Research shows that children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to be still,&quot; says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it&#39;s like to be bored at some point: a late plane, a monotonous speaker, an especially boring movie.
But some people are more prone to boredom than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a &quot;boredom tendency scale&quot; in the 1980s.
The scale includes questions like &quot;many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous&quot; and &quot;there are so many things that interest me that I don&#39;t have time to do everything.&quot;
Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more and more varied external stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of Human and Community Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day using a pager.
It found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he did know was that &quot;adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest levels,&quot; in large part because both children and adolescents are not given much control over what what do you want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, since, taken to the extreme, it can expose us to absurd physical risks, such as placing bets or indulging in substance use as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this question for more than two decades.
&quot;Boredom is the brain&#39;s way of telling you that you should be doing something else,&quot; says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain does not always know what is most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
&quot;So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may no longer be bored, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to dose,&quot; says Professor Fenske.
And &quot;that ability to dose applies to other situations,&quot; he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, he learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don&#39;t think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn&#39;t be too critical of him either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant buzz of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
&quot;In our view, we need to be more bored, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing a desire to be related to anything worthwhile,&quot; he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to unwind and enjoy some downtime.
&quot;In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated,&quot; he says, &quot;it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.&quot;
Colorado: no instruction book for new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old community college student and soccer player in southeastern Colorado, faces criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal across the state: possession of some marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September he and some friends were driving through Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and related items (misdemeanors each carrying a US $ 100 fine) informing him of the date of the trial.
&quot;They treat us like criminals,&quot; says Orozco.
And are they?
In the uncertain weeks following Colorado&#39;s vote to legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on law than location.
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana possession offenses are being dropped both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those 21 and older for small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law takes effect in the coming weeks.
But Colorado&#39;s more conservative district attorneys have vowed to move forward with open marijuana possession cases and are still subpoenaing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the Denver suburbs to the western mountains, are voting to block recently licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
&quot;This is all changing so rapidly that I don&#39;t know what&#39;s next,&quot; said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington state are also mulling over the issue.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of licenses for production, manufacture, distribution and sale; All of this before the deadline, December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or for worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
&quot;Colorado has a more regulated market, so I&#39;ll be a good guide,&quot; says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
&quot;There is no real precedent to serve as a model for us,&quot; he says.
Washington&#39;s law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves a year during which you will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during this period, such as how to balance the state&#39;s requirement to provide &quot;adequate access&quot; to licensed marijuana and its prohibition from conducting cannabis business within a radius of less than 300 meters from schools, parks, children&#39;s play areas or children&#39;s centers.
&quot;Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the greater Seattle area,&quot; says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On November 21, Oates, the Aurora Police Chief, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city attorney would stop bringing legal actions for misdemeanors for possession of marijuana to seniors. 21 years old and that the police would stop bringing charges against those crimes &quot;with immediate effect.&quot;
Police Chief Oates said they would enforce city regulations governing the cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes and that they would continue to target drug dealers and traffickers.
In Northern Colorado&#39;s Weld County, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers into deciding to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
&quot;Our office has the obligation to bring legal actions against those offenses that at the time they occurred were a crime,&quot; said Mr. Buck in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative on legalizing marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the county&#39;s largest city, are no longer citing adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession.
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,&quot; he said.
Despite 55 percent of voters supporting the measure, bringing recreational marijuana use within the government and the judicial system was never seen as easy.
Contradictory reactions throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
&quot;This is a cultural barrier with the district attorneys,&quot; says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents marijuana possession defendants and is a local spokesperson for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
&quot;They have spent so much time bringing people to court that they really still cannot accept that it is legal,&quot; he said.
As the first states to view small amounts of marijuana in the same way as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become the national test cases for drug legalization.
While attorneys and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving direction from the federal government, which still envisions the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates for marijuana legalization are hopeful that the Justice Department will back down.
Despite some notable arrests of patients and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has for the most part allowed medical marijuana businesses to exist in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
&quot;Although drug enforcement officers are not likely to break down doors to seize a small bag of drugs, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, allowed under the new law, to operate.&quot; said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration drug policy adviser.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level,&quot; explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
&quot;Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying for what the community voted for versus voting for what the state voted for. &quot;
Many questions arise in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: &quot;I was bullied out of Oxford for being a Tory&quot;
College students are not attacked for their views only now
I can&#39;t recall a time in my life when I wasn&#39;t dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and older brother had been to what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary-era Greek symposium that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s for a history degree, I had already packed my bags, sparking the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and started crying.
My friends were puzzled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had dropped out because I did not tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer AN Wilson jokingly announced that I had left because I was being forced to drink from chipped cups.
The truth was less fun.
I fled from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my fancy name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, which in the cradle of the supposed enlightenment was somewhat intolerant and barbarous: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative party.
You may be wondering what this is about now.
Well, various reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is facing similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of Conservative Party students is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them demanded the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College JCR say they are &quot;often seriously alienated, personally attacked and treated as unwelcome&quot; for their political views.
They want to create a seat on their college&#39;s equal opportunity committee to make sure they can express their views freely.
Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary called &quot;Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right&quot; about student politics and presenting the Tories as eccentric. and neo-Nazis.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, sporting a silver suit and a cane with a silver handle.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated like &quot;scapegoats&quot; for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the University of Nottingham Conservative Party Association, stated in a Sunday newspaper that &quot;there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume we are like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other. &quot;
Samuel Roberts, 21, a Corpus Christi history student who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is &quot;uncomfortable,&quot; while Stephanie Cherill, 19, OUCA president-elect, says the attitude from the members of the JCR towards the people who are of the center right has worsened.
&quot;This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of the members,&quot; he says.
During my first weeks at Oxford I was lonelier than one.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at an all-time high.
The year before, the university had voted to deny former student Margaret Thatcher an honorary degree following cuts in funding for Higher Education.
The atmosphere would have made any Stalinist shudder with terror.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I found that professors not only turned a blind eye to the mockery of conservative college students, but were willing to participate in it.
The politics of the miners&#39; strike, privatization and the government&#39;s opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wooden halls of the seminary.
The first one I attended had to translate French texts from the 18th century into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
&quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), &quot;please translate the first paragraph.&quot;
I didn&#39;t say one.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like sponge cake, knew well how to expel bad bile.
&quot;Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?&quot; He asked.
The other college kids laughed.
My eyes burned from the tears I tried to hold back.
&quot;I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you&#39;re not too busy meeting people,&quot; Pitt growled.
I went back to my room like a lost soul.
That night I sat alone at the university for dinner; then I felt a light pat on the back.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
&quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said kindly.
&quot;I&#39;m afraid this is how it goes.
They pick on anyone suspected of being Tory.
It&#39;s very complicated for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be Labor. &quot;
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to hide it.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick proved useless.
A freshman in Philosophy, Politics and Economics who had, paradoxically, studied at Eton, said: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated. &quot;
Other students adopted that little ditty.
I became the dirty pervert.
&quot;How do Tories have sex?&quot; Asked one.
&quot;They beat each other up, right?&quot;
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 60s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I go Labor and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History stationed at my college.
They hated him for being not only from the Conservative party, but also Thatcher&#39;s foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote her speeches to him.
He was hardly around.
He detested the place because it considered it provincial and insignificant and because of its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
&quot;You are not going to be happy here,&quot; he told me.
I began to commute daily from Oxford to my parents&#39; house in London, finding refuge with my more open metropolitan-minded family and friends.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.
He did not believe me.
When he was studying there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
&quot;But it is the best place in the world,&quot; he said sadly.
&quot;They would never do that, not there among my beloved dream spiers.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude. &quot;
His aching eyes began to cloud.
&quot;Give it another chance.
I&#39;m sure they did it just to joke.
It would break my heart if you left it. &quot;
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional stamina was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another history professor had hinted, in complete seriousness, that I was an &quot;enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had &quot;brainwashed&quot; me and called them &quot;stupid old men.&quot;
The truce was short-lived.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was huddled inside in fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left I packed my bag and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak crybaby.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only trained 14 Conservative party prime ministers but, to this day, hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
&quot;Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety&quot;
On the occasion of the exhibition &quot;Valentino: Master of Sewing&quot;, which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized him during the inauguration of &quot;Valentino: Master of Sewing&quot;, a tremendous retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his &quot;maison&quot; over the last 50 years.
&quot;I love this palace,&quot; he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is &quot;il signore&quot; Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the best of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from humble couturier in the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to idol of the international &quot;jet-set&quot;.
There is nothing wrong with being in love with royalty.
&quot;At least they don&#39;t put out their cigarette butts on your gorgeous carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do,&quot; says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
&quot;We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad&quot;, explains the ex-wife of &quot;Heini&quot; Thyssen, close to forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the couturier.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were twenty people, among whom were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the apartment, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything its spirit was seen and felt.
&quot;He made each of the guests feel important and loved,&quot; recalls the &quot;top model&quot;, who began working with him during Haute Couture Week in Paris in 1995.
&quot;It never goes out of style because its designs are works of art,&quot; he concludes.
Parade of lineage
Garavani&#39;s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-reciprocated loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous sixty meter long catwalk that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade down the catwalk to contemplate a dreamy &quot;audience&quot; that she wears Valentino masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the wardrobe that Monica Vitti wore in &quot;La Notte&quot;, or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this public of mannequins, names such as Sibilla from Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia from Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the couturier, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, &quot;impossible to forget&quot;.
I remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a gillette vest and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
&quot;It was a gift he gave me,&quot; says Naty Abascal, one of the designer&#39;s muses.
&quot;I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty,&quot; adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors you use, they have great light and are &quot;donors&quot; to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d&#39;Arenberg can also not forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of reaching the age and the occasion to be able to wear one of her evening gowns ...
The time finally came in the late 90s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear to a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with a ruffled skirt, a draped corsage, and a strapless neckline.
&quot;It was a dream come true,&quot; says Rodrigo d&#39;Arenberg&#39;s widow.
&quot;Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timelessness,&quot; explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D&#39;Arenberg keeps her dressmaker&#39;s party dresses with &quot;the utmost care ... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories that it carries.&quot;
The &quot;king&quot; of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller&#39;s wedding dress at her wedding to Pablo of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 &quot;ragazze&quot; (as the couturier calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk suit encrusted with pearls, twelve different types of lace, and a four-and-a-half meter train.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority on the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone in haute couture at the end of the 20th century, &quot;the return of the clients of high society.&quot;
Cloudy for years with the &quot;savoir-être&quot; of the elite, now Valentino is his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L&#39;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
&quot;I have always been struck by his refinement, his calm, his neat and perfect appearance,&quot; acknowledges D&#39;Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d&#39;Orsay.
He was at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
&quot;He was impeccable, time does not pass for him.&quot;
If a princess says it ...
The toughest job in the world: Kawah Ijen&#39;s human mules
For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who make a living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to go down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas that emanates from the bowels of the Earth solidifies when it comes into contact with the air.
After uprooting large sulfur rocks, weighing about 70 kilograms in total, he carries them in two bamboo baskets that he carries on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to ascend at a snail&#39;s pace, keeping their balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall. the cliff.
They know that any misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell down the cliffs of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 euro cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
Once at the top, they make their way through the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, wearily carrying the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
&quot;As the normal thing is to carry 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,&quot; explains Anto, who usually carries out three shipments a day.
It takes three hours each and ends up being ground, but they allow you to raise 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a pittance for such an inhuman effort, it is triple what he would earn on the field.
&quot;The miners&#39; wage is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)&quot;, clarifies the porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the cut was not that hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a compelling reason that, in Indonesia, It is as forceful as sulfur: &quot;I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought her to Java to convert to Islam.&quot;
Anto has asthma, is breathing heavily, coughing constantly, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At 27, Anto has been playing his skin for three years at Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to take its toll despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, is breathing hard, coughs constantly, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
It is the price you must pay to achieve your dream.
&quot;I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,&quot; he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this charming and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead does the work of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden cabin with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the dark.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, shining a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 porters carry the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs nor does it supply any equipment to the porters, who are already working on their own account.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) camera surcharge that, together with the 15,000 rupee (1.2 euros) entry, the rangers of this natural park charge tourists who come to visit. photograph the volcano and its human mules.
&quot;This job is for beasts and not for people,&quot; protests Madrusin, a burly 42-year-old porter who has been at Kawah Ijen for three decades, since he left school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will endure working &quot;as long as he can&quot; because he needs the money to educate his three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases ... beyond, of course, of his usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, knee pain and shoulder sores, which have been deformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can already only carry 50 kilos at 53 years old.
Every day, he and his colleagues remove 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away along a goat path through the undergrowth.
&quot;I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life,&quot; proclaims Unainik, opening his mouth wide, where several teeth are missing.
Of her five children, the oldest, 30, also works carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the toughest jobs in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and the cost of property and education for not having children.
&quot;Singapore&#39;s population needs to grow.&quot;
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, let&#39;s do our civic duty and create life!
It may seem implausible that these verses are part of a peppermint ad, but despite that - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as &quot;Let&#39;s put a bao (bun) in the oven&quot; to laugh at Singapore&#39;s birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes that the ad will bring attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill &quot;their national duty.&quot;
This is purely internet stuff, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world at reproducing ourselves, so we felt that this was an issue we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn&#39;t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don&#39;t we get as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to write a rap?
1.2 children
The one that doesn&#39;t take it so lightly is the Singaporean government.
It spends $ 1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $ 15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
Singapore&#39;s birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don&#39;t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says it is due to &quot;better education&quot; and &quot;a wider range of career opportunities.&quot;
&quot;That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family,&quot; he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise in singleness, and to a delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the declining population has created resentment among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where barely disguised xenophobia is rife against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
Rising immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore&#39;s ruling party experienced its worst electoral result since independence last year.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher fees and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a nation&#39;s economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs, and immigration policies, the Singapore example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government tries not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has started to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has come to control the number of small apartments, known as &quot;shoe boxes&quot;, that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there are concerns that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says his &quot;shoe boxes&quot; sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units sell out for days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step toward increasing the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans who work in the downtown financial district it appears that they will not have much of an effect.
&quot;People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are putting it off,&quot; says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
&quot;But for me it is important to have my own money and time,&quot; says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and the cost of property and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans have the last word.
The private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is about the quality of private or &quot;the area of private life that has the right to protect from any interference&quot;.
What is private for a minor under 16 years of age?
How do you apply this definition in your daily life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed by airing situations on the Internet that you surely would not share offline?
elPeriódico interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the Internet.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with &quot;something very mine&quot;, on a personal level, and &quot;in the username and password&quot;, when they applied it to social networks.
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t upload my deepest secrets to a post,&quot; says ten-year-old Jorge when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
&quot;They are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not everyone,&quot; he says.
On FB I upload pretty pictures or games.
I also entertain myself with my acquaintances.
&quot;I would not share a photo that is not mine, or someone who is making a fool of himself,&quot; he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to post obscene pictures, nude people, crimes, or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are related.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
&quot;I don&#39;t know if they answer me, I just upload them,&quot; he adds.
&quot;Social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,&quot; he says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Nor would he listen to someone who recommended him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,&quot; he says.
According to the boy, no one has come forward or asked for his home address or phone number.
&quot;If they pressured me or demanded it, I simply remove them from my account,&quot; he acknowledges.
José became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of one of my friends was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
&quot;He never knew who it was,&quot; he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
&quot;It just put privacy on it.&quot;
It then explains a series of steps to configure the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I don&#39;t like him or I want him.
&quot;Although I know that this is cyberbullying,&quot; he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
&quot;Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites the rules of the game changed,&quot; he says.
Porras points out that the academic Marc Prensky, master&#39;s degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Nativos e Inmigrantes Digitales, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who were born with technology.
&quot;We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we are still learning,&quot; he says.
He comments that the issue is complex, &quot;because we are asking them to have a defined criterion about what should or should not be disseminated, published or said at an age that maturity is not enough for that.&quot;
&quot;Also that they are selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,&quot; he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what privacy is to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
&quot;Telling them not to do it is useless,&quot; he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things that you would not tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what the others post about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more, does everyone need to know what you are doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
&quot;One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same should be in social networks,&quot; he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents read social media policies thoroughly.
By understanding each of the items they have a solid foundation to discuss with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
&quot;For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,&quot; he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of &quot;do not talk to strangers.&quot;
Unasur Summit ends without making the Lima Declaration public
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven presidents in attendance.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency indicated at the beginning that they were going to hand it over after the closing, but later they affirmed that in at some point it will be published on the Peruvian government website.
When consulted for the text, they indicated that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists&#39; access to information on the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message &quot;private session, restricted audio&quot; was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assisting presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but it is Humala&#39;s pronouncement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the III South America-Arab Countries Summit (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Declaration of Lima that they had previously announced was not disseminated either.
On the official ASPA website, it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made an effort to ensure that there were secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the obtaining of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling from the Court of The Hague to settle a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the arguments of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
&quot;We will abide by and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today,&quot; said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
&quot;Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful solution of disputes, international treaties and tribunals,&quot; added Piñera, and greeted Humala with a handshake, along with to the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered seriously erroneous .
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take &quot;important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the residency agreements.&quot;
He reported that actions are being promoted to improve &quot;cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and against transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, access to the internet at low prices in all corners of South America, and provide joint and efficient risks of natural disasters &quot;.
With a Europe in crisis, &quot;the economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples,&quot; Humala added.
&quot;We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,&quot; said the Peruvian president in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
Likewise, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
&quot;We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for his reincorporation to the Union of South American Nations,&quot; from which he is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good relations between neighbors, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before beginning his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to respectfully discuss the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
&quot;Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,&quot; Santos said.
&quot;We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua,&quot; he stressed.
&quot;With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him to handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,&quot; Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday where they plan to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Likewise, as part of the summit, the defense ministers of the bloc met previously to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense matters in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay make up UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
&quot;South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship&quot;: Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, affirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which &quot;South America, in this case, must learn from Europe.&quot;
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, declared to the state TV Peru that Europeans &quot;killed themselves in World War II&quot; and in other conflicts, &quot;but now they are practically a homeland. &quot;
In that sense, he defended the project of establishing South American citizenship that the member countries of Unasur encourage.
&quot;We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers through any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past,&quot; he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favor of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on rights humans.
Those who teach never commit to anything and, on the other hand, we South Americans sign everything.
&quot;It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States,&quot; he said, referring to the political asylum given by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he is not sorry for that decision because with it he has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his &quot;deep democratic and human rights values.&quot;
He added that, at the time, &quot;there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and his process was not respected.&quot;
He also criticized the Swedish courts for demanding that he submit to interrogation in their territory for an alleged sexual crime when &quot;Swedish law itself allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.&quot;
Correa said there is a risk that Assange&#39;s physical and mental health will deteriorate.
&quot;I have not spoken with him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,&quot; said the Ecuadorian president.
What there is is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate from being locked in a small space without being able to exercise outdoors.
&quot;That complicates the health of any person,&quot; he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a safe conduct that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there has been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
&quot;The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange&#39;s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European instances,&quot; he mentioned.
And he opined that &quot;if Great Britain gives the safe conduct tomorrow this will end.&quot;
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype this problem will end tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and clarified that what he does not tolerate is &quot;mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which undermine freedom of expression.&quot;
&quot;The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said.
In this regard, he congratulated himself that these journalists are no longer &quot;neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador,&quot; and he advanced that if re-elected &quot;he will deepen the revolution to continue on the right path and direction.&quot;
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto of Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body &quot;must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup-covered legalities&quot; because in reality &quot;it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy &quot;.
The Ecuadorian president also considered &quot;perfectly pertinent&quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment this ruling is not being complied with.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They have to be processed broadly to overcome them and move on.
He also trusted in a good conclusion to the litigation over maritime limits that Peru and Chile maintain in the same court and said that &quot;it is correct for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries agree to accept a ruling no matter how hard it may be.&quot;
In reference to the eventuality that he appears as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said that he sees that possibility &quot;with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard.&quot;
Correa assured that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador&#39;s, that socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
&quot;My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility,&quot; he said.
If I win, it would be my last term in office and from there we left public life.
If we lose the same.
&quot;It is a decision,&quot; he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that the campaign to return to Cuba was expected to pass.
&quot;It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez,&quot; he commented.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test result was confirmed: AIDS positive.
&quot;It was as if a bomb had dropped on me&quot;, he refers to recalling the moment of the announcement, which the doctor tried to make &quot;softer&quot;, without evident success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it; so hard that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him &quot;because he had a cut.&quot;
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, &quot;depleted&quot; their immune systems, and they are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, &quot;the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same, &quot;said the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and expert in HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system they present patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with a better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a CD4 count of 200 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4s.
In simple words, the above means that whoever receives a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, under these terms &quot;as long as they remain in control, they will be able to live without problems until they are 75 years old,&quot; explained the interviewee.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the appearance From AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths until May of this year; However, it is ensured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not one of access to treatment.
This is how I envision it, this is how it has happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medicine, the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He gave a conclusive fact: &quot;Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what must be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, tests have to be offered. detection in a massive way, to all the people who require it &quot;.
In his proposal, specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida) coincide, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who came to have the test in a private laboratory, only motivated because a friend had done it and, despite At his young age, he was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi&#39;s sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die and do not want to know anything.
&quot;If I&#39;m going to die, I&#39;d better burst three times a week,&quot; they say not in my case.
The change was for the better, I eat well, I exercise, I take medications.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
&quot;I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I take care of myself and the other person&quot;, listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, they are afraid.
That they get tested, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone else, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are great gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the cause around HIV.
And the biggest is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task &quot;the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those who today still do not have access to a condom, &quot;he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
&quot;What do you want them for?&quot; It is a common question, with derision and value judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to expose themselves, said the communicator.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective division; that the condoms are not only behind the counters and those hundred are in dispensers of public toilets in the places that young people frequent.
It is not encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González responded when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms in his Administration.
&quot;This is not sexuality, it is best to bring condoms to those who already practice sexual activity,&quot; he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is 4th national in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50 thousand people may be living with HIV since for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by a United States appeals court a ruling that ignores the restructuring of Grupo Vitro&#39;s debt achieved through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, the scenario sets a disastrous precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country that has solvency problems .
It would seem, then, that the procedures to guarantee the survival of the firms that Mexican laws allow are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes, contrary to international conventions.
In practical terms, the support for the sentence issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy court for the northern district of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of seizure of their properties abroad. The brave.
However, the resolution opens the door for the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, alleging three inconsistencies.
From the outset, while the judge in the case indicates that creditors must be governed by the Bankruptcy Law of the United States, the court of appeals of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the commercial bankruptcy processed in Mexico.
The first point would imply ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, towards that end, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created, placing the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Second, the ruling establishes that without the intercompany vote, the debts that Vitro&#39;s subsidiaries had with their parent company recognized in the critical mass of the bankruptcy, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro&#39;s was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts endorsed the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcies.
What is certain, moreover, is that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway Vitro&#39;s creditors who fought against it in the United States Courts, that is, &quot;vulture&quot; funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, they will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 on the sidelines of the serious economic crisis that the United States faced, hitting the country with its tail.
For now, the firm of the González Sada family will file an appeal for reconsideration before the court of appeals itself so that the vote reaches the full court, that is, the five magistrates, since only three voted.
If this is not successful, the appeal of Cerciorare will be claimed, which requires the review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
What is serious about the case is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government under the figure of amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the Court&quot;), in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Bankruptcy Law is detailed. Mercantile, noting that it was released in accordance with the agreements signed by both countries to tie it with Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Law of the United States.
Furthermore, it is pointed out that the country abided by the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, that is, the rules established for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-way carom: they hit Vitro and they hit the country.
Balance sheet
Asleep for several months the complaints placed on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación unions against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Aviators&#39; Trade Union Association has already found the bottleneck.
The instance headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just presented a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General&#39;s Office on an operation carried out by the businessman to extract 198 million pesos from the trust F / 589 of Banco IXE, in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
The resources would have been channeled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Close to the Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend in a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, of a colossal sales and distribution center for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a suitable housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental bullring that destroyed part of protected areas and poses the mother of all threats against the industry.
ACTA died
The government ignored a demand from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility, considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long term homex
In an effort to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, the home developer Homex is placing Stock Certificates for 500 million pesos on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical ones offering to pay interest every 28 days.
Competival is born
Made up of the companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a consortium with the corporate name Competival has just been created, whose objective will be the market of services for the software clusters of Central and South America.
Investments in the matter exceed 1.5 trillion dollars.
Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes: &quot;Basketball has been my life&quot;
Basketball globetrotter Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes was linked to the sport of the board for more than 60 years and, thanks to it, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as broad a mental recollection of local basketball history as Héctor &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes does.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, was as a minor category player, National Superior Basketball player, attorney and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Federation.
&quot;I wore many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 90s,&quot; Reyes recalled during a visit to Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
&quot;Basketball has been my life.&quot;
Reyes is not exaggerating in making that claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his extensive career, attest to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all of them, the ones that he treasures with the greatest emotion are those that recall his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years serving as co-manager or manager of the franchise.
&quot;Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy championships since 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or manager.
They were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy&#39;s debut year at BSN.
From then on, &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz took over, who was a great administrator, &quot;Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had coached here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: &quot;I have a very strong player for you, 6&quot; 7 &quot;tall.
You want it?&quot;
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
He enjoyed the championship of the Cowboys with Gausse, but already at a distance, because by 1988 he was already the federative boss.
By that time he preferred to enjoy his performances and those of Mincy on the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the 1989 Pre-Olympic in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth and it should have been bronze if not for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that group from the 1990 World Cup the best National Team you&#39;ve ever seen?
He&#39;s among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave the United States team a fight, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the World Cup.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and &quot;Piculín&quot; (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) &quot;Toñito&quot; Colón and James Carter young, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &quot;Quijote&quot; Morales, who had not been able to be in 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as &quot;Canito&quot; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youthful Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended due to the trouble at the Pan American in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that was Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculín did.
And that&#39;s not counting his career in the different leagues he played.
Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader?
That is very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young people, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 90&#39;s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What was left for you to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, the boys from Ponce will only play in their area and will only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officials and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch videos of music from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as &quot;JR&quot;., In the television series &quot;Dallas&quot;, in the who embodied an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon JR Ewing on the television series &quot;Dallas&quot; became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as JR in a new season of &quot;Dallas,&quot; died Friday afternoon of complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by the Warner Bros. production house. from &quot;Dallas&quot;.
&quot;Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the iconic role that he loved best,&quot; the family said.
Larry&#39;s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he passed away in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to everyone he met.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving, and talented, and I will miss him terribly.
&quot;He was an original person and lived life to the fullest,&quot; Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
Years before &quot;Dallas,&quot; Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy &quot;I Dream of Jeannie,&quot; aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he meets an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his home.
He was also the protagonist of two comedies that aired for a short time, &quot;The Good Life&quot; (NBC, 1971-72) and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in &quot;The Group,&quot; &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; and &quot;Primary Colors.&quot;
But it was his masterful portrayal of the charmingly obnoxious JR that led Hagman to his peak.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit ran from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase &quot;Who shot JR?&quot;, Thought to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman was almost assassinated, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risked in gambling houses.
It also helped give the series a record viewership at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made &quot;Dallas&quot; the second-most-watched entertainment program in history, behind the end of &quot;MASH&quot; in 1983. which had 50 million viewers.
It was JR&#39;s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
JR got her pregnant and then threatened to brand her as a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as an insatiable crook with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and cheating husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), into a hospital.
&quot;I know what I want on JR&#39;s headstone,&quot; Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, &quot;Here lies honest citizen JR Ewing.&quot;
This is the only deal that lost.
Original series co-star Victoria Principal remembered Hagman on Friday as &quot;huge, on and off the screen.&quot;
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, that we were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of &quot;Dallas&quot; were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
The recording of five of the chapters for the second season had already finished and a sixth was in process, the network reported.
There was no immediate statement from Warner or TNT on how the series will handle the loss of Hagman.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan.&quot;
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his hand at the theatrical stages in New York in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met and married the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs &quot;Hello Darlin &#39;: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life&quot;.
&quot;I didn&#39;t put anything in there that I believed would hurt someone or affect them in any way,&quot; he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he became an organ donation advocate and volunteered at a hospital to assist fearful patients.
&quot;I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and afterwards,&quot; he indicated in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like &quot;don&#39;t be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they will be fine.&quot;
He was also an activist against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
They begin a course that explores the &quot;End of the world&quot;
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the &quot;long countdown&quot; of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, which has been clung to many people as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff some have called &quot;debt rmageddon&quot; and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end of the times believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
&quot;I didn&#39;t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has ever been,&quot; Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University (NJ) this week.
If you analyze what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with the apocalyptic mindset.
And he is not the only professor offering courses on the &quot;end of the world&quot; this semester, in theory the last in history.
At Temple, Adjunct Professor Barry Vacker is teaching &quot;Media, Culture, and the End of the World.&quot;
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
&quot;We look at why these ideas proliferate over time,&quot; he said, and how they offer what-if scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month students analyzed apocalyptic-themed movies and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
&quot;I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible,&quot; Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled only &quot;The End of the World. &quot;.
&quot;We didn&#39;t add &#39;2012&#39; to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn&#39;t end,&quot; Restall said.
Despite the &quot;impending doom,&quot; students must study, generate projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work &quot;until the very night the world is supposed to end,&quot; Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
&quot;It was saturated in two hours,&quot; Restall said of his high GPA course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
&quot;I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,&quot; said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old Religion and Sociology major from Haddonfield, NJ, at Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old Nursing and Psychology major, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
&quot;I&#39;ve never heard of a class that could teach that,&quot; he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - let alone a professor - said they believed in the expiration date of December 21.
&quot;Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredited it,&quot; said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old Temple senior from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it&#39;s just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
&quot;Elsewhere people don&#39;t think about this,&quot; he said.
In mostly the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at La Salle University who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, was quick to respond to the question of whether he knew of any &quot;end of the world&quot; courses there.
&quot;The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world,&quot; he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that many doomsday days have been talked about over the years, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, &quot;people will immediately start thinking about the next date&quot; or philosophizing that the 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to &quot;end of the world&quot; parties.
&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll call some friends over for a laugh together,&quot; said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
