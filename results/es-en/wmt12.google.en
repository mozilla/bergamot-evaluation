Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Penal Code in which opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko is sentenced.
The amendment would open the doors to the ex-prime minister&#39;s release, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing an agreement with Russia disadvantageous to Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet final, the appeal court is required to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have been raised about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code with which the former prime minister was sentenced was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for its approval.
Libya&#39;s victory
The story of Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no war.
It remains to define who is the winner
As is customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of determining whether they are moderate or radical
The National Transitional Council has enforced the traditional law, the sharia, which we already know to a certain extent.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because thieves will have their hands cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate themselves and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of by the person of the dictator, the society, made up of warrior tribes, will be united by the Qur&#39;an.
An order will be established in Libya that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and it probably did not suit the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is surprising that the Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of the infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, the NATO attacks were not led by an American general, but great be Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When looking for victors in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shootout used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally with no guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, it is not a problem for the locals to expel the &quot;crusaders&quot;
But, without occupation, will the oil companies be able to get hold of Libyan black gold with only good words?
It is quite possible that not, but it may be that finally the West can boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of the sharia do not cross us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are hunting the investor seeker
A statistical whirlwind has swept Europe
Individual states have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the inter-quarterly period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany&#39;s GDP grew by an expected 0.5%, France&#39;s by 0.4%
Both countries have released the data for the second four-month period, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% ( the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the inter-quarterly period, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to the ČSÚ the trend towards a gradual deceleration in the growth of economic development is conformed.
The results are even worse than analysts&#39; forecasts.
Main events:
Year-on-year, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but has stagnated on a four-month basis.
In the third quarter, the German economy, based on previous data and seasonally recalculated, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analysts&#39; expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen 5.2% year-on-year.
The interest on its ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest on Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation also begins to affect Austria, Holland, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on Czech 10-year bonds remains at 4%, although the situation is worsening in the area.
Voices are being raised in Germany saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs qualify for the Eurocup.
They won 1: 0 and celebrate the qualification with a 200 million bonus.
The soccer team fulfills the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to excellent Čech and brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jiráček, the victory was 1: 0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended itself fantastically against the attacks of the home team, so that they will not miss the European championship appointment.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the match in detail in a detailed report.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the home team towards the end, and also to the excellent play of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won 1: 0 in Montenegro and celebrates their move to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two losers of the match were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who missed two big chances.
In addition, thanks to the brilliant Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup appointment, so that the coffers of national football will receive a bonus of approximately 200 million crowns.
Right from the first minutes there was a good offensive game.
Both teams insisted only on maintaining the lines and played only around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kicks to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense was able to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country&#39;s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country&#39;s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began to pray Tuesday at noon outside the facilities and later chanted slogans of death to the United States and Israel.
Several hundred university students in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday formed human shields around the nuclear technology center that works with uranium.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country&#39;s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is striving for nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then launched slogans of death against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the objective of which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan power station, but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched, would be reached.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, according to current research.
The importance of the environment where one grows for a healthy development of the person is once again demonstrated, as well as the models that serve as reference.
At the table, obsessed children eat, for example, sausages at least twice as often as children from normal-weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had eaten fried potatoes the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&quot;.
In the families of overweight children there is no custom of practicing sports, which is applicable to the majority of today&#39;s families, where only 15% of the children answered that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey conducted on 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last school year and almost 900 basic education children from all over the Czech Republic participated in it.
It was already the second edition of the &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&quot; program, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12 thousand children from 4th to 8th grade have participated in the project.
A proper diet and plenty of exercise as a family are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obese children.
&quot;Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals a day according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet&quot;, picks up one of the results of the survey .
Without breakfast but with sausage for dinner
The specialists warn that, in a healthy development, details are also important, which also count, such as having a set time for breakfast as a family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was discovering that in 10% of households they do not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obese children, unhealthy potato chips are consumed much more frequently.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet soda every day (70%).
As a general rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study allowed the chosen kids (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
&quot;The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal.&quot;
Her favorite foods include pasta, meat, and sweets.
&quot;The popularity of sweet sodas is especially alarming,&quot; warned in the final report of the study.
Pasta takes the cake as the main meal, followed closely by poultry.
Children practically always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
&quot;In the control group of study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program&quot; Obesity is not a coincidence &quot;, in many cases there was an important change in favor of the principles of a healthy diet &quot;, is pointed out in the results of the study.
It is striking, for example, regarding sweet soft drinks, where many children would begin to prefer normal and running water.
The children would also choose poultry and fish more frequently in the questionnaire for the main meal and would restrict the consumption of sweet foods and those derived from flour.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, maintain the professionals
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how this would go.
Conferences by three professionals in the field, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in show business.
And it will be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
This time we have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is short-necked, someone has a slim figure without the proper curves, and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften broad shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
They have given us certain tricks on how to make the body of women of the type Jennifer López stand out, with huge breasts and hips but a narrow waist and at the same time not dress her in a too defiant way
If, for example, the difference between the waist and the hips is such that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth having at least one extra piece of fabric sewn to measure.
You will certainly not regret it, because the clothes that fit perfectly are priceless.
With a tailored skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing at the waist, etc.
The slim body can be allowed to wear clothes with pleats, embellishments, embroidery or draping.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am happy that I have the whole week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I&#39;m afraid that with the assigned task, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who will have to design two costumes: one for the day and one for the night.
You have to take into account the current look, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
It was my turn to &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, perhaps you know her from the Victoria&#39;s Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately will have put on a hundred kilos (please, take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
The dresses we have to cut them from the magazines or look for them on the internet and print them, and then make them graphically.
The moodboard, which is what the complete result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of the styling.
The stylist, therefore, does not only dress physically, but also takes care, for example, of product pages in magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about all this.
But all this is for Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three invited specialists animated the conference on Saturday with information on all types of bodies.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka, and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
The variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a raincoat (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in the classic style with jeans and a T-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with high heels and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just roll it up and raise your neck to get a totally different image.
&quot;Play with it,&quot; he insisted.
What I value the most is the following advice: &quot;To start working, you first need to know all the rules.&quot;
&quot;Then you can break them,&quot; said Jakub.
At last it is clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if later it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in stock than he intends to photograph.
Thus, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), at least fifteen must be prepared, ready to use.
And also that the photos the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that image and style alone are, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is not yet a clear trend to use the services of stylists.
Even famous people find it useless (my skills are enough for me, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate a size very different from their real (smaller) size.
Then it only remains to guggle and find out if the gossip magazines have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has gained / lost weight, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to orient himself in fashion, but that he has to understand the outfit.
During your work, above all you must communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he does not undermine himself, he defends their opinions.
&quot;When a director hires you to classify her wardrobe and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can&#39;t just take and throw away everything that was there and say: &#39;oh what a horror&#39;&quot;.
&quot;Find at least a couple of things that you can weigh and recommend so that someone can put them on,&quot; says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit into the so-called &quot;placovka&quot;, that is, the job bank.
This is fixed around the waist and all the necessary tools are there.
They are objects such as scissors, such as scissors, lint removers, or safety pins. There is also nylon thread (which is used by the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special clips for attaching garments in the front, if it is larger (pins and other types of clips are not allowed, they could damage the fabric), or a sewing kit.
In order not to remain passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to coat the soles of our shoes.
Even during photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole could be damaged and even more so the exterior.
And we did nothing but coat and coat.
We couldn&#39;t touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to accidentally damage them.
So you had to be very clever.
Mario has given me joy by praising my work without reservation.
The truth is that I am not very good at those skills.
This is just a small part of everything we have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that dedicating myself to styling at a professional level is not a rosy way, but I do not care exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run you compete throughout America.
Review
A trip, initially carefree, is complicated by a series of improper carelessness of a routine trip during the morning shift.
To a certain extent, expectations were met, but this is useless, if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new installment, to which The Run is added to the title, aroused great expectations before its premiere.
It promised that it would give new life to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, as a result of what was shown, it appears as a game that should not end up being an action genre without more.
We are also curious to know how the inserted scenes would look, where the main character gets out of the car and walks on his own feet.
As is often the case with NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total count, points are lost due to absurd mistakes, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In reality they cannot even be called errors, but rather it is the incomprehensible reluctance of the programmers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; To solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race all over America.
You get behind the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place along a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
In this way, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous installments in the series.
Therefore, it is nothing to write home about.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high mountains covered with snow produce a very pleasant visual effect.
Also, careers are diversified from time to time by an outlier.
Thus, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you have to be careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that is enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required number of rivals (the normal in a classic race), then you try to gain time (timed classic duel) and then a duel against a single opponent awaits you.
In the midst of all this, the police sometimes appear, doing nothing but making things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right moment.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you might expect (there are only three in particular).
But the end result is positive, because this element is not annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big thing, but it cannot be said that it is bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can already look elsewhere.
But for a race designed with a lot of action, this style of driving is quite suitable, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, everything in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer true for collisions.
From games of this type it is not expected that it will recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
It is typical that, when overtaking very tight or circulating the car with normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or even totally destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that, when you have an accident or go off the track, the game restores you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race there are only five available resets.
If you consume all of them, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it is only a help in case something does not go well, but it is not very reliable.
Sometimes not even the reset helps, only learning the given stage by heart helps.
A great disadvantage of the game is that the same events are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself somewhere &quot;civil&quot; vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or you arrive five minutes earlier or later.
This makes you mad especially in situations, when you see that two cars that are going to meet in opposite directions, your opponent overtakes without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It is the same when you arrive, because it is programmed because the &quot;surprise&quot; will always happen right under your nose.
The opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, regardless of the moment, you will always be overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
Also this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at whatever cost.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming from the front, so at first you can make the car mush.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you right away.
And it&#39;s a shame, because although the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and action-packed, so that often it is not possible to follow in detail what is happening or where.
And it really doesn&#39;t matter, if the idea with fifty exclusive tracks gets the credit or the qualifying in the race so that boredom does not fit, or anything else.
An unusual idea is changing cars during races.
You have to be attentive to the gas pumps on the side of the road, because right there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases what you have will suffice.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for straight highways and exotic supercars for technical driving, for example on curvy mountain roads.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a parallel challenge thread, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know from the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which is useful for both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, there is an online Autolog function connected, which compares your results with those of other players and makes other community functions available.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you get to the subway tunnel (pass), where you start running in the dark along the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km / h (pass) and, suddenly, the metro convoy arrives from behind and takes you straight ahead.
In the newsroom we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or if the authors really take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects are in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
Well, what a pity that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This especially affects accidents where many participants are involved, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to appeal to most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category &quot;each from his father and his mother&quot;, but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for its music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not over.
Fun is guaranteed, but be prepared because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the force of airport reflectors.

The ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for being naysayers and Eurosceptics.
&quot;The Lisbon treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions&quot;
&quot;I did not expect an all-out war to break out.&quot;
&quot;It will last five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a bit, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles&quot;, this is how the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena, began with conviction her lecture at the Faculty of Law. Vicenová.
How not to take seriously his motto &quot;clearly and openly about Europe&quot;, which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many speakers from the Faculty of Law of the U. Carolina.
Vicenová also praised the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
&quot;The first thing comes the criticisms, that if he is bland, a gray official, capable of assuming any role, but I have to say that he left everyone puzzled, because he assumes their roles perfectly.&quot;
&quot;He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go.&quot;
The new position of representative of Foreign Policy and Security is explained from the question: &quot;Who is this EU? What number can I call it?&quot; It is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union in the face of States such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us Olomouc cheese
Vicenová has also addressed the agenda followed, continues and will continue the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, solved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: &quot;a good fuss&quot;, not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, it is necessary to approve the budget for seven years of the EU, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and which less? That is something that will be on the agenda for the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she arrived in Europe: &quot;About Europe clearly&quot;.
&quot;The truth is that I do not like ugly abbreviations, foreign words or slang that people do not understand.&quot;
&quot;How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented, curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban us from Olomouc cheese?&quot;
It also aims to get more out of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones.
Furthermore, he regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault lies with a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the little support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, it highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
&quot;Believe me that when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches me, a Frenchman next to me says:&quot; What, have you already arranged, those of the Visegrad Group? &quot; no grace &quot;.
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, await harsh new regulations on budgetary policy for the Member States.
The concept of the two speeds is perceived as something very real, if not more, in Europe, more than the new one of &quot;the European Federation&quot;.
&quot;We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.&quot;
&quot;We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure.&quot;
&quot;It was said for the first time that only the countries that want to cooperate and those that don&#39;t, stay out.&quot;
&quot;These procedures will be more and more and will reinforce the Europe of the two speeds&quot;, Vicenová is expected.
In this sense, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all issues that affect the entire EU must be discussed among the member states, not only among the members of the EU. Eurozone.

If someone were looking for a term that would define IBM&#39;s strategy with great precision, the closest one would be &quot;long term.&quot;
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet, a hundred years have passed since its founding.
The basis for this long-term character was laid by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the motto that many problems in the world can be solved if people are willing to think.
His motto &quot;Think!&quot; it became his seal, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully crafted company culture.
&quot;For us, IBM means long-term thinking, continuous movement into the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it stayed true to its basic principles, but without fear of changes around it.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We look forward to further prosperity in our second century, &quot;said current company CEO Samuel J. Palmisano on its anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, took care of his employees as the businessman from Ba ela in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American workers to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that it rewarded the best inventors and salespeople.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in customer relationships.
Right from the beginning the company knew how to discover talents (being one of the first companies in the world to end any type of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM&#39;s current plan, whereby Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has participated in so-called virtual meetings, online brainstorming, from which countless future strategies and innovations emerge.
It is not surprising that there are plenty of ideas, since almost half a million people work at the firm.
A reputable institution
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
&quot;From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution rather than technology company,&quot; says Harvard Business School professor economist and author of the IBM book Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
&quot;IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users,&quot; says George Colony of the consultancy Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between going into business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or the &quot;Big Green&quot; - as it is known in the US familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (it develops both hardware and software, infrastructures and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the highest number of patents of all North American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
His inventions include the ATM, payment cards, swaps, barcodes, and floppy disks.
IBM will invoice this year 220 billion dollars. This year it has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking at the future
Not all products and innovations just satisfy the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS / 2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
&quot;If your business is based on moving forward, you cannot emotionally anchor yourself in the past,&quot; acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this reason, IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and equally, if they don&#39;t work, it abandons them).
And this differentiates it from the competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which about a fifth are for software and another fifth for equipment.
Still, even in 1990, equipment accounted for more than half of the suppliers&#39; share.
As of 2000, IBM has sold underperforming assets for a total value of $ 15 billion. During the same period, it has invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first struck.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that until now the IBM company has managed to weather the crisis.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospheric up to 120%, the net profit of the company has not stopped increasing.
IBM&#39;s motto is to change everything except its value.
So it can be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will hold out.
IBM history: from cheese slicer to space flight
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York one hundred years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 - originally it was a brand used in the Canadian and South American branches.
The foundation that gave rise to the birth of IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous &quot;time clock&quot;, which allows controlling the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint hired the boss of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The new leader overshadowed the founder of IBM (Watson&#39;s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate identity and culture are built).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name implies, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business gadgets, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, the turnover doubled by 9 million dollars and the great expansion of the company began throughout the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after almost forty years in the boss&#39;s chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide the flights into space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System / 360 series.
The classic &quot;fish&quot;, which established the standard for computers of that time, hit the market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of the Pricewaterhouse Coopers company and began to offer comprehensive advice and high-value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for these last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, &quot;a smarter planet.&quot;
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned and the circumstances have not been improved, for example, in relation to transport and city administration.
For the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the &quot;Smart Commerce&quot; platform that enables retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 it opened a branch in the then Czechoslovakia, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Here today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-famous research team working with speech recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don&#39;t want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it&#39;s over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina still hoped that Josef would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
However, he is no longer going to wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
&quot;Pepe can go home, but not as my partner anymore,&quot; Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová welcomed Bartošové into her home for the summer, she couldn&#39;t imagine how their marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even declared publicly that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned herself, apparently accepting her husband&#39;s relationship and even saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychytář doesn&#39;t care who his wife is sleeping with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will kick him out. &quot;
&quot;But here I would live not as my dear old donkey who made a mistake, but as a man to whom I have certain ties,&quot; said Rychtářová, adding that she had already disengaged from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
So far Josef doesn&#39;t care that his woman has closed the back door on him.
&quot;I accept my wife&#39;s decision.&quot;
&quot;I will be with Iveta and there is no possible change.&quot;
&quot;My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect that.&quot;
&quot;The company is still in force, I do the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping.&quot;
&quot;Darina and I talk to each other normally, the only thing is that we do not share a bed, said Rychtář.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not object.
&quot;We don&#39;t sleep together and I&#39;m not interested in her, where she&#39;s going or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it&#39;s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility, &quot;concludes Josef.
The worst vices of women: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to name some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where certain feminine vices are mentioned that manage to make men&#39;s blood boil?
Go shopping
Do you blame your better half for being dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one washcloth a week?
Do you like to shop often at the sales?
So in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women find that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But let&#39;s see, what woman could resist the temptation to just stroll through the clothing stores, look for well-fitting clothes and then try them all in the changing room (ideally in all different colors)?
While shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it can practically become hell.
Just remember how many times you&#39;ve already told your partner to wait for you outside the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
&quot;Am I not too fat?&quot;
&quot;I would need to lose at least ten pounds - should I start exercising?&quot;
&quot;Did you really like it?&quot;
Do not these phrases sound familiar to you?
Yes?
So she is one of those women obsessed with her looks.
It&#39;s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain about their physical appearance all the time.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness first
It is like an infinite merry-go-round.
Cleaning the windows, vacuuming, scrubbing the floor, dusting, scrubbing the bathtub, and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on your clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for soiling a freshly cleaned sink and a hard-to-clean bookcase with glass doors?
In case you suffer from this &quot;deviation&quot;, try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness surely should not be paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make nasty comments
&quot;Used underpants are left with dirty clothes.&quot;
&quot;You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too&quot;
&quot;The wet cloth is not left on the floor!&quot;
If you make these comments to your partner more times a day, know that this will get him out of his mind.
Naturally. You don&#39;t want to say anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make as many comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women also go for slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, which is why they like to talk together about who, where, with whom, how, and why things together.
Maybe each of us sometimes misses a harmless little gossip.
With the hand on the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those who do not control themselves, who love to gossip and do it often, they despise everyone and are dangerous for those around them, especially in a female work team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr participated in the NHL game on Monday with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5: 3 at the Carolina field and put Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star&#39;s play, and went one step further and was declared player of the match.
He claimed two assists in the match and so did Jágr&#39;s teammate, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr told overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
&quot;Already before the game I had told him that he would make a triplet.&quot;
&quot;L knew&quot;.
&quot;Sometimes they look like ambushes,&quot; explained Jágr, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, in the wake of the Flyers&#39; first whiplash.
A while later, the second intervention of the team also had a Czech trace.
Voráček took the puck from behind the Hurricanes&#39; goal and moved it through the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was sent off, but from the beginning of the second half the Flyers already dominated.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr, he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through the fourth of Wayne Simmonds&#39; goal.
&quot;I love to play with him.&quot;
&quot;I do not want to say that he is the best player on the field, but without a doubt he is among the three best,&quot; Jágr pondered his central.
&quot;It would never have occurred to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him.&quot;
&quot;I am very satisfied with it.&quot;
&quot;I want to play for him.&quot;
All these years in the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results, &quot;adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and then again from Dwyer, from a penalty, until she was a goal away.
Matt Read allowed no further complications, although they were outnumbered two to one.
&quot;Pronger had a good performance in our field.&quot;
&quot;He cleared the disk, I picked up speed and Read went to the far side.&quot;
&quot;I tried to hit the puck and I&#39;m happy because I got it,&quot; Voráček described the last goal of the game as he lived it.
With their victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal&#39;s Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček did not play until late in the game against Buffalo, retiring in the second third with an upper body injury.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also by a difference of two goals, 2: 3.
Tomáš Plekanec failed to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach, he regretted the large number of injuries in the last row, and playing the game with only five defenders.
&quot;That&#39;s bad&quot;.
&quot;We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were new.&quot;
&quot;Anyway, but you can&#39;t do anything against that, we have to deal with it,&quot; said Jacques Martin.
&quot;So much rotating players turned against us, we couldn&#39;t resist it.&quot;
&quot;We had to simplify the game even more, get the puck out of our field.&quot;
&quot;And so we left holes,&quot; explained one of the defenders, PK Subban.
Goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty interventions for Winnipeg in a 5: 2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The Jets&#39; goals were scored by five players, ending a series of defeats that had already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia at that time: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of that time sold in most cases trips only to the socialist bloc, since travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on vacation to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and Hungary ( Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, afterwards the Yugoslav regime leaned west and Czech tourist travel was then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (that is, also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even in the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, if not, individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies in those days also offered trips to the West, but one had to stand in line with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night like that, or have &quot;good acquaintances&quot; in the agency.
Still all was not won.
The so-called &quot;promise of change&quot; that was the condition for travel to the West was not granted to &quot;politically unreliable people&quot;, who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs bought. This custom still persists.
The Czech way of traveling has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 it was the ultimate vacation in the GDR or Bulgaria for us, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware, the fact that the currently favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel freely, because it was part of the Yugoslavia at that time.
In the early 1990s, a visa waiver was imposed for travel to neighboring Western European states, causing a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not look fed up with excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris groups of Czechs slept in the parks in tents, since our income at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was to take food with them (preserves, sausages, etc.) to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living increased and with it average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increased demand for travel, agencies began, starting in 1997 regularly, to prepare trips using charter connections, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility to obtain discounts for the volume of passengers.
At the end of the 90s of the last century, Czechs were already traveling visa-free to almost all developed countries except the USA, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, thanks to a huge demand, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights depart every year with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries. This winter there will be direct flights from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, symbolizing our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 Czechs, for the first time in their history, spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, more than 15 thousand crowns were spent on trips abroad Czechs per head, including expenses on the site of stay.
Ordinary General Assembly called to elect the president, who could end up in a standstill again.
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that Ivan Hašek&#39;s successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday. in Nymburk.
In fact, an agreement has not yet been reached on the voting rules to follow.
Without them, it will not even be possible to vote to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned from his post in June but not before summoning his colleagues in order to find a strong person who would know how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the end of the Hašek era, a controversy broke out between the two federations of the association, unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This became evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní dům), located in the Smíchov neighborhood of Prague, because the talks had stalled and not only in terms of the method of election.
No consensus was reached as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or also delegates with full powers.
From that moment and due to this single point, a partial agreement was reached, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer shed even the Executive Committee, which, in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
Opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is this: how to proceed in the third round to avoid deadlock?
&quot;The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model,&quot; says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who, from the association&#39;s leadership, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round the candidate with the highest percentage of support in the federation to which they will present their candidacy will win.
The Moravian Region is ready to compromise so that the candidate with the highest total percentage of votes in both federations can win.
The bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
&quot;This would, however, take away the meaning of the two previous rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system&quot;, this is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to applicable statutes.
With what has been said, surprisingly, Tomaš Paclík also agrees, although it is assumed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all the candidates are more convenient for Pelta.
&quot;I would like to see the maximum vote in accordance with the statutes.&quot;
&quot;So that they don&#39;t make up any nonsense about the representatives like in the last General Assembly,&quot; says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and who directs her remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, in Nymburk it will be decided on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
&quot;All passions will be appeased with today&#39;s game of our national team at the European Championship.
&quot;Football will once again be the protagonist, and thus cooperate more comfortably&quot; affirms the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
&quot;I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated.&quot;
&quot;It is not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules for their own convenience.&quot;
&quot;This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly.&quot;
&quot;Still, I hope common sense will prevail,&quot; Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl had to travel to Podgorica, among others, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where it will take place. the qualifying match.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which, they say, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to bring the divided parties into the most powerful sports organization in the country so that an agreement can be reached.
The stakes are high: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of Sport (ČSTV) which will try to give Czech sport a new direction after the financial problems of the lottery house Sazka.
Paclík will fight for the presidency, because he cannot find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen footballers, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not stand as a candidate for such a relevant position.
&quot;If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and I would not run for election.&quot;
&quot;But until today such a person has not been found,&quot; Paclík told the Czech News Agency (ČTK).
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the position of president only until 2013, when it would be the turn of the ordinary general assembly.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too closely related to football events.
&quot;I&#39;ve already talked to a few people that I might consider.&quot;
&quot;For me it was crazy to hear some say that at the moment they don&#39;t even want to identify with Czech football.&quot;
&quot;I would like to change that vision,&quot; he adds.
What supposedly bothers Paclík the most at this point is Pelta&#39;s relationship with the President of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of the delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
&quot;In case he wins, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change.&quot;
&quot;With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will benefit even less,&quot; said Paclík.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta&#39;s name was associated with a wiretapping during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta got away with impunity.
&quot;I don&#39;t know what prestige to football Pelta&#39;s victory could bring.&quot;
&quot;And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us,&quot; said Paclík, also taking with some caution his earlier statement that &quot;he would sell out Club Pilsen if Pelta became president.&quot;
In the event of winning Thursday&#39;s election, Paclík could consider cooperating with Pelta in the future.
Of the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
&quot;He (Pelta) would be the first to follow.&quot;
&quot;He is very capable.&quot;
&quot;I could imagine him, for example, as head of the representation.&quot;
&quot;but not as a manager of an association.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t stick my nose where I don&#39;t feel capable either,&quot; added Paclík, who garnered a lot of attention in September for supporting the suspension of the Referees Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He uses his management skills in private companies, since since last summer he is also the Director of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated the victory in the first division in May.
&quot;I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to its safe practice.&quot;
&quot;To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, said Paclík without hiding his antipathies towards the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it lobbied political leaders to allocate more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
&quot;It is one of the key problems that the new president should address.&quot;
&quot;If they raised taxes on gambling, as the political parties advertise, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going,&quot; he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR must be &quot;non-partisan&quot;.
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
&quot;It is not ideal.&quot;
&quot;But I don&#39;t see the point in hypocritically handing over my shares in the Pilsen Club to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half,&quot; Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end the stalemate in the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would guarantee that the FAČR would have new statutes that would definitely serve to solve, in the future, controversies regarding the electoral regulations.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about Thursday&#39;s meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the soccer team.
Already before the missed elections in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this postponement of two months could go well for him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on the management of football.
&quot;People of all levels have been involved in football for a long time and are looking forward to meeting the new President this Thursday.&quot;
&quot;They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association,&quot; thinks the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and on the Association&#39;s executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
&quot;Unfortunately, in the June General Assembly the statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought.&quot;
&quot;If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September,&quot; warned Pelta.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a decoy to win over the delegates.
&quot;If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am ready to respond should this fail.&quot;
&quot;It is a question of principles, without which we cannot exist,&quot; says Pelta.
Also, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he saw himself collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in Law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
He had not attacked Thomas Paclík for a long time, who, unlike Pelta, left no puppet with a head.
&quot;He has been in the soccer world for more than a year, and has already had some successes.&quot;
&quot;His attacks but they were shameful and many people were surprised by the electoral campaign.&quot;
&quot;That is why many of them doubt their true character,&quot; he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced already in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the highest competitions.
The latter should be a showcase for promoting football.
&quot;It would also try to fix all the scandals that arose over the Bohemians as a result of last year&#39;s corruption scandal.&quot;
&quot;Immediately afterwards I would get involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football,&quot; the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal changes to the squad.
&quot;You would have to know the tasks of each employee first,&quot; he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are predicted before the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain to Nymburk this Thursday.
&quot;If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, we will certainly get past it.
&quot;Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader&quot;, still two days before the most decisive day in his career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FAČR would start working eagerly.
If the current vice president Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, if elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement systematic change and hold executive committee members accountable for each area of soccer individually.
He is also committed to solving the Bohemians case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, raising more money for football and continuing the work started by former president Ivan Hašek.
&quot;As president, I would like to dedicate myself completely to soccer.&quot;
&quot;From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, through professional football or the training of high-performance young footballers.&quot;
&quot;By this I don&#39;t mean that I would do it all alone,&quot; Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
&quot;I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee in such a way that each member can dedicate himself to a specific area.&quot;
&quot;And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum.&quot;
&quot;A lot of people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others,&quot; he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he is said to have considered the possibility of not running again as a candidate.
&quot;Everyone knows that I work 20 hours a day.&quot;
&quot;But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will impede and hinder me at every step,&quot; he explained the reasons for his indecision.
&quot;Many people have told me that I must not give up, because then others would give up as well.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s about having faith not to just give up like that,&quot; he said.
He is also said to be motivated by continuing the work that he already started with Hašek.
&quot;During those two years, a lot of the work was finished that I don&#39;t want to be lost now.&quot;
&quot;There are processes that had been started and that will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them,&quot; he announced worried about the fact that, if they elected the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association it could go back to the way it was before Hašek&#39;s time.
&quot;I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
&quot;Behind him are above all all those people who would take care of football so that it was only a privilege for a select few.&quot;
&quot;You can blame me for a lot of things, but not the fact that I am for someone.&quot;
&quot;I try to be objective.&quot;
&quot;I want to make football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel good and not just the chosen ones,&quot; Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
&quot;Although some people try to claim otherwise, I have in mind to do my best for Moravia.&quot;
&quot;For example, it is time to think about dividing the second division into a Czech part and a Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first division.&quot;
&quot;There would be no current situation where we have only three Moravian teams, which represents a problem for young Moravian players,&quot; Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential election, Rajchl does not stop believing in his chances of being elected.
&quot;I still feel that I have strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and knows that behind me there are clear successes,&quot; said Rajchl, whose successes include saving a few tens of millions of crowns from disadvantageous contracts, television contract negotiations and lottery law negotiations.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his share of the blame that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is &quot;disqualified from regaining confidence in Czech football&quot;, he regards the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
&quot;No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year.&quot;
&quot;In the event that he is elected, he will probably continue what Ivan Hašek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing of the committees.&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t want to use that to my advantage,&quot; Rajchl assesses his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to the blue
by Julia Stanek
Pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Whoever visits Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something she couldn&#39;t miss in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she gazed at the artistic dome overhead, swam to the marble angels that awaited her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, taking note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book &quot;Badefreuden&quot;: the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, the &quot;concrete constructions&quot; in Taunus.
He made his &quot;trip through the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe&quot; through 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true fan of bathroom culture.
It doesn&#39;t want to have anything to do with sport, says Meder, only the water is different.
It only bothers him that bathroom fans have to settle for blue tiles and the stench of chlorine, while joggers can breathe in the mesmerizing smell of spruce forests or hear the joyous chirps of birds in the park.
&quot;One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,&quot; says this Vienna resident.
&quot;I started collecting nice pools.&quot;
The surface of the water duplicates the architecture.
The splash in the pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The wellness factor in pools is so great because all the senses are catered for, according to Meder.
And if the builder makes the effort, indoor pools can be a real feast for the eyes: &quot;Instead of ground, the bathrooms have a surface of water.&quot;
&quot;On the one hand it is transparent, on the other it reflects the beauty of the entire building.&quot;
Everything is optically doubled: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The small-format photo book &quot;Badefreuden&quot; provides on 190 pages very interesting facts about the architecture and art history in the historical oases of well-being, but, mainly, it makes you want to jump into the blue.
Meder, the swimming pool collector, discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, there are waters with nitrates in a unique karst cavity (cavity baths in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some thermal baths, whose pools are of alkaline waters and they are in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: As the whole city casts its eyes on Zurich&#39;s indoor pool, you can gaze out at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can watch the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design awaits customers in Längenfeld: Ötztal&#39;s Water Cathedral looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
Steam rises from three open springs in winter, while the Ötztal Mountains rise into the sky in the background.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, didn&#39;t get the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the stench of diesel is so strong that people believe they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose silt sticks to the skin when entering the pool, an enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for beautiful bathing spots, when she wanted to visit outdoor pools and sun baths in the Luhatschowitz Czech bath, she came across a blocked ground.
Architect Duan Jurkovic&#39;s 1902 bathroom was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white, and yellow modernist building, he saw weeds grow between the tiles.
The decadence countered in a charming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three construction phases behind them; Not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements from the time of its construction in 1844, but also an Alhambra-style Arab hall, added in 1900.
Since its painstaking modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is a native of the Black Forest.
&quot;It takes a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,&quot; says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not have much importance.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the commodities business
By Christian Teevs
Deutsche Bank giving up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to verify the consequences of speculation for the world&#39;s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of those surveyed claim that Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions will withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world&#39;s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges drives up prices, and banks bear the responsibility for the global problem of hunger.
The consumer ombudsman campaign is specifically directed at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, betting on commodities was intended to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have decoupled from supply and demand, profiting from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently than US competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business &quot;deserves to compromise the good name of Deutsche Bank.&quot;
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims in the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be finalized by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank management, along with a recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank&#39;s management will report the consequences.
In the end there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: &quot;Bets on rising food prices show especially drastically how ruthless banks are currently hurting the public welfare.&quot;
Ackermann ranks as the biggest bank lobbyist, especially on bonds.
&quot;Deutsche Bank should write off all investments in its portfolio where it puts money for food price gambling at stake,&quot; said Bode.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if Ackermann is about people starving or the fame of Deutsche Bank.&quot;
Ackermann&#39;s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to give a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different than the unplanned in the board of directors.
By abandoning controversial land speculation, you can improve your image.
And you need to care little about potential losses, that is what your successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel out investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization&#39;s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode released the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Just 10 percent believed it was legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on food prices.
Many clients of the bank showed personal consequences when discovering that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments that make money from agricultural speculation.
43 percent would advise against such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent would request, after reflection, to cancel their account and would change to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The pavilion moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups and downs and a happy ending, the 1958 Brussels Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, was left empty and fell apart.
Now it reopens as an exhibition house.
The modern postgerra architecture is passionate, the clear forms, the glass halls, the bold curves and the new construction materials, typical of the thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels of 1958 is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix for Architecture for its light, floating steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to date a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary building for exhibitions, was erected after the universal exhibition in the Schweizer Garten next to the Vienna South Station, was renovated in 1962 and inside a museum of the 20th century was inaugurated, it was called the &quot;20th house &quot;.
The building was adequate but lacked adequate space and technology for a museum; no wall to hang art, no good atmosphere.
Despite this it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is increasingly decaying.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz renovated the pavilion, now calling it &quot;house 21&quot; and it will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, was inaugurated with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery since 2007, made a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, an ice figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby&#39;s, the Guggenheim museum, and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the renovations with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and an office building should also be built.
Tight control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he sensitively reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded it and was awarded the competition, but also because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an &quot;important and immense place&quot;, in which he contemplated &quot;almost every weekend&quot; the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in his change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current renovations there are big problems, the building was &quot;a drain on energy&quot;, said Krischanitz.
The profile of the windows of the glass façade was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
The thermal bridges and steel girders were reinforced or replaced and the asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were employed for the new use, a light panel lowered between the house and the street provides the illumination, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in antique mahogany tones and protected against rust.
And the movie theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monuments office and a low budget.
&quot;Often I had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked by the monument protection office,&quot; says Krischanitz, noting a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems, and renovations, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The pavilion &quot;that came from Brussels&quot; has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical &quot;chance appearance in the history of the city.&quot;
Such an architecture is &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and that is why he wanted to &quot;awaken the right conscience.&quot;
In this case, house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been an urban windfall. The totally new and planned &quot;Central Station Quarter&quot;, with homes and offices, is adjacent to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck will happen: House 21 could receive a reinforcement from another Krischanitz construction, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as it sounds, is negotiating with the city about a neighboring place at the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans winter crisis package amounting to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train breakdowns in winter.
The number of personnel must be doubled.
What costs millions.
In the fight against train breakdowns and delays caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper &quot;Bild&quot; reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, of the planned investments until 2005 of a total of around 300 million euros.
For which a better availability of vehicles and the railway network must be achieved even with extreme weather.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees to 16,000 positions to remove snow from the tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of breakdowns and delays in the trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and the industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, it lacked reservations due to adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for authorization from the federal rail office.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered a broken axle at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in penalties in the US.
After the uproar over President Josef Ackerman, a new US problem appears, Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems weren&#39;t enough for Deutche Bank, its US past acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a deal, to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage securities.
Financial markets regulator NCUA reproaches many large banks for inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks to the depths.
&quot;We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court,&quot; said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not admit any fault with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $ 20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for credit unions in the US and provides bankruptcy support to protect clients&#39; investments.
The NCUA tries to reimburse the losses of millions originated.
The currently closed deals are your first type.
The regulator had also held other large banks to account and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of doubtful mortgage securities, they are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, it ruined many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, a difficult wind is currently blowing for US banks.
Investors and the inspection have initiated countless processes to receive compensation or sanction misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the most lawsuits.
He reproaches the 18 large international banks for the fact that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also has a claim from the FHFA, it deals with businesses worth 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to answer for &quot;substantial losses&quot;, without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
Finance guru Buffett invests heavily in Information Technology company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than $ 10 billion.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in computer companies or Information Technologies since the forecasts of the long-term development of the companies are negative.
But you have read IBM&#39;s business report and changed your mind about investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before that IBM mainly offers services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, a Warren Buffett investment is considered an honor.
Therefore, the IT primitive should be called &quot;Sir IBM&quot;.
Buffett currently revealed on economics broadcaster CNBC that he has acquired $ 10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has thereby promoted one of IBM&#39;s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM has not heard of the engagement so far.
He praised the management that dealt with ordinary profits in the economic crisis.
&quot;They have done a great job,&quot; Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has established lucrative Information Technology services such as data center operations for some time.
The 100+ year old IT pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett avoided tech companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
Instead, Buffett seized the opportunity on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer, or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 of its own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That is why he is an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and unerring money-making sense has earned him the nickname &quot;Oracle of Omaha.&quot;
After discovering Buffett&#39;s investment, IBM&#39;s shares on the stock market rose 1 percent.
&quot;The Blue Giant,&quot; as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than $ 220 billion and ranks, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world&#39;s most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn&#39;t want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is made concrete
Following the discovery of &quot;the Zwickau cell&quot;, the Turkish media doubts the German rule of law.
One newspaper speaks of a &quot;bloody ideology&quot; that is rekindled.
The murders of eight small Greek and stunt entrepreneurs between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right undertone.
Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was believed to have been dead for a long time returns, since the attacks in the form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of violence with a far-right undertone against Turks.
However, the existence of xenophobia in Germany has never been questioned.
The ultra-rightist network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were far from predictable.
&quot;Bloody ideology revived again?&quot; Headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper &quot;Haberturk.&quot;
On the contrary, the newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot; emphasizes that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant for the Federal Office for the Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, over the weekend remembering the victims of racist violence with a vigil outside the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected at a solemn act of the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information reached some Turkish media like a slap in the face: &quot;The German gift for the 50th anniversary&quot;, reads the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform &quot;Haber X&quot;, referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcast &quot;Hürriyet&quot; does not insist on tracing this mental connection either.
&quot;It starts to smell bad,&quot; reads the headline of Ahmet Külahci&#39;s column.
It highlights that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
On the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished that the German authorities have not searched the far-right circle for suspects long before.
Some are at least rhetorical in terms of the drastic media: &quot;From now on here you lose, the immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and weapons.&quot;
&quot;This will be the best self-protection.&quot;
&quot;The internal peace of Germany depends strongly on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network&quot;., Writes &quot;Selen&quot;.
Which means that if Germany&#39;s internal peace is in danger, the Mölln and Solingen attacks will be cleared up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memoirs.
No other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen group sentiment on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press then mainly criticized the deficiency of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire attack he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Foreign Minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks of Germany contribute to taxes.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of their taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media shows once again how profound the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country has been since then.
In addition to the effort of a comprehensive explanation and a reassessment of far-right terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The bank of the Lake Zurich scandal
The riskiest bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it is run by a German.
Surely Axel Weber hadn&#39;t thought about it.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the federal bank, in July it was known that in 2013 he would start a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of directors of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoices, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound strength, and drops kind remarks on his future colleagues.
&quot;USB has achieved a revitalization.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m happy to be collaborating with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.&quot;
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A USB financial operator in London bypassed all the bank&#39;s security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, CEO of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to attend.
The president of the administrative council of the USB was considered since then equally touched, and all asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber must advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board of directors in May, not in early 2013, as the bank reported Tuesday.
This is tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, an economics professor and counselor and he has had a period of adaptation that is surely necessary.
Suddenly he is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it deserves the title &quot;the biggest bank in the scandal in Europe&quot; for some time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the world&#39;s largest asset manager, and on the other, for years it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss asset manager, but also crafty, was combined with ambitious goals, he also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
For one thing, at $ 1.6 trillion, USB handles more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world&#39;s great banks.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking in Zurich for many years explains: &quot;To my students, I have always described USB as a model of a good bank.&quot;
&quot;From today&#39;s point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?&quot;
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong with the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, surprisingly resigned.
Some months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank&#39;s mutual fund had a loss on high-risk securities and had to write off billions.
To carry this, USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course some would look down on until recently: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet that its name had never been heard.
This was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second highest paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its wrong investments, UBS found itself in financial crisis due to bankruptcy and had to be bailed out by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatorily convertible bond, through which it became a co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was claimed how dramatic this was for a small country, if it is home to such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the balance of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic results of Switzerland (see graph).
&quot;We cannot rescue UBS again,&quot; said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy clients, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, the UBS more or less confessed to having helped in the tax fraud.
Simultaneously, he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for wealthy clients: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the administrative council.
And the exodus of customer funds.
In this way, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two core sectors: in investment banking through erroneous speculations and in asset management through aiding tax fraud.
And just when it was a little calmer again, just when it was thought that UBS would get it again, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, this still does not work well with risk management in investment banking.
&quot;The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little,&quot; says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich Banking Institute.
The CFO of a large German bank is also sure: &quot;The problem with UBS is that it does not master risk controls.&quot;
So the idea of caution arose, with which Swiss bankers have long presented themselves, to be the guardians of the greatest assets in the world: no risk too great, instead, the security of money wants to fail on the other side of the alpine republic.
Swiss bank security deposits were the symbol of unwavering reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli for real chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich does not fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it is only slightly older.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich&#39;s Bahnhofstraße, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are ostentatious, the rents are some of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelers such as Tiffany`s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have resided here for years: from the national bank, through the Credit Suisse palace, to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
You enter the UBS reception room through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are lined with marble, in front are large leather chairs, next to the bank&#39;s logo there is a large sign to indicate &quot;security&quot;.
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
The UBS has become too big, he believes, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing more to say.
&quot;And they have long gotten used to the ways of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot;
In fact, UBS changed Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then came disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the jungle of high risk as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
&quot;That Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation&quot;, writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;Der UBS-Crash&quot; (&quot;The crash of the UBS&quot; in Spanish ).
Politicians gave up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do they come up for that?
You talk to the Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three big Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too big for little Switzerland, and it continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different predecessor banks of the UBS: a rich but sleepy bank with the center of asset management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a big financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative council.
&quot;I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,&quot; says banking expert Hans Geiger.
&quot;Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to work his way from learning on the bench to the top.&quot;
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: &quot;He thought his models were a reality,&quot; says Geiger.
&quot;It is a tragic case.&quot;
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: The folly came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember management meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Take Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They topped the &quot;League Tables,&quot; the rankings that then documented the success of banks.
UBS wanted to be at the top.
Some steps worked out for him.
In currency trading and stock trading it was at the top.
However, the company advisers in charge highlighted a weak point: In the international interest business, in the language of &quot;fixed income&quot; banking, there is a huge indemnity for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Eager for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its hedge funds created in American high risk investments.
It became a powerful machine to securitize American mortgage loans and then sell them, keeping certain risks at their own expense.
And also, like other banks, it looked for the descent for a long time.
&quot;In the summer of 2007, as the American housing market was on fire, UBS bought there,&quot; said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave as the ordering attempt proved more difficult than they expected.
The positions at UBS were converted into projection seats and are unsafe to this day.
Currently, who runs a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, to which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a banking expert, has an idea, put an end to investment banking, focus on property management, go back to Swiss real estate.
The bank doesn&#39;t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking must decline a lot, it is clear today.
The following Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank surprisingly parted ways with its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he prevailed: He must permanently direct the business of UBS, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
It suppresses 3,500 positions.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to earn money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is surely asking himself today.
So far he only says that he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
The fear of the recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The looming recession in Europe has scared American investors at the beginning of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remain without force.
Slowed industrial production on the continent stifles hopes of stabilizing a debt crisis at its source.
General relief on changes of government in Rome and Athens might not be imposed.
The euro fell against the dollar.
In the past week, the Italian and Greek glass has looked half full, not half empty, but now the issues are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are listed on the sales list.
The Dow Jones index of standard stocks closed 0.6 percent lower at 12,078 points.
In the session, the market barometer oscillates between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The S&amp;P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq index of the technology exchange lost 0.8 percent and left the market with 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax index says goodbye with a decline of 1.2 percent to 5,985 points.
The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is positioned at the end of its boom.
Companies produced two percent less in September than the previous month, as reported by Eurostat&#39;s statistical office.
Which created skepticism among US investors: &quot;We are not an island, but dependents,&quot; said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot break free from a recession so quickly, and there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do whatever it takes to end the crisis, he claimed in an interview for CNBC.
That is why, from his point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, throw away a decade of old principles and enter the American tech industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the price of the shares of the traditional consortium and makes it trade against the trend in the market at the beginning just a percentage higher.
The stock closed almost unchanged at $ 187.35.
Following a few prompts, Buffett paid $ 170 on average for each unit and kept 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway fell 1.3 percent.
Bank of American equity securities clearly strengthened at 2.6 percent higher than the market.
The house sells most of the rest of its shares to China Construction Bank and rakes in $ 6.6 billion for it.
The institute mainly wants to reinforce its share of capital with the net profit of the business and thereby comply with regulatory requirements.
Aircraft builder Boeing increased its profits and thereby limited losses at Dow.
The stock rose 1.5 percent after the consortium claimed the largest order in its history.
Emirates Airline ordered 50 long-haul aircraft of the type 777 on Friday and the order value was estimated at 18 billion dollars.
Including the options of 20 more machines, the volume amounts to 26 billion dollars.

719 values increased, 2,281 decreased and 79 remained unchanged.
The Nasdaq closed with sales volumes of 1.38 billion, 630 shares up, 1,913 down and 82 unchanged.
Smart rooks spread out in cities
In many places, rooks are considered &quot;problem birds&quot; - these highly intelligent animals are not driven out of cities for long, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the rooks have been in the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors accumulate about the filth and the noise of the animals.
Although no media against &quot;problem birds&quot; has appeared so far.
Rooks no longer leave cities, experts say at the first rook symposium in Leer, East Frisia.
There specialists from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
They look for alternatives in the cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of the cities to the migration of certain protected rooks from the countryside; chemical applications in agriculture visibly destroy traditional living spaces.
Hunting, growing buildings and falling trees that host them make life difficult for birds.
The rooks are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005, a controversial project to kill the district&#39;s rooks en masse made the headlines in the press.
Critics have called hunting the animals using bird traps and killing with sticks especially brutal.
&quot;Driving them out and driving them away in the normal way does nothing,&quot; said Werner Klöver, urban planner and landscaper from Leer.
Shooting nests with water or throwing trees are often unintended consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
&quot;Animals wander off, large colonies divide and distribute them elsewhere.&quot;
Driving them away is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
&quot;We must live with them, we no longer catch them.&quot;
Without the surroundings, the problem in cities is not solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of Leer.
A combination of driving animals out of sensitive residential areas and baiting them to re-settle elsewhere is possible.
&quot;Information panels instead of chain saws&quot; Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against the aim that animals are treated in a totally different way: &quot;The best thing is that we can take a spike in the face with aplomb.&quot;
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger Rook Teaching Circuit in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs report on the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on criticism for the noise of birds: &quot;They are all forms of communication, they have a lot to say.&quot;
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the rooks not only take advantage of the resources to access schist bites, but also make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists from the University of Cambridge verified in four rooks how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned to drop a stone onto a platform in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to land on the platform.
In a second trial, the cunning rooks had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beaks.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the handle of the tube.
Three of the four rooks made it on the first try.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope for the championship.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the last tickets for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after 0-0 in the first leg, made all five Euro Cup appearances in a row.
The Czechs managed 1-0 (0-0) in the second leg of the play-offs with outsider Montenegro, after they made things clear in the first leg (2-0).
Croatia did not let them score 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland were weak 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga pro Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) closed the gap twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the 2010 World Cup play-offs in South Africa.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal got off to a perfect start.
Ronaldo took a direct free from more than 30 meters to take the lead in the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her skills to score from afar and made it 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not shine in the first half hour, had their first clear opportunity thanks to striker Edin Dzeko.
The former player of the Wolfsburg team, the English leader Manchester City, sent a header to the post, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek got it right for the Czech Republic
Then collegiate Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark whistled a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic transformed.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champion cleared everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs put an end to the last doubt in the 81st minute with a goal from Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion qualifies for the fifth time in a row for the European Championship.
Coach Michal Bilek&#39;s team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a second of reaction in the opening phase.
At the last minute, goalkeeper Petr Cech reflexively avoided a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the return of the front, very right in the goal of Cech.
After the break, the Czechs had to protect the crossbar from the world-famous goalkeeper, the FC Seoul striker escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey wasted the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not go from 0-0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink was almost certain to leave his seat on the 2002 World Cup third-party bench, the Croats celebrated their fourth appearance in the Euro Cup final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got off to a dream start.
In the seventh minute and with a long-range kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post. Striker Kazim Kazim was also unable to send the ball into the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia did not let a goal be scored.
Along with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made room for Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are Bundesliga legionnaires in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Eurocup
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate the first European Championship appearance since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni&#39;s team, who triumphed 4-0 in the first leg set for a preliminary decision, took the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the invited team.
Ireland pressed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big chance.
From the first moment, the Estonian defense avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32nd minute, he overtook it.
After a defense from goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, making it 1-0.

Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund&#39;s intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate Story about World War I, &quot;begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make a your soul falls to your feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently tear off this page and make it your brand pages.
You will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund&#39;s novel narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of your men and women, you are confused and helpless in the fog. from the war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish journalist and historian.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he aptly describes as &quot;a work of anti-history.&quot;
It contains some notable names, important treatises, or famous battles; there are practically no ambassadors, elegant journalists, or discussions of tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as &quot;a book about how it happened.&quot; It is about &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods.&quot;
&quot;The Beauty and Pain of Battle&quot; combines the wartime experiences of 20 or so ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and clerks.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their limbs, go mad, or die.
Their lives flicker here like votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mix while others are turned off.
Mr. Englund&#39;s book is a departure from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the fatal trench warfare on the Western Front.
&quot;The Beauty and Pain of Battle&quot; expertly moves through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are struck by hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War floods these people&#39;s lives like a natural catastrophe, Hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordite.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman at home with your children, do you stay or run away?
Who&#39;s coming anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening, not even why this war has to be fought.
&quot;Lack of fact,&quot; Mr. Englund observes, &quot;has been filled with guesswork, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.&quot;
&quot;The Beauty and Pain of Battle&quot; follows such individuals as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the high seas fleet.
Their stories have been obtained for the most part from memoirs, letters, and other previously published material.
The explanations of their lives can be terrifying or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, missing details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivation and coping with what&#39;s out there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl he says: &quot;Substitutes, everywhere substitutes.&quot;
&quot;Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons.&quot;
He goes on to talk about ersatz food in Germany.
It describes &quot;meat made from rice cooked and pressed in mutton fat (and topped with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and dried potato peelings; shoes with wooden soles.&quot;
There are, he notes, &quot;837 permitted meat substitutes in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes.&quot;
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive for savagery and says about the war: &quot;You feel that, after all, this is what men are meant to do and not to sit in armchairs with a cigar and a whiskey, the newspaper of the late or a best seller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starched and studded breastplate. &quot;
Instead a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will find out or care.
&quot;Once one resigns oneself to the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think what could happen in front of the public,&quot; he writes.
Instead, he is horribly like &quot;a condemned man being secretly strangled.&quot;
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new kinds of terror.
&quot;The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,&quot; writes Mr. Englund, &quot;a war between factories.&quot;
It reflects the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species in the bestiary of the young century: The eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in well-made clothes who executes his carnage while sitting behind a desk.&quot;
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both ignoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund speaks of soldiers who actively tried to catch venereal disease from prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front.
&quot;The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and smear their genitals with it in the hope of ending up in hospital,&quot; he writes.
&quot;Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often results in lifelong blindness.&quot;
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund&#39;s lithe but not flamboyant prose is perfectly suited to his human endeavor.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way in which the war has &quot;unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.&quot;
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as Paul Fussell&#39;s The Great War and Modern Memory, or novels such as Erich María Remarque&#39;s Quiet Front, rather than full-length stories.
Mr. Englund&#39;s volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I will not reveal it.
But it is as if he had come from his book, ripped that page of dramatis personae from between your fingers, and had burned it with a match.
After a previous misstep, a planned assault to the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
Monday through Tuesday night was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be emptier.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence underscoring how the operation was fraught with challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks, such as pepper spray being sprayed on protesters, breaking department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for the &quot;squatters&quot; could not be repeated.
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared by seeing how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking towards Zuccotti.
Officers stepped up so-called riot training - counterterrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing large numbers of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park came at the &quot;last minute,&quot; said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as &quot;an exercise.&quot;
&quot;The few cops I know who were called for this, they weren&#39;t told it was to get into Zuccotti Park,&quot; said the person, who spoke anonymously.
&quot;The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department.&quot;
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday&#39;s operation involved agents from various police units, including special forces from across the municipal district - dozens of mobile agents who routinely flooded high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, such as those who commute to work, had been going to and from the park during the day, making 1 am a good time to get in.
&quot;It was appropriate to do it when there were the fewest number of people in the park,&quot; he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with spotlights and loudspeakers congregated at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before exiting.
The lights and prerecorded messages booming from the loudspeakers appeared to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs officers went to the park in their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply packed up their things and left.
No stores were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave it.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said that an attempt was made to prevent them from seeing the police go into action in the park, and that they had been roughly treated by officers.
Mr. Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the dense tangle of protesters&#39; personal effects, including luggage and paper and plastic garbage bags crammed with clothing, teams from the Cleaning Department followed, picking up what was left. left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged outside, images surfacing on the internet shortly afterwards.
A central group of protesters took up positions near the camp&#39;s kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police entered to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp locked arms with each other.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said that about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for &quot;disorderly conduct and resistance to authority,&quot; he said.
The highest ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the uniformed senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department&#39;s chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, &quot;was not directing operations,&quot; Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, and on Pine Street, one block south.
From those positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a series of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
At around 5 am, south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen blowing air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out from the crowd.
In the end, an officer and a protester were hospitalized.
Support workers union to sue city over layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, District 37, in its effort to overturn the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the lowest paid in the city lost their jobs on October 7, in a move union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal to allowing, last spring, access by the city to a health care fund run by task forces to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Hall hearing last month, Education Councilor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget approved in June.
A council member countered by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that members of the school&#39;s support staff would be fired.
Officials from City District 37 said they put the claim in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued. A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the city Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all of whom are black or Latino women, as well as most of the attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city&#39;s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more attendees as that had been chronically under-subsidized.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, &quot;This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds. to cover the budget deficit. &quot;
PS District 36&#39;s budget was cut 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each poor student enrollment in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by the language in a memorandum authorizing the firing of parent coordinators.
The memo used the word &quot;surplus&quot; to describe the action, although &quot;surplus&quot; most often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school&#39;s payroll to a job board, whose salaries are paid by the office. central.
&quot;Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,&quot; says the draft complaint, &quot;and not just in excess.&quot;
Mission over, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are ready to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and assassinated, and America&#39;s involvement at an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat of Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican of Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent of Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the US troops for their &quot;courage&quot;.
&quot;This resolution is to honor the brave of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country,&quot; Kerry said.
&quot;It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.&quot;
The language may sound harmless, but nothing about the Libya debate has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties squabbled with each other and with the White House over the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in NATO&#39;s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and it was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for US operations in Libya.
That left the US mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress angry enough to criticize Obama&#39;s handling of the mission, but not angry enough to actually mow the grass underfoot.
Then the hesitancy of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell to the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was assassinated on October 20.
NATO&#39;s mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee resolution &quot;congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resilience to liberate themselves&quot; and &quot;commends the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism. &quot;
The resolution also &quot;declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&quot;
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs committee, or will it divide lawmakers like the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee&#39;s top Republican.
Lugar&#39;s spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
Across the Capitol, the House is voting this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves an entire assembly vote in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far been unsuccessful in getting their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of trying.
Goodlatte&#39;s is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicates - the same bill is being proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations from one another.
There are at least 15 versions of the Balanced Budget Amendment in the House alone, and another handful that will &quot;control federal spending.&quot;
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their backers - especially rookie Republicans looking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to brag that they were the &quot;authors&quot; of the measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can serve, while Representative José E. Serrano (D-New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and healthcare, among other issues.
An amendment banning gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as is one banning the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be overturned if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
As enthusiastic as members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 modifications, and presented 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly tabled more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren&#39;t much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
&quot;Beaten but not defeated,&quot; Giffords speaks in her first TV interview since the shooting.
Ten months after she was shot point-blank by a gunman at a constituent rally in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night, singing to the Broadway tune &quot;The Sun Will Rise Tomorrow.&quot; and he said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to go back to Congress.
In her appearance on ABC News &quot;20/20&quot; with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show documented his difficult journey back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and punctured the left side of his brain, from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he came back to the House by surprise to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling deal.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing his recovery as &quot;difficult.&quot;
When asked by Sawyer how he&#39;s feeling, the 41-year-old Giffords replied, &quot;Pretty good.&quot;
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long &quot;20/20&quot; special that aired on the eve of the publication of the couple&#39;s new book, &quot;Gabby: A story of courage and hope &quot;.
The special program looked at Giffords&#39; recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, her head shaved and a long scar across her forehead.
She can only keep a finger or two upright, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
A shake of the head.
A puckering of the lips.
And then his first word: &quot;What.&quot;
Within days, Giffords uttered another word - &quot;toast,&quot; a request for a change to his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: The congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; by Cyndi Lauper and &quot;Free Falling&quot; by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he does not remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading a newspaper article to Giffords about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
&quot;A lot of people died,&quot; Giffords told Sawyer.
&quot;Hard, hard, hard.&quot;
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife&#39;s recovery, she said, &quot;I&#39;ve been defeated.&quot;
&quot;So, I said,&quot; &#39;Gabby, you haven&#39;t been defeated,&#39; &quot;Kelly said.
&quot;You&#39;ve just been hit.
And you&#39;re going to come out of this, and you&#39;re going to recover and you&#39;re going to come back stronger than ever. &quot;
The troops make me feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration, and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines stormed their posts around him.
The etiquette crowd stood up and applauded.
&quot;Men and women were regarded as heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
&quot;They were shown as some kind of orphan child,&quot; the officer wrote in an email.
I&#39;m sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn&#39;t respect, really. It was a pity.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has gripped the military and an often distant, sometimes adoring American public.
The troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, service members say.
The public increasingly acts as if they are sorry for those in uniform.
&quot;We are not victims at all,&quot; said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
&quot;But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put ourselves in the role of helpless souls.&quot;
The issue is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity take place quietly and privately among veterans.
After their two sons returned from fighting with the Marine Corps, retired Col. Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would view their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there was an &quot;angry and violent veteran below the surface,&quot; said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked if he would be able to endure under the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
&quot;When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,&quot; Cancian recalled telling her children.
Military unrest arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
&quot;We as a nation no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II,&quot; said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, accolades from politicians and the public focus largely on the depth of a service member&#39;s suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military faces mounting pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity in the face of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
Private Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was on his way back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he came across a colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer cans.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
&quot;An alarm signal sounded,&quot; says Lyman.
However, the Texas native put her concern aside.
I thought, no, he&#39;s 19.
&quot;He&#39;s from Texas,&quot; he says.
&quot;I wish I had listened to my instincts.&quot;
Within minutes of entering Lyman&#39;s room, the man approached her from behind, pulling her down and raping her, she alleges.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision in a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether their lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, DC attorney, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or dispense adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says he&#39;s going for the Army staff, because the problem starts with them.
&quot;The military is a top-down structure,&quot; he says.
&quot;Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The high command.&quot;
Burke also says that since February, she has been contacted by about 400 more survivors, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of piling up all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, he&#39;s going to file multiple cases, if necessary, to keep up the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by US Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
Court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy - in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the military.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damages suffered by active duty personnel.
&quot;The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs&#39; military service,&quot; the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment for this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars are rarely clear on front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It&#39;s time for the military to modernize too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her fight, and three other lawsuits are underway in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
Separately, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on diagnoses of &quot;personality disorder&quot; assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service - a common occurrence, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims for benefits for people who say they have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010 there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
However, the attacks are notably underreported, and by the Pentagon&#39;s own estimates, which figure at approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, released in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of reported cases in the military went to trial - half that in the civilian justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke&#39;s case describe his attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman&#39;s case, he reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to share the details of his rape 11 different times to a crowd of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She was subjected to a rape kit, and her assailant&#39;s blood - from a cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which she was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as personal witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
&quot;I remember the day the verdict was read,&quot; says Lyman.
&quot;I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself yelling from the living room.&quot;
&quot;They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I came out, I remember saying to my commanding officer,&quot; That was not his judgment. That was my judgment. &quot;
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for duty.
In January 2010 she was released from service on less-than-honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
As for whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow suitors continues, it&#39;s a long shot, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington School of Law.
However, he notes, &quot;In my opinion, they should be able to move on.&quot;
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrent that responsibility poses.
He adds: &quot;The odds are strongly against them ... but it is important for them to try.&quot;
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn&#39;t go your way, Burke, the plaintiffs&#39; attorney, will queue up her other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
&quot;We are going to continue fighting the army on this issue until the reform takes place,&quot; he says.
&quot;Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy airing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a massacre in Norway in July that left 77 people dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time preceding his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups online. social.
After this summer&#39;s tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - just log into Facebook.
&quot;We realized that it was not that difficult to reach them,&quot; says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by UK think tank DEMOS.
Facebook&#39;s stash of personal information is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographics with scientific precision - the way marketers have been using it for years.
Bartlett&#39;s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then ran ads to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey more than 10,000 followers of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
&quot;It&#39;s a totally new way of doing research,&quot; says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male, and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, &quot;those who combine their activism online with activism offline are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.&quot;
DEMOS&#39;s work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends as expressed in &quot;likes&quot;, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook&#39;s &quot;data supernova&quot; is sparking a research boom, driving the number of academic papers with the site&#39;s name in the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn&#39;t get close to with a folder on the street.
&quot;Before, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot;
&quot;You would have to go through the party, and they would never allow you access,&quot; says Bartlett.
&quot;Facebook removes all of that - you go to them directly.&quot;
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address social-health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that college students who discussed their binge exploits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having a drinking problem than students who they remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that the students&#39; peers, such as residential counselors, could monitor the site and step in to help a student who posts too many status updates with their binges.
&quot;You can&#39;t treat a problem if you can&#39;t diagnose it,&quot; said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno&#39;s co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children&#39;s Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
&quot;We have found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise go undiagnosed.&quot;
Facebook is also constantly &quot;poking&quot; its own population for data.
The Data Team of the site has produced statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine&#39;s Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the legislative period of 2010, and a National Happiness index (mainly using the information to which the can access it - advocates of digital freedom have long argued that the site should make its vast amount of data available to others for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not - the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don&#39;t even know about?
While the researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is an open bar for everyone.
&quot;I don&#39;t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be looking at their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, of a 2006 study he conducted with the walls. Facebook audiences of students.
&quot;As far as they were concerned, it was just between them and their friends.&quot;
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know which part of the information on a user&#39;s profile and messages on the wall are true.
&quot;What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,&quot; says Selwyn.
That&#39;s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and a pen are still the best investigative tools anyone can use.
&quot;There is no substitute for getting into the real world and talking to real people,&quot; he says.
&quot;Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of the social still happens offline.&quot;
&quot;Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a &quot;resistance&quot; fighter during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.
&quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights Templar of Norway,&quot; he told a room packed with 500 people.
&quot;I oppose the court because it was mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot;
&quot;I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty.&quot;
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because &quot;he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views.&quot;
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for a further 12 weeks, barred him from the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks. .
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is being held under lock and key.
All attended with the goal of moving towards the conclusion.
&quot;I thought he looked cold and inhuman,&quot; a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
&quot;It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect.&quot;
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik&#39;s strange notion of being part of a larger &quot;resistance&quot; movement, the judge ruled that he is not mentally ill, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may find it comforting that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn&#39;t automatically ease the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
&quot;I&#39;d like it to look like a monster, but it doesn&#39;t,&quot; said a family member of one victim.
&quot;It would be so much easier if it seemed like it.&quot;
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs&#39; Missed Interview, Shown In Theater This Week
After Steve Jobs&#39; death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered Jobs interview dusted off in advance of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about processes. business and product workflows.
He was certainly a self-recognized designer, dreamer, and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and flowchart junkie - a man who believed that many executives suffered from &quot;a disease of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent. of work ... [but] there is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product. &quot;
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds on the dawn of the personal computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that point, it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working hard at his new computer company NeXT, awaiting popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely&#39;s interview was used in Nerds, he said that the originals from the interview disappeared during their transport.
It was only after Jobs&#39; death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director&#39;s garage.
This slightly re-edited footage is the basis for Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, 68 minutes, which hits Landmark theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technology philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and the answers - 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Jobs&#39;s perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient with Cringely&#39;s questions, prompting him to move faster to the more important topics or arguments.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, the iPod, or the iPhone, there is something strangely prescient about The Lost Interview, as Jobs assesses what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own insight into the future of computing.
It&#39;s one thing to read posthumous reviews of Jobs&#39; career, but there is something crude and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the eager dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did it.
A quick recap of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
&quot;Throughout the years in the business, I always asked,&quot; Why do you do things? &quot; and the answers they invariably give you are, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s just the way it&#39;s done.&quot;
Nobody knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That is what I found.
Jobs spells out his efforts to simplify Apple&#39;s accounting.
Bewildered by the way costs were recorded - often starting with a &quot;standard cost&quot; that was done by the eye of the fair, and then adjusted with a &quot;variable&quot; - he developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine costs. retail business.
On the joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the &quot;Blue Box&quot; that he built himself with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and make free long distance calls.
The device has been widely written about, but Jobs&#39;s euphoria here at describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a payphone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&amp;T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
&quot;We were wrapping things around the world a half dozen times and you were yelling through the pay phone and coming back a minute later to the pay phone next door,&quot; Jobs says with a chuckle.
&quot;We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.&quot;
The two of us, we didn&#39;t know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an amazing lesson, and I don&#39;t think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a glorious prank that he and Wozniak almost gave up, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope, while doing his best Henry Kissinger impression.
As various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the Pope himself was awakened to answer the phone.
On falling in love with technology (and selling on the phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and gave him a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs landed a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
&quot;That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.&quot;
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company&#39;s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first desktop computer ever made.&quot;
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a little cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I&#39;d get a trip to HP as a teenager and mess around with that machine and write programs for it.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
Early in his career, as he sold a handful of motherboards, he was asked by a customer if he could assemble all the equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, he had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
&quot;I remember having dramatic plots ... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $ 300], and I got fed up and went outside and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $ 15 that was totally reliable.
On big companies losing steam:
Long before he led Apple&#39;s rebirth, Jobs prophetically envisioned how many industry leaders would stumble on his vision, and lose control of their market share.
&quot;Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers and printers, so what?&quot;
You have a monopoly on market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this class of people who end up running the companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the forum for decision making.
The product genius that led to that monopoly position is rotted away by people who do not have the notion of good products vs. bad products - the necessary knowledge of the trade.
That&#39;s what happened at Xerox ...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s ...
They took defeat from victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
&quot;There is a tremendous amount of work between a great idea and a great product ... as the great idea evolves, changes, and grows.&quot;
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can&#39;t make electrons do, glass does, robots do, factories do.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once ...
In the end it all comes down to taste - it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best that a team of humans has done, and then trying to adapt those things to what you are doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never been ashamed about stealing great ideas.
What in part made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren&#39;t for computing, you could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health care law rivals as court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept President Obama&#39;s challenge to the health care law, two of his justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were entertained at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will present the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a preliminary hearing to carefully study the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the comprehensive healthcare reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
The magistrates agreed to admit the lawsuit and, in fact, a historic 5 and a half hour plea is expected in March, and the result is likely to further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and argue that the law should be thrown out will likely be Paul Clement, who served as the US attorney general during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement&#39;s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner for the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to upholding conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court&#39;s preliminary hearing on the case.
Among those in attendance was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of the healthcare bill.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It&#39;s nothing new: The two justices have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it is not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal magistrates.
If they weren&#39;t, it could be said that they would fall under Canon 4C Code, which reads: &quot;A judge may attend fundraising events of law-related organizations and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honor , or appear in the program of such event. &quot;
However, Scalia and Thomas&#39; sheer proximity to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial stake, was enough to alarm ethics activists in government.
&quot;This staggering ethical gap and disregard for the code runs counter to the demands of multiple magistrates that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause. Common).
&quot;The judges were entertained at a gala fundraiser with attorneys who have cases pending before the court.&quot;
Your appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines any claim for fairness, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say they mix the court&#39;s activity too easily with the agenda pushed by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas&#39;s wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Justice Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan served as attorney general for the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the trial court.
Her critics have lobbied for Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in upholding the law to be impartial now.
Kagan has not given any indication that he will.
Boeing Receives Record Order Of $ 18 Billion
Emirates airline is ordering 50 double-aisle Boeing 777 aircraft, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner jets to Oman Air, a deal valued at more than $ 1 billion.
It is seldom news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But it&#39;s a big deal when the company is aircraft maker Boeing Co. and the sale price for all 50 planes is a record $ 18 billion.
It&#39;s as big as where Boeing got the order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $ 450 billion.
Over the weekend, Boeing announced its largest commercial jet order ever for dollar value - 50 Boing 777 twin-aisle jets.
The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, bringing the total sales price to $ 26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow.
Then on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts spectacular fuel economy and passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
&quot;This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing,&quot; said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
&quot;The quality of these particular clients is very strong.&quot;
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
So not only do they have the money to pay for planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually bad for airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so bad, because the country is making money from rising oil prices.
That&#39;s important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
&quot;They have natural protection,&quot; he said.
The Emirates order solidifies Boeing&#39;s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps hold off competitor Airbus SAS&#39;s attempt to invade its dominance with the A350 airliner.
Boeing&#39;s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it was delaying the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Shares of Boeing Co rose 1.5% to $ 67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the Michoacán vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the gubernatorial race.
President Felipe Calderón&#39;s sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the violent state&#39;s elections, and she claimed Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
&quot;The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the entire country,&quot; Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview the day after Sunday&#39;s vote.
&quot;They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers ... They seized the polls, installed barricades ... and ordered people to vote&quot; in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly outperformed Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate for his brother&#39;s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the post of governor, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left ahead of the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also declined to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied ties to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamine.
It is President Calderón&#39;s home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a targeted military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was assassinated a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidacies out of fear.
Although for the PRI, as unpleasant as the Michoacán elections may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: &quot;I think this victory should be very encouraging, looking ahead to next year.&quot;
ADB urges Asia to help rescue eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would impede the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, CEO of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said that the world&#39;s two largest fastest-growing economies had to &quot;do everything possible&quot; to accelerate the economic bloc&#39;s recovery either through the International Monetary Fund. or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that view Europe&#39;s difficulties in an &quot;impartial&quot; way and said that financial assistance from Asia coupled with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
&quot;We are all in this together.&quot;
&quot;So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful,&quot; he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
&quot;Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune.&quot;
&quot;So if China and India can help, let it be by all means.&quot;
The European monetary union has been seriously undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy&#39;s borrowing costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has heightened fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has sparked calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power. for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that &quot;India will do everything possible&quot; to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows.
&quot;Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,&quot; he said.
&quot;We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.&quot;
&quot;It is not an option, it is an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women.&quot;
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India&#39;s 1.2 billion people, of whom up to 800 million live on about $ 2. a day or less.
&quot;At some point they will realize that Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on vacation to the beaches and that will not go down well,&quot; he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India&#39;s reserves should be used to keep the many well-paid Greek public sector workers in poorly managed, loss-making jobs. like the railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens &quot;major knock-on effects&quot; across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces &quot;downside risks&quot; due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make &quot;contingency plans&quot; to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta heated up Congress on Monday, warning that looming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and spark a financial chain reaction from the corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan. to civil assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $ 450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears a further reduction of $ 600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to agree on it. spending.
&quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,&quot; Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said Congress&#39;s failure to agree on the budget and its consequence, the so-called &quot;hijacking,&quot; would lead to 23 percent global cuts and a halt to many new projects.
&quot;Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate manner, would render most of our naval and construction projects unrealizable - you can&#39;t buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts. &quot;Panetta wrote to the senators.
&quot;We would also be forced to unintentionally remove many of our civil servants, and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to discharge civilians in order to meet the objective.&quot;
&quot;These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage goodwill.&quot;
The cuts would eventually catch up with combat troops, Panetta said.
&quot;While wartime funding in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by hijacking, war efforts would be adversely affected by serious disruptions in core budgets,&quot; warned Panetta.
&quot;Hiring of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and contract supervision that supports the war.&quot;
&quot;Personnel on payroll would be reduced, leading to delayed payments to providers in wartime, and legal and political support would be cut off.&quot;
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of the automatic cuts on the Defense Department.
&quot;The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the world&#39;s leading military power.&quot;
&quot;We are firmly against this draconian action,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta&#39;s letter.
&quot;This is not an outcome you can live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.&quot;
&quot;Kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and should not be allowed to occur.&quot;
Whether Panetta&#39;s letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about possible cuts, even though he came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budget experience in Congress and the White House and knowing he faced tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a grim picture of what might lie ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
&quot;It is a ship without sailors.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a squad without bullets.&quot;
&quot;It is an air wing without enough trained pilots.&quot;
&quot;It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to accomplish the mission,&quot; Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
&quot;It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential adversaries.&quot;
&quot;Indeed, it invites aggression ...&quot;
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlines new details of how the reductions &quot;create significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be previously deployed and engaged in everyone; and it poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations. &quot;
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could tackle the ax, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter jet, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could generate an estimated $ 80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the vital next step in improving and tackling potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A glance at the latest headlines tells us how serious and pervasive deception and lying are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy trading sexual harassment allegations with several women; each party accuses the other of lying.
Administrators at Pennsylvania State University have been charged with perjury for allegedly hiding reports that a retired soccer coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was &quot;caught&quot; with an open microphone claiming to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself with his denials quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to covering up an extramarital affair.
And again, no one who lived through it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about cheating on school and college exams are widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given test answers to students in order to be better seen in their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find ourselves?
On any given day, studies show that you can be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That&#39;s for sure, many of those lies are white lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or &quot;locating lies&quot;, is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the objective is to exclaim: &quot;I have you&quot;, the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that conducted in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been dispelled.
Liars do look eye to eye.
They don&#39;t always stutter, stammer, blush, or fidget.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can get to the truth by learning about statement structure, microfacial expressions, question formation, and timing.
I spent several years probing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world - especially if its responsibilities Professionals include recruiting, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more &quot;self-oriented lies&quot;, while women tell more &quot;other-oriented&quot; lies - usually to protect someone&#39;s feelings - that married people lie to their partners less frequently than unmarried people (but the lies they often tell tend to be &quot;huge&quot;).
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the habitual behavior of the subject.
This is called &quot;creating a baseline.&quot;
Helps provide benchmarks to measure changes later.
Observe the subject&#39;s posture, laughter, and vocal characteristic.
You better know if someone normally taps their feet all the time so that you don&#39;t make unfair accusations when you see their feet tapping in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for deceptive, verbal and non-verbal groups of behavior.
View these behavioral groups as red flags, not proof of deception.
Cheating people may freeze their upper body when trying to recall their story, point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit &quot;post-interview relief&quot; - that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the tough questions are over.
Interrogators often falsely pretend the interview is over just to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the vocabulary of the subject.
Scott Peterson really screwed up and used the past tense while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
Cheaters may also use distancing language: &quot;I did not have sex with that woman ... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or repeat a difficult question in its entirety.
The most common verbal cues are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of &quot;restrictive language&quot; when answering a difficult question: &quot;Well ... to tell the truth ... as far as I know ... as far as I know.&quot;
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a red flag.
There is no magic bullet for detecting lies, but developing deception skills is possible.
These skills will improve anyone&#39;s chances to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial pipeline plan diverted following threat of US delay in approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - angering unions, while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline out of Nebraska&#39;s environmentally sensitive Sandhills area, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a news conference on the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada CEO Alex Pourbax says the company maintains its confidence that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different route.
This follows the announcement last week by the State Department that they would delay a decision on a federal permit for the project until potential new routes that bypass the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a vast supply of water, are studied. underground water.
&quot;This is a real avenue of progress,&quot; Rep. Lee Terry, R-Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to set aside any decision until 2013, after next year&#39;s election, though officials denied politics was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department&#39;s request, and expressed his full support.
The 1,700-kilometer pipeline would run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would bring 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would need to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by work groups, who have opted for the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department&#39;s current environmental impact study found that the project posed only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department&#39;s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether TransCanada&#39;s hired lobbyist Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign advisor in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle behaved like crazy in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrifying her young daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
The &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; singer&#39;s tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered &quot;personality changes, sleep disorders&quot; and &quot;increased her fear of strangers,&quot; her family says in Supreme Court from Manhattan.
It was November 10 of last year when stagehand Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were getting ready to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk got into the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
&quot;Someone came up behind me and said, &#39;Do you know what your daughter is doing?&#39; I said &#39;yes&#39; and went to get it, &quot;he said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
&quot;He said in an aggressive tone,&quot; You shouldn&#39;t have left your daughter near the door, &quot;Roseanna Monk said.
&quot;I said,&quot; I have no interest in what you say or think. &quot;
He became enraged and started using bad words - the C word and the J word out loud ...
He had a bottle of water and he started pouring the water from the bottle on me. &quot;
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
&quot;I said to this woman, &#39;Look what you&#39;ve done to my daughter,&quot; said the girl&#39;s mother.
LaBelle pounced on the mother - who was still holding Genevieve - and had to be restrained by her surroundings and pulled into a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard she vomited, he added.
The family later sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but got no response.
LaBelle&#39;s attorney and representatives did not return calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family&#39;s attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money it gets to an association that supports children with cancer.
&quot;The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct,&quot; Davis said.
&quot;That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when targeting a kindergarten teacher holding an 18-month-old child.&quot;
Climate adversity slowed the economy
During Mario López Valdez&#39;s first year in office, unemployment and informality increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment fell and the economy contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-described change, which generated great expectations regarding the progress in the economy, but given the initial climatic adversity of the year, no growth is observed, on the other hand there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millionaire losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic drop of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost damage, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582 thousand 835 cultivated hectares were damaged, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage. , the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chickpea.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55,053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent , a rate that in number of people throws more than 74 thousand unemployed Sinaloans, an increase compared to the first semester of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be indirectly explained, depending on the actions that public policy have made.
&quot;What you are seeing is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation that was approved in Congress to combat money laundering. It is not easy for people who take dollars illegally to work them, invest them and use them in something, &quot;he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
&quot;The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and secondly because entering they already have many difficulties to find work, these people are staying and it is demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise, &quot;he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is aggravated when considering the high level of informality that prevails among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being contributing as a worker to any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state&#39;s labor lags are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
FDI contraction
In addition to the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the greatest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy, from January to June, state FDI amounted to 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a drop of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars registered during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government recorded a total investment of 17 thousand 280 million pesos in the year, which occurred mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
Faced with the scenario of economic contraction, the state government in July requested the state congress to approve a loan for 3 billion pesos, which would be used for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2,600 million pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of wills of the different sectors, including the State Government itself.
&quot;The performance of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, it was necessary to align the efforts of all and especially the good the synchronized march of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better, &quot;he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
&quot;The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had, &quot;he mentioned.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers&#39; Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that it is necessary to channel the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
&quot;In general terms we have observed that work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material resource and human that Sinaloa has, &quot;he said.
Work to be done
The president of Coparmex highlighted the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government&#39;s efforts.
&quot;In general terms, I would say that the government has been striving to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances but it is important that a long-term program be developed,&quot; he said.
He pointed out that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
&quot;There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done and I believe that the Government is aware that there is work to be done,&quot; he said.
They convicted him of 8 kgs of marijuana
A Navolato neighbor was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for possessing eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General&#39;s Office reported that the drug dealer sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the file AP / SIN / CLN / 687/2010 / MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by elements of the Mexican Army, on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of the post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.

Must contributions for works
The works of a social nature contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of municipal Social Development indicated that although the work programs have advanced so far, they are at risk as the State Government has not complied with the contributions that correspond to it, which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos. in all three programs.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent corresponds to the State and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these becomes effective.
&quot;They are almost 12 million what they have to contribute and although the year is about to end they have not given us even a fifth, when since July they had to give us a part,&quot; he said, &quot;in order not to delay we have started the works and they are going very advanced, but we need the money. &quot;
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a loan to cover the more than 7 million that it did not contribute. on that occasion the state administration.
&quot;It already happened to us in the previous six-year term because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued walking, and this year, in order to access these programs, we had to find the resources to cover what the State left pending,&quot; he explained. .
Although there is the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that a request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to speed up the steps so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible. possible.
&quot;There are almost 12 million they have to contribute and despite the fact that the year is about to end they have not given us even a fifth.&quot;
Court validates &quot;analog blackout&quot; in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has undergone in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called &quot;analog blackout&quot; from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when issuing the decree that details the actions to be followed to complete the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed because it did not reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft judgment, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the reservation of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself voted in favor of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it provided for the digital transition.
The plenary session of ministers also resolved to reject the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister-president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal Executive cannot structure the measures for the public administration to prepare through general norms.
&quot;Nor do I consider that if it did, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected,&quot; and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector corresponds to the federal Executive, which has by constitutional mandate, the rectory of the State.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has undergone in recent years, and it translates into better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the change, he argued, would be postponing the benefits of digitization, which implies a decision in the public interest, which does not only have a technical dimension, &quot;since it encompasses economic, social, political and national security issues.&quot;
These issues, he stressed, &quot;require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic stewardship of the State, encompassing a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the faculty of the State Executive.&quot;
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, that in any way invades the sphere of competences of Congress, since the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative is being provided in the administrative sphere, he assured.
They analyze the possibility of a &quot;vote by vote&quot; count in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor&#39;s election is barely 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting &quot;vote by vote&quot; is a reality with regard to this year&#39;s electoral process in Michoacán, where, according to the data provided by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place of the governor&#39;s election is barely 27 percent, still without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just last November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local regulations with federal reform in electoral matters.
As it will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to come into effect in this process. election and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the deadlines provided in the Official State Newspaper Law, arguing that he had some objections.
On the same November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and classified as &quot;invalid and illegal&quot; the vote of the state president to the constitutional reforms, since it does not have right to &quot;sanction or veto&quot; them.
Interviewed about the possibility of &quot;vote by vote&quot;, María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may occur in the cases that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; There is no tally and count record in the polling station file or it is not in the possession of the president of the same; or, when there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the votes received in all the polls of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the presumed winner of the election in question and the one who obtained the second place in the vote, is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express request from the representative of the party and / or coalition that nominated the second of the indicated candidates.
The total count of the vote may also be carried out if, at the end of the ordinary count, it is established that the difference between the presumed winning candidate and the candidate placed in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate came in second place, in which case electoral packages that have undergone partial recount will be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that in this situation is the Morelia election, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of economic disaster
Italian Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and put the entire eurozone in jeopardy.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet made up mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
&quot;I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase,&quot; the former European commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he will be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The &quot;framework is now well delineated,&quot; he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, as Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must pass a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain battered confidence in Italy.
Underscoring the pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability pushed the yield on Italian 10-year BTP bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to bail out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers&#39; association Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: &quot;We said we would support this government a lot.&quot;
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti&#39;s chances of success were boosted considerably by the PDL party&#39;s backing of Silvio Berlusconi, who the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
&quot;We believe that Professor Monti&#39;s efforts are destined to have a good result,&quot; Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy&#39;s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in your efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women&#39;s organizations, on Monday.
He will end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Bailing out Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.
Monti has said his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be made up only of technicians, an indication of his reservations about a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The touch of the Spanish is higher than that of the Ticos
Of the 22 soccer players called from Spain, ten exceed 50 international games.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 summoned reached 50 matches.
A major contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 summoned by both countries for today&#39;s friendly, at 3:05 pm, at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and European champions, number one in the monthly FIFA rankings, have a wide record of games between class A teams, the Tricolor only has defender Michael Umaña as the only one to have all 50 international matches.
This figure was reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain intense activity in league and domestic cup championships each year, and high-level clashes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To this is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifying rounds of the Eurocup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have limited international contact in one area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish National Team is that of goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (0-1 loss in London) equaled the record of exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and will set a new record for Spain of 127 caps.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona&#39;s cerebral midfielder, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the week before by UEFA along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke striker, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost close to the centennial figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
They are followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umaña, are the left back Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After there, only five surpassed 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest are not close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet debuted.
The historical scorer for Spain is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one with the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in its two-decade-long celebration tour
&quot;Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true&quot;
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam&#39;s bassist Jeff Ament said that the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday, at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them it will also make the dream of playing in the country a reality.
This was stated by the bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is on the South American wing of its tour celebrating two decades of work and on Sunday 20 it will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 pm, along with the Los Angeles band The X and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcription of which is in La Nación on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican fans, it is a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I have been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; It is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to stay there for a few days.
So we are excited to bring our music there.
I ask him because there is a kind of devotion towards the band, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What do they say to their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long to get there.
Some people already refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we&#39;ve played in the last 21 years happened in the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are incredible.
My friends always went surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that&#39;s how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we&#39;ve never played there before, then we don&#39;t have any restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; We will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is this about?
I think it&#39;s partially because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it&#39;s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven&#39;t played for a long time, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we may have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of experience.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all that you have accomplished?
Yes absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us imagined that we would be in a great rock band and having done it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we love creating music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world that we always wanted to go.
Things couldn&#39;t be better for us.
What did it mean for you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be a part of that group of great bands.
We are very close friends with the folks at Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and it is rare.
Every once in a while, a band emerges from a city, but it is much weirder when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be a part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour so we are lucky to still be friends with all of them and we are honored to be a part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It is also very strange that a band like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yeah, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is a lot longer than many bands last.
First of all, I think we are all lucky to still be alive, and second, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also opened that give everyone freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other&#39;s music and it couldn&#39;t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to their success, they have been able to do whatever they want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure we don&#39;t tour too much because it&#39;s easy to fall for that game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it, without being infatuated with being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
How do you remember your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and in the beginning it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and we never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were many frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very close friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy It was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and soccer and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with various proposals and that was the band that we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That&#39;s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don&#39;t know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to mind.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first that come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, CJ Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski ...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists that I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant despite not being a trend anymore?
I think all of us always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came out at the same time, and if there is relevance now, I think it is a wonderful thing because it is music that is worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney they are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
Why the change?
It&#39;s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that maybe seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they can sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there is some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs undoubtedly represent that to me.
Also, I believe that you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is admitted again for medical exams
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his family doctor reported.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various ailments, including cancer of the tongue for which he has undergone four operations and that is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He was operated on four times for cancer of the tongue, he has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other pathologies have been added such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems circulatory in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the first years of his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point in an extensive agenda of meetings with political and commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community residing in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be &quot;conducive to the exchange of information on all that is political affairs between the two nations,&quot; as published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation with its ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has presided over the G20, a group made up of the world&#39;s most powerful emerging and developed countries, and has in force with the South American country, since January of this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the conclusion of fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the &quot;gray list&quot; of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), made up of countries that did not implement all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004 that has increased the exchange of goods between both nations.
The mustachioed plumber goes three dimensions with &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot;
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before has he done it in three dimensions: in &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology
The title, which hits stores around the world this month, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
&quot;Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses,&quot; said Nintendo&#39;s specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;the first Nintendo video game originally intended for that support&quot;, since until now hits such as &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D&quot; were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is an &quot;accessible&quot; video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez has stated that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; contains two games in one: the first part is &quot;simple&quot; to hook less skilled users.
Once passed, the most expert will be able to give a &quot;second round&quot; to the game levels, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an &quot;aggressive D&quot; or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and &quot;not succumb to optical illusions&quot;.
This incursion of Super Mario in three dimensions also means the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the formula for the success of the previous installments, consisting of the fact that the plumber with the mustache will have to travel platforms mined with dangers in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a &quot;playable&quot; Luigi.
Colom supports the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had processed the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder US $ 70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to try him there.
In a press conference, Colom affirmed that his decision is due to the independence of the judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a sentencing court had already ordered the extradition.
He asserted that during his tenure &quot;he did not put his hands&quot; in judicial decisions and processed all the extraditions that he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What was done by Colom supposes an executive procedure after all judicial and constitutional instances to prosecute the former president of between 2000 and 2004 were exhausted.
According to resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once he has resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the fall in the marginalization of boys without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support organization is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
To this is added the long hundred jobs currently obtained for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an event held in the old Fabra i Coats factory complex, which was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with drug addiction problems or in a situation of becoming marginalized.
Yesterday&#39;s celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of heads of entities and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the ex-minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the ex-mayor and current eco-socialist councilor Ricard Gomà attended the event.
The current Minister of Welfare and Family Welfare, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of La Caixa&#39;s social work, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the great hall of the Fabra i Coats.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is too, but added that the work done so far &quot;is a good foundation.&quot;
The president put Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight against bad circumstances and for giving hope to people in difficulties.
&quot;The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,&quot; he said.
Evicted a squatted farm where macro-parties were held
The invaders had taken over 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm yesterday noon without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the residents of 51 Calle de Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the property that they were occupying illegally at noon yesterday, and where they organized macro-parties that made the neighborhood desperate, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was finished, the door lock was changed to avoid a repeat of the situation.
&quot;From now on there will be access control,&quot; said the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building -the rest are inhabited-, took away all the electrical installation and part of the water installation, in addition to painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially beverage cans. alcoholic.
The first three floors were the scene of massive parties, which lasted up to two days and made the tenants desperate.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub points out that the invaders of the farm made her unfair competition, since they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the disco they cost 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment venue had had to respond to neighborhood complaints about noise, while, as she pointed out, the annoyances are not caused by the clients of the nightclub, but by the inhabitants of the squatted house and, above all, those attending the Parties being organized there, which had increased in frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to angry neighbors in the area.
The person in charge of the nightclub explained that the annoyances were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago he &quot;forgives&quot; the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had demanded last week &quot;to immediately vacate the property to end the problems of coexistence and civility that they cause to the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area&quot; .
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last few months the squatters had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some there had even been robberies.
In this sense, he added that, &quot;it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incitement that has been generated on the farm.&quot;
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 pm the police went to 35 Carrer de Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people entering the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversies about fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now defunct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional posters for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York&#39;s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park was once again located, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital one of the few that are not oriented in the north-south axis but up (mountain ) -down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park results in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these it was until, in September, the city council called a mega-competition composed of 16 contests for as many access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of a park, without a doubt.
Either that or someone intends to put doors to the field.
The question comes out alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it means to reflect on the city, is the topic of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring theme to draw upon when two members of this ancient chosen caste recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects think, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastline &quot;it is necessary&quot; to discuss &quot;the mountain front&quot;, since Ildefons Cerdà&#39;s speech, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
&quot;It should be assumed that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex &quot;, says the architect for whom the title of&quot; Collserola gates &quot;contains a&quot; lexical trap &quot;: one should not think of them&quot; as the entrances to a park, but rather the delimitation of areas where it is necessary to act &quot;.
Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal as an &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; with &quot;some dangers&quot;.
Dangers derived from the &quot;uncertainty that it is today to project public space&quot; after the experience lived in the 80s and that &quot;his swan song&quot; had in the Forum area.
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
&quot;To limit something is to fix the next step&quot;, that is, its overstepping.
&quot;You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can give rise to real disasters.&quot;
Closer to the question, Mòdol believes that, simplifying, the Collserola slope of the valley &quot;can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona cannot&quot;, for a merely topographical question.
Mòdol recalls that there is already a job done by the Patronat de Collserola that &quot;should not fall on deaf ears&quot;, although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers his union to intervene in this project &quot;from the first moment&quot;.
And even more, he understands that the mountain&#39;s proximity to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter the debate, but he &quot;doubts&quot; whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams (&quot;quite a success&quot; , points out) that have had to be created: &quot;We architects should only be a tool.&quot;
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because the bases of the contest lack a global vision of Collserola: &quot;16 transversal competitions have been called,&quot; he says, &quot;in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no a longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole &quot;.
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may clash in program and definition with that of the architect next door.
In his opinion, yes, the city council should guarantee that the strip immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of facilities that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will go free
After 72 days of arraigo, the legal representative of the Casino Red granted the pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed for alleged blackmail
After spending 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of Casino Red granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which is following a process for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee so that the Monterrey city council would allow the clandestine operation of the betting house.
After the public complaint, the State Attorney&#39;s Office opened a criminal proceeding against the brother of the PAN mayor and on September 2 he was detained and held for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry 3 in Property Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State capital.
In that place he remained for the following 49 days when a second arrest warrant was issued after the agent of the Public Ministry dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison for allegedly blackmailing the owners of the Red Casino with a million and a half pesos; however, he only remained in the medium security prison for a few hours as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigations, sufficient evidence was verified to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as the collection of 1.5 million of pesos to the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went before the judge José Luis Pecina to request a pardon for the brother of the royal mayor; so that in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the agent of the Public Ministry attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the partners of the betting house was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the Name.
Based on the file 197/2011 legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and henceforth no claim may be filed regarding the process that was followed; In addition, no reparation for damage or punishment will be required.
After the hearing with the legal representative of the bookmaker, around 3:50 p.m., the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The court clerk, Jorge Yánez, went to the San Nicolás de los Garza municipality jail to notify Jonás that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be archived.
It will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash in which the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven other people lost his life
The Ministry of Communications and Transportation (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people lost his life, indicate that the helicopter directly impacted on the ground in complete integrity structural, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot verified that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
&quot;The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees 25 meters away where the unit lost the fuselage.&quot;
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport personnel.
In addition, he said that in the investigations carried out in the impact zone, the appearance of pieces on the ground was not reported.
&quot;In a search they reported that there are no parts or components of the ship in another place, the impact was structurally present.
&quot;The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport the passengers.
The terrain presents a slope of seven degrees at a 30 degree incline.
For the moment, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results possible beforehand; however, the investigation can last several months, it could even reach a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that at the time of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was operating at cruising speed and that this happened on an ascending soft ground.
&quot;This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact,&quot; he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM located suitable conditions for takeoff, as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, layers of cloud cover appeared at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloudy conditions, the crew sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft wreckage in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and sideways trajectory.
The dispersion pattern of the aircraft debris allows us to assume that the helicopter hit the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion detected:
At the scene of the accident, evidence of some kind of explosion or fire has not been revealed in the remains of the ship.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the field.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above mean sea level, the terrain presents a slope that ranges from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably dismantled along that route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a meticulous search in an area wider than the cordoned off site, around the accident, no scattered pieces of the aircraft have been found, which strengthens the presumption that the impact occurred in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security conducts research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; is supported by specialists from the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the &#39;Genetics of childhood and adolescent obesity&#39; protocol, which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital de Especialidades of the Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research, the population is invited to participate, whether or not it is entitled, to go to the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out on minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m. hours.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Poniente) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (East Mexico State).
Once the goal of reuniting 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
When celebrating World Diabetes Day on November 14, he specified that the objective is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on food .
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure measurement, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic measurements are applied to all participants (it seeks to identify genes that are associated to childhood obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this investigation is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
&#39;The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed &#39;, highlighted the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country&#39;s population differs from others due to its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which makes it possible to detect whether they are overweight or obese.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm, which indicates the probability that he suffers from metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, the doctors deliver it in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measurements and the changes in the lifestyle that they must make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day sitting in front of the television and using means of transport instead of walking distances short.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, that is, the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content, and the genetics that are analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions.
If the signals sent by the pavement were heeded, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 thousand potholes each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate, potholes could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated completely.
In his conference A technological opinion on potholes, given within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his charge develops polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with a greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some with high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others with low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, close to 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but it is modified during the day according to the environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warned.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is made up of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt layer, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the pebbles that make up the folder, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles travel and efforts are generated, it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, they would spread even better, said the chemical engineer.
On top of the asphalt mat, he added, a last layer called the tread mat is placed, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the vehicle tires, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt mat and provide friction on the road.
As it is the part of the pavement that is going to receive and diffuse the efforts, the rolling mat also requires having the appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it considerably affects the performance of the asphalt mat.
When the ground gets wet, the water diffuses into the interior of the mat and is difficult to get out, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a pothole, he said, the first to wear out is the bearing film and only afterwards is the asphalt layer affected, but the damage does not occur instantaneously, it is a process that should be attended to at the first signs with adequate maintenance schedules.
The also member of the National System of Investigators explained that the vehicular load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always be in relation to the vehicular load and guarantee that they are Comply, to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to research and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow potholes to be repaired easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate of the Valley lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that led to Melina Ramírez Serna not reaching the crown of Señorita Colombia.
El Valle receives her 14th title of princess.
Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire for the crown of Señorita Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the winners&#39; podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico won the crown and the scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of Vallecaucan women who have been close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many are asking is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was she elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie de Vogue, titles that won queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Señorita Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision made by the jury to appoint her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question &quot;What is this book that has marked you and why? Made by Martín Murillo Gómez , from the Leamos Literary Cart.
To the question, the Valle de Caucana responded:
&quot;I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it is a way of culturalizing oneself, I definitely think that the book that marked me as a child is&quot; The Little Prince &quot;, it is a fairly profound book.
Currently I read &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, it is a universal literature book that we all must read; and today I am reading the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called &quot;Burning Blood.&quot;
An answer that was not liked first by the term &quot;culturalize&quot; and second by not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he cited has marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony, Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result &quot;the universe is wise no matter what has to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little bit, &quot;The Little Prince&quot; is a great book &quot;
Among the hypotheses launched, it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogotá hinted that being the favorite, the applauded and the candidate who won all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best artisan costume, and Queen Mother), &quot;that aroused the jealousy of the others candidates, it stressed the queen and that&#39;s why she didn&#39;t shine on stage. &quot;
And it showed in her first swimsuit performance on the beach at the Hilton and her two coronation evening shows.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noted that she lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico did show.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the program &quot;Como en casa&quot;, of the RCN Channel, said that the fact that Melina was designated princess &quot;proves that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain as queen.&quot;
In addition, Valle was at last very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For something, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
&quot;Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on their social sensitivity, that before entering the Contest they are already involved in projects,&quot; he explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned due to her defects in the derriere and the fibrosis that was noticeable in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate &#39;Natural Beauty&#39; with a healthier body, good nutrition and physical work responsable.
The queen trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, &quot;but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, which the truth was not very noticeable for me, lowered her points on the last day.&quot;
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos, from the Cromos magazine, considers that the error of the Valle del Cauca was the surgical interventions that were carried out.
&quot;The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn&#39;t know how to do them.
His body was never his strong suit and here they charged him. &quot;
For this award, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in a bathing suit a cruel prediction arose that last night was fulfilled, because it was said that this was the contentment that Raymundo granted Melina for not giving her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins a year of reign today, not as sovereign, but as princess, a position that offers her the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, eluded the crown.
This was the work of the Caleño who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lofoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of &quot;Alfonso Cano.&quot;
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lofoscopist from the CTI of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top FARC chief: &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;, by checking his fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopists who work in the CTI section, that week it was the turn of &quot;availability&quot; to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the judicial investigation area for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to go into the jungle for more than five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and, after taking the corresponding courses, he specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is, of the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to wear clothes for at least three days.
Something great awaited him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry the ten-digit card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site where the body was found, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local peasant, without glasses, and much thinner.
But the footprints don&#39;t lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter, and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints on the corpse with those on the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was &quot;Alfonso Cano.&quot;
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the top FARC chief.
In search of the footprint
For a fingerprint specialist from the Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González at the press conference for the operation against &quot;Cano&quot; is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Fingerprinting is an exact science, with no margin for error, which can be key in solving crimes.
Apart from identifying corpses, lofoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of those captured.
When caught, many criminals present false IDs or do not have papers.
We take their fingerprints and look them up in the database.
The investigator said that, in a theft case, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to remove a safe full of jewels and money.
&quot;The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to take a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to obtain the print of the entire hand and identify the criminal, who had participated in different thefts,&quot; he recalled.
Fingerprints can also rule out or reaffirm suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be a suspect in the crime and, indeed, a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the murderer, it does locate him at the crime scene.
A fingerprint specialist from the CTI explained that on the objects &quot;the prints are taken with chemical or physical reagents.&quot;
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registrar&#39;s Office.
&quot;The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,&quot; said the CTI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as it is shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not everything that glitters is gold, not everything that is touched becomes a mark.
However, if it can be used, if the respective comparison is made.
The &quot;indignant&quot; challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered outside Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part complied with the eviction order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, under the protection of a court order, the Manhattan square from where they were evicted at dawn and by trying to occupy another park in the big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the &quot;indignant&quot; to go back to camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city , where there have been new arrests.
&quot;Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to go back to camp in the square, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,&quot; said one of the spokesmen of the movement &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot;, Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the &quot;outraged&quot; to the eviction of their camp dictated personally by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the &quot;indignant&quot; proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish. of Trinity Church.
For at least an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are several hundred people who had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in support of the members of the movement and that they have tried to mediate with the Police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square -which is a privately owned compound- is still closed pending the holding of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation this morning must be analyzed.
Some of the protesters displaced there carried and distributed copies of that court order at this time and even handed them over to the agents who were guarding the square, which caused &quot;some small clashes,&quot; said Bray, who denounced that some officers struck at protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting Occupy Wall Street members or enforcing &quot;laws that were issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with stores or other properties they previously used.&quot;
Mayor Bloomberg indicated to the press that, due to that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, alerting them, however, that local laws do not allow them to reopen with retail stores. campaign and sleeping bags.
The councilor personally defended the eviction carried out at dawn from Zuccotti Square, an operation in which around 200 arrests were made and which was decided because the protesters were &quot;breaking the law.&quot;
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming &quot;a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people&quot;, since &quot;some businesses had received threats&quot; and neighbors feared &quot;for their quality of life.&quot;
&quot;The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that deep down Bloomberg is more interested in preserving financial interests than those of American workers,&quot; added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of &quot;disrespecting the freedom of expression&quot;.
Those responsible for &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; also indicated that they plan to organize &quot;big actions&quot; for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests last, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson to play the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show &quot;It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen&#39;s assistant in &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, lifeguard in &quot;Baywatch&quot;, playmate in &quot;Playboy&quot;, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with &quot;crooner&quot; (balladeer) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program &quot;It&#39;s a Russell Peters Christmas&quot; on December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images from the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the Internet of a pornographic home video in which she appears together with her then-husband, &quot;Mötley Crüe&quot; drummer Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus in a manger.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian Indian-born comedian who recently hosted part of Charlie Sheen&#39;s &quot;My Violent Torpedo of Truth&quot; tour, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV&#39;s Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a &quot;bitch&quot; during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of falls that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still convalescing from the devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the Japanese country suffered since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo put the material losses in 300,000 million dollars, a blow that, despite the difficult world context, seems to have lessened.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to turn the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in an annualized rate.
The one registered in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest growth rate since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the rise in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the true boost of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crises to reinforce - or rebuild - the infrastructures, to use the deficiencies to grow from zero.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed 1%, driven by the increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market, when the yen - Japan&#39;s currency - has become one of the &quot;safe havens&quot; chosen by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky forecasts of the US. ., a privilege that weighs heavily on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic waterline is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed their weak results between July and September to the price of the yen.
As the markets continue their siege to the peripheral countries of the EU, the government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower its guard.
&quot;We must be attentive to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,&quot; said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) specified that most member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the world economy highlighted that the major powers are holding back.
Since it fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone, even, was below the average, which is at the level 100, falling eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds doubts again
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums soaring and uncertainty reinstated in the trading floors, Greece continues to get tangled up in the labyrinth that leads towards the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new Hellenic transitional government is imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed upon in his appointment may be too short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that it will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated its demand for new elections for the scheduled date, February 19.
&quot;The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit,&quot; Papadimos said when opening a parliamentary debate yesterday that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package with 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras&#39; message does not clear any doubts about his position: &quot;We have committed ourselves to help the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else.&quot;
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the organizations that must unblock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the settings.
But the European Commission, still stung by the impact caused by the order of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign &quot;a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible. &quot;
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors will return &quot;very soon&quot; to Athens to discuss with the new government &quot;what is needed to pay the sixth tranche&quot; of 8,000 million, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek skein still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofía: &quot;They are instruments for progress and hope&quot;
The Queen highlights the &quot;preponderant&quot; place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain &quot;has reached a prominent place worldwide in the role of Microfinance&quot;.
Queen Sofía recalled yesterday that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the plan in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose &quot;essence&quot; she pointed out that it lies in being an &quot;instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being. &quot;
The Queen opened yesterday the V World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that &quot;there is no doubt&quot; that these types of operations are &quot;absolutely essential&quot; to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with a horizon of 2015, and, &quot; very especially, in the one whose goal is to reduce by half the volume of people who live with incomes of less than one dollar a day, with which the &quot;poverty threshold&quot; is set.
Spain &quot;continues working&quot; to expand the network of beneficiaries &quot;to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with&quot; responsibility, &quot;said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate in the Summit, which will last until on Thursday, &quot;guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women&quot;, the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are &quot;many achievements&quot; and &quot;many challenges we face.&quot;
The Microcredit Summit is proposed not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to promote &quot;two basic goals.&quot;
Thus, His Majesty explained that it is hoped that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families that have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of those households will leave the poverty line in which they are immersed.
The impulse in the conception of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world &quot;has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering way&quot; by Muhammad Yunus, Doña Sofía highlighted as an &quot;act of justice and due recognition&quot;.
And it is that he described the father of this tool as an &quot;admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty&quot;, whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about its loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and &quot;in all of them I have been able to verify the continuous evolution,&quot; explained His Majesty, whose link with yesterday this project earned him the qualification of the &quot;head of the family&quot; gathered in Valladolid by the &quot;baquero of the poor&quot;.
Finally, Queen Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
&quot;Ethical imperative&quot;
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity &quot;is an ethical imperative&quot; for every democratic state.
In this sense, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, since it is a &quot;permanent obligation.&quot;
Jiménez considered that microcredits suppose &quot;a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty&quot;, and now &quot;more than ever&quot; the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be a victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of &quot;one of the main lines of development cooperation&quot;.
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded &quot;the success&quot; of giving &quot;confidence&quot; to people &quot;excluded to whom everyone closes the doors&quot;; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that &quot;opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity.&quot;
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic party.
The future of Europe had not initially been on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy militants who consider that the government&#39;s policy is currently too lax with the Greeks and could be so in a future. future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted practically unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were registered.
The standing ovation of several minutes that they won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clears any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe, but more Europe&quot;.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot;
For the Chancellor, &quot;the time has come to open the way in Europe.&quot;
This could manifest itself in modifications of the Lisbon Treaty to allow the strengthening of the European Union&#39;s control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to &quot;give a face to Europe &quot;.
In any case, that is one of the proposals in the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Clearly, it is unlikely that the 27 will quickly come to terms with this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, the delegates have rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the weight of each country in the directive of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce the weight of Germany.
Eager to calm the spirits within her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But neither is it that he has tried to win over his congress at the expense of &quot;small&quot; European countries or countries in difficulty ready to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe dedicates a section to the importance of &quot;Franco-German friendship&quot;, Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.
Except in passing.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon&#39;s army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a fund responsible for family allowances and deliver a speech on the subject, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and assistantships.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which starts from the will to save rigorously, but still reminds one of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority want to focus on sick leave.
First, to apply budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of grace on private sector workers before they can take the leave.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of salary, that is, a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing on officials a day of absence without pay in case of sick leave (so far, they have no leave, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector) .
While these issues are being debated, the majority also put the issue of fraud on the table again, this time aimed at abuses of sick leave.
&quot;The controls are going to be considerably increased and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing fraud, they will have to reimburse the amounts,&quot; warned Xavier Bertrand speaking on RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly disproportionate to the reality of sickness fraud.
In fact, since 2002 there has been constant monitoring of this issue and various political offensives have been launched that, normally, have borne fruit.
The French do not get sick more than in the rest of Europe.
Let&#39;s take a close look at the national figures first.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), in 2006 more than 237 million euros were paid in benefits for sick leave.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, sick leave subsidies accounted for 5% of health spending in 2008, amounting to 11.3 billion euros.
Of this sum, 46% corresponds to maternity leave and work-related accidents, while 54% is related to sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6,200 million euros.
Consequently, 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed stated that they had not taken a single day of sick leave .
Another study, in this case by Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% of between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbors, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health and other reasons) ranged, in France, between 10% and 11% , compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud on sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
The fraud is quite limited in scope.
The reinforcement of the legislation, since 2002, has meant that the controls of sick leave of more than 45 days are systematic.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term absences were &quot;unjustified or too long&quot;, that is, 37,050 cases.
In the case of absences of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases were &quot;duly adapted or unjustified; a figure that, taking a total of 1.2 million as a starting point, amounts to 132,000.
Consequently, a total of 169,000 &quot;unjustified&quot; cases are reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
Certainly a negligible figure compared to, for example, black work.
According to the UMP deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between 9,000 and 15,000 million euros per year, that is, more than the total cost of subsidies for low and certainly considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece is going to need a new adjustment plan to straighten out its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared on Monday, November 14, before Parliament; He also added that the 100 days that have been granted to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve that goal.
&quot;In order to carry out efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new program of budgetary adjustment&quot;, declared the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence to Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the Eurozone Summit on October 27 will be the &quot;main task&quot; of the new government, since the country&#39;s permanence in the eurozone &quot;is at stake,&quot; he added.
Consequently, Papadémos has predicted that the country&#39;s public deficit will fall &quot;to around 9%&quot; of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
&quot;We will not vote in favor of new measures,&quot; he said during a meeting with deputies from his &quot;New Democracy&quot; party.
He indicated that he agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that would impede economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the loan of 8,000 million euros necessary without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A committee of experts affirms that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live in denial of death, according to Royal Society of Canada report
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just for cancer.
Canadian society lives denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take steps to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included the participation of six experts from various fields, including ethical, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government modify the Penal Code in such a way as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient considers this option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To start, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death.&quot;
Medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians wish to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded in Québec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospitals.
Regarding the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal government, which has already declared that it does not wish to modify the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offense, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offense has not led to a abuse of its application, that is, the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with persons who are not competent or who have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, affirmed yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
&quot;Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal.&quot;
&quot;Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal,&quot; explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia, since they believe that it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
Furthermore, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of the elderly or disabled have less value.
As for the people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed think that a process should not be initiated against them.
Regarding the maintenance or interruption of healthcare to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, among their recommendations they suggest that it be indicated in the Penal Code that the withdrawal of health care, if it has been legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offense.
The committee of experts also asks that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses care at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just for cancer.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian healthcare institutions, the committee calls that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations regarding the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has described the position of the experts who signed the report as &quot;extreme&quot;, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill patients.
&quot;This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide,&quot; says Deschamps, who yesterday consulted a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to prioritize personal autonomy over any other value in society.
Now, he adds that &quot;in society, there are labels and limitations.&quot;
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her &quot;strong opposition&quot; to the report&#39;s findings, which she called a &quot;manifesto in favor of euthanasia.&quot;
Margaret Somerville, who is also a member of the Royal Society of Canada, especially questions the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan urges President El Assad to step down from power
Damascus denounces a &quot;plot&quot;
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bachar El Asad demonstrated yesterday in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday the diplomatic pressure on the Syria of Bashar El Assad intensified, which, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a &quot;plot&quot; against the country.
Two days after the Arab League&#39;s suspension of Syria, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Syria&#39;s neighbors Turkey and Jordan have spoken out in favor of President Assad&#39;s relinquishment of power.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar El Assad to &quot;leave power&quot; in Syria, where forty civilians and members of the regime&#39;s forces have already died.
&quot;If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,&quot; said the king of Jordan, Syria&#39;s neighboring country, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that the mediation efforts that Turkey has been carrying out since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
&quot;Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them, will leave,&quot; he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country with respect to which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States welcomed the &quot;strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime.&quot;
&quot;The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly harsh tone&quot; regarding the crackdown in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces have already been killed in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) has announced.
Two other civilians have died &quot;during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar&quot; in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem, for his part, considers that the country is &quot;moving towards the end of the crisis.&quot;
In addition, he has reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its functions, which in his opinion constitutes &quot;a dangerous step&quot;.
Syria &quot;will not waver,&quot; he added, guaranteeing that &quot;the plots hatched against Syria will fail.&quot;
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a &quot;civil protection mechanism&quot; and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also expressed his support for the dispatch of UN observers to help protect civilians against the repression of the regime, which, in his opinion, is locked in &quot;paranoia&quot;.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to fine-tune the implementation of the exit plan from the crisis adopted on November 2, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
The Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, yesterday judged the decision of the Arab League as &quot;incorrect&quot;, while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan from the crisis, although he did not express his support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time to the markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and launch a program that will include &quot;sacrifices&quot; aimed at recovering the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner debated yesterday with the political parties and today met with the unions and the employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, made up of technocrats from outside Parliament.
&quot;Monti has spoken of a broad program with many sacrifices,&quot; said Francesco Nucara, a deputy from one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the designated Council President.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has stated that he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday to guarantee that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation, by Mr. Monti, of a limited list, undoubtedly a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
In &quot;democracy, there are precise deadlines&quot; to form a government and prepare its program, he stressed, adding that he is &quot;sure that the markets will be patient and understand.&quot;
His appointment by the President initially won the approval of the markets, but later concerns prevailed, particularly after an unforeseen drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should create a team primarily made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include &quot;politicians.&quot;
The new government should function until 2013, the date of the next legislative, he considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will obtain the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when in office, he will work with urgency in mind and with the goal of Italy &quot;regaining its leading role&quot; in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that &quot;even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change.&quot;
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of achieving a balanced budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for the adoption of new rigorous measures.
The Italian &quot;head of bosses&quot; Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on the mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, &quot;since a country that does not grow cannot respect the deficit requirements&quot;.
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a &quot;change of era&quot; for Italy after 17 years of &quot;Berlusconism&quot;; the &quot;professor&quot; symbolizes &quot;the challenge of seriousness&quot; and &quot;another Italy&quot;, according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to place some 200,000 million euros in government bonds before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and on other documents issued by said UN agency.
The IAEA expressed its &quot;grave concern&quot; last week about a &quot;possible military dimension&quot; of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, starting in the 1960s, in a Soviet military nuclear center in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds for explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of &quot;nanodiamonds&quot; in Kiev.
In 1995, the financial problems of his company led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Later, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are &quot;clear indications that Iran is developing&quot; a nuclear detonation system &quot;with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as reported by a State A member of the Agency, he worked for most of his career in said technology in the military nuclear program of his home country. &quot;
Crimes and offenses against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and offenses against Muslims have increased by about 50% between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI. Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has gone from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49%, compared to a rise of 13% in the case of acts of violence. against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and a global increase of 14% in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of &quot;hate crimes&quot; has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
&quot;After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that this type of crime and crime has increased again&quot;, highlighted the human rights organization Human Rights First, &quot;the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is especially significant&quot;, the organization added in a statement.
&quot;Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,&quot; adds an official of the organization, Paul Legendre.
&quot;The US government can and should work to end such abuses,&quot; he adds, considering that such efforts could include improving police reporting on &quot;hate crimes.&quot;
The &quot;hate crime&quot; in US federal law was inherited from the civil rights era.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and is more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter modified the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which makes its service a little more like that of Facebook.
A new tab &quot;activity&quot; and another one called &quot;name&quot; allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other &quot;Twittos&quot;, that is, of those Internet users whose messages (&quot;tweets&quot;) you follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow up on messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they qualify a message as a favorite, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested &quot;with a small percentage of users in August&quot; before being released to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctual operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from someone else, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s&#39;ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec a maniement plus comparable to celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the Internet, users have debated the interest of this innovation through &quot;tweets&quot; with different opinions.
&quot;It&#39;s useless, it&#39;s invasive, and it&#39;s too much like Facebook,&quot; writes @ jemb123.
&quot;The Activity function will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter feed,&quot; writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budgetary &quot;golden rule&quot; in the Constitution
The government of the great Social Democratic / Christian Democratic coalition that is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budgetary &quot;golden rule&quot; to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria&#39;s sovereign rating by part of credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure much higher than the maximum limit of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
&quot;If Austria&#39;s solvency were reduced by just one level, from AAA to AA +, we would have to pay an additional € 3 billion in interest every year,&quot; said Christian Democratic Deputy Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the member countries of the euro area on October 26: in it, the Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the &quot;German model&quot;, since Germany was the first European country to adopt this type of &quot;rule&quot;.
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease each year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal State should not exceed 0.35% of the GDP, while regional states, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, by 2020/2021, public debt is reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens a new exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again to mark the change if the yen continued to rise.
&quot;We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find that there is excessive volatility&quot; in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to reach levels close to the all-time highs that led to the intervention of the Japanese authorities on October 31.
That day, Tokyo sold yen for dollars in droves to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just hit a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been rising gradually since then, driven by purchases from investors who consider it a &quot;safe haven&quot; in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was quoted again on Tuesday below 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that caused the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at over 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the archipelago&#39;s exports, since it makes Made in Japan products more expensive and reduces the value of the income obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
&quot;Japan is struggling to rebuild&quot; after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), said Noda, who fears that the rise in the yen will cut the weak recovery in the bud.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the catastrophe.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect &quot;Japan&#39;s economic foundations&quot;.
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken &quot;the appropriate measures&quot;, implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Bills by five trillion yen (47 billion euros), raising the threshold of funds to 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros). dedicated to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the market with liquidity.
Euro zone:
the types grow, the bags falter
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to hurt European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weakest countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the stability of the euro zone, the European stock markets sink a little more in the negative zone on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 am, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% and stood at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
&quot;Given the new tensions over loan yields from the worst hit euro area states, equity markets around the world continue to yield some of their recent gains.&quot;
&quot;Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,&quot; explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, renewing the concerns of market auditors regarding Europe&#39;s ability to contain the debt crisis.
&quot;Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes fixed on Europe and the exchanges will continue to take place in a narrow range of variations, so that investors will not have evidence that the situation has stabilized&quot;, considers Mitsushige Akino, manager of funds at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $ 1.3570, a drop of 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s party, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that envisages, in particular, the option of a country in difficulty leaving the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish bonds at the same term offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the auditors.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on October 27 would be the &quot;main task&quot; of his Government.
Spain is in the sights of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in interest rates (&quot;spread&quot;) between the 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Awaiting growth figures for the euro area
From a statistical point of view, France registered economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, that is, a more favorable figure than the 0.3% forecast, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised down the figure for the second quarter, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Also, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has registered a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 am, after the European Commission warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energetic politics:
facts must be worth more than dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with in the light of short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is fitting that an electoral meeting is the time to reflect on such issues and the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if you study all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic evolution will mean a doubling of electricity demand before 2050, unless a huge part of the world&#39;s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to alleviate the growing scarcity of fossil resources to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the debate. ecological.
The Fukushima accident does not modify any of these parameters.
That is why Germany stands alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case neither in Belgium, which subjects theirs to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor in Switzerland, which only aims to build state-of-the-art plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, are determinedly moving forward with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant that was interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such a discourse.
The election of Berlin will mean an increase in the price of electricity, a greater dependence on energy due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the detrimental effects will be noticeable.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
European champion in the wind sector, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power unrealistic.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not express opposition in principle to this type of energy, polls show.
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 director jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Broadly export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and capable of creating non-relocatable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear power, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of the 6,000 million euros per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would commission an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when its manufacturer is expected to collapse?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, one must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva&#39;s development of solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a Safety Authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both the existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our highly professional teams are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, was produced under normal operating conditions; It did not cause consequences for people or the environment.
At Chernobyl, the accident was due to reactor design and inexcusable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of an unprecedented scope, which killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, just as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these advances and to a cooperation between the safety authorities, and the French and German operators and constructors, the EPR presents a design capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While it is being studied by all the electrical players who want to build a plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them free to assume leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate a debate so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subjected to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of &quot;country of rights Humans &quot;from France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made headlines, with the Interior Minister (see the May 23 newspaper Libération) proclaiming in the past that France &quot;does not need foreign talent, laborers or waiters.&quot;
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is a lot of consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the course by stating in 1976 that &quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with nearly two million migrant workers,&quot; while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France &quot;cannot take care of all the misery in the world&quot; in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande limits himself to including banalities, indicating that co-development will allow solving the &quot;problem of migration&quot;.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally profitable, but economically it is very expensive.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.) , there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and hurts employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that immigrants can replace national workers, particularly the low-skilled, by pushing for their wages to be lowered.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are rather complementary than substitutes for national workers and are mainly engaged in professions in sectors with a lack of employment.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the more skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for personnel.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon would have difficulties working in a country that has a lack of anesthetists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to positively influence the salaries and employment of nationals.
Taking the above into account, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows implies a long-term rise in real wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, contributing on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labor Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go find his missing growth points &quot;with his teeth.&quot;
Such teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the reverse effect.
Europe invented democracy, it only needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious commodity, but it is also a fragile one.
The European continent should be able to remember it since, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some perhaps believed that, for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon &quot;the Little&quot;, that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient by itself and can even become an &quot;instrument of oppression&quot;, as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot used to say.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinodia of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return to the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be reflected upon in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle currently have shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer advancing in a good way.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to need and in a haphazard manner.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a halt to the void of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to bring about blows, but rather a common, full-fledged, calm and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time on a European scale.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that bows to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, that the one that suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for popular sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investments.
Exiting the crisis will require decisions at the European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead to disaster.
Having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
So be it.
But to think about it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being experienced as such by citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new stalemate.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to &quot;make&quot; republicans.
The interest-motivated Revolution would not be enough.
This lesson still applies.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe on the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let&#39;s make Europeans.
&quot;Contactless&quot; chip cards are becoming more widespread
The world chip card show kicks off on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in world sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to calculations by the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which makes it possible to pay for joint transport or purchases simply by bringing the card to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units are expected) and represent around 10% of the world chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless sector.
Around 26 million Visa bank cards already have this function, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But large stores work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
To get into the upper gear, however, banks need to make them available to their customers.
&quot;There are two large French establishments that have committed to systematically disseminating in the future, among their customers, bank cards equipped with the contactless system&quot;, announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile phone payment
But it is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, essential to carry out transactions.
&quot;They are lagging behind.&quot;
&quot;But it should finally see a real boom next year.&quot;
&quot;We anticipate that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold in 2012 worldwide,&quot; explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
Credit agricole bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale has also affirmed yesterday that it is preparing the commercialization of an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris worries about the ties between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-suspected links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even stated that Algiers already &quot;has the certainty.&quot;
&quot;The way in which both organizations operate and the intelligence services reports show that they are cooperating,&quot; he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French in Niger last January would have resumed the catwalks.
Kidnapped from a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly caught the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who He is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
&quot;This is progress, but we should certainly wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.&quot;
&quot;But it is possible&quot;.
&quot;We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active,&quot; says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such &quot;supports&quot; had become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices in the same style as those used. by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has been pressing Abuja ever since to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long viewed the group as an enlightened community of little interest.
A quick hit
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in Hausa, &quot;Western education is a sin&quot;), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the North Muslim from Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants launch themselves into the fight against the impious central government.
These last ones are oriented in the first place to the churches, the bars, the administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
The Abuja reaction was, as is often the case, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 deaths were registered.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested while alive, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect is radicalized and abandons its fiefdoms in the north.
Last Christmas, he claimed responsibility for an attack that caused 80 deaths in Jos and, later, another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuja, in particular the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local United Nations headquarters becomes its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would span from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, worries all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and stated that he was willing to &quot;share all the information&quot;.
The world according to the republican candidates for the Presidency
In relation to China, with Iran, and with aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival each other in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
By listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think that is the case.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more loud statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
Slogans, often unfounded, spread about China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot; nomination, has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them &quot;for manipulating their currency,&quot; a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
It does not matter if that implies the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama&#39;s former Ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated view of foreign policy, nearly chokes on an attitude that &quot;overwhelms&quot; the emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama&#39;s current position).
But Huntsman, stuck deep in the soundings, remains inaudible.
Reagan style
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear program.
&quot;If I am elected, I will stop Iran,&quot; he boasted.
&quot;If Obama gets re-elected, they will have the bomb.&quot;
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed in his obligations to that partner.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second highest ranked candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing &quot;tries to develop nuclear capacity&quot;, apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that, for his part, he is willing to deploy the US military in Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston on the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of the &quot;boys&quot; from Iraq and on their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population judges in a rather positive way the balance of national security of Obama, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, it distrusts the military interventions that generate a sinking.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to resurrect his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have together turned the handwheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the network of Western Europe.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will reach Western Europe each year through a first stretch of 1,224 km that connects the Saint Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipe should be completed by the end of 2012 which will allow a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas to be supplied, that is, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube along the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion of this enormous work on time presents an air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding the overland route through third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: it will be more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to cut off access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a &quot;new German-Soviet pact&quot;, referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has obtained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the Europe of energy, since the project has created a gap between the Europeans of the east and the west.
Russia has managed, in just five years, to make successful its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, big gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
&quot;This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically,&quot; confirmed François Fillon during the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large contracts in the gas sector are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of Gazprom managers, numerous in Lubmin, at the gas arrival point.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it against ship anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
&quot;It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution,&quot; says Jens Müller, spokesman for the Nord Stream society.
Likewise, it was necessary to take extreme measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs about 242 Eiffel Towers and is not interrupted along its entire length: not by valves, not by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in the waters of Sweden, but those responsible for the project gave it up when they saw that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state company to establish itself permanently in the sea off their coast.
&quot;In the event of a breakdown, we will interrupt the gas flow in less than a minute,&quot; says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But builders consider a leak unlikely, as they have predicted joints that are expected to leak every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the gas pipeline is ensured by means of an underwater robot, towed by a ship, which performs external inspections, as well as by means of a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
Shaped like a cigar, it is inserted inside the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides precise data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without the need for any type of repair.
The gas circulation is ensured simply by pressure.
At the beginning it is 200 bars and at the exit it is 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint company, called Nord Stream, in charge of building and operating the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favorable.
Afterwards, Gazprom leased to said company, for a renewable period of 25 years, the entire gas transmission capacity.
&quot;You will pay Gazprom for the full capacity, regardless of how much gas is actually transported,&quot; says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has been carried out in 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and in 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7,400 million euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not outgrow their investment, as Gazprom bears the expense risk alone.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy shore planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back their taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its off-white sheets, as if aged by time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born ... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a designer but distinguished notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, at that time a consultant for the company, was in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover sidewalks.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
&quot;Moleskine has adapted to current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,&quot; says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
And it was successful.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far has been the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which initially had twelve workers, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the center of cities, and has been able to impose his identity.
&quot;We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the boom in emails,&quot; explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition &quot;Detour&quot; where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, it also released a leopard-print notebook on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, diaries, pens, computer cases ... The brand covers a wide range of media.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
The XV Week for the employment of the disabled starts today.
Despite a determined public policy, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is double the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
Discouraging?
&quot;No,&quot; says Éric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
&quot;The progress made over the last 15 years is considerable.
&quot;Back then, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
&quot;However, there is still a lot to do.&quot;
It is worth mentioning that the disabled unemployed continue to face numerous obstacles to accessing employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In other words, there are many issues that make it particularly difficult to return to work and that &quot;are the crux of the problem,&quot; says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
Also, there are those that are not mentioned; people&#39;s minds advance, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the Cité pointed out that the surveyed directors have &quot;a low level of knowledge about disabilities&quot;, with an &quot;over-representation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually handicapped.&quot;
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are very far from the goal of hiring 6% disabled workers, a goal that was set in a law of ... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, dating from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
&quot;Now we reach around 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, general director of Agefiph, the body in charge of collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: the number of establishments &quot;subject to this contribution&quot;, as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
&quot;The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has created great pressure for companies,&quot; explains Pierre Blanc.
&quot;But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, particularly among large groups.&quot;
According to the Ministry of Labor, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 workers have disabled employees in their workforce, compared to 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: &quot;A joy&quot;
About to face Los Bleus on Tuesday night (8:45 pm), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly match generates.
We will not dare to say that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made up.
Five months after his forward&#39;s gesture of resentment against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
&quot;I was very happy for Eden, for her progress and because she is Belgian.&quot;
&quot;I want to move forward,&quot; the Lille striker replied.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the selection, &quot;it is a set&quot;, it has been justified.
&quot;I am in Lille all year round, which does not apply to Belgium.
&quot;I have to position myself.&quot;
Summoned to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard is coming to Saint-Denis to finally &quot;shine&quot;.
Without forgetting the &quot;pleasure&quot;.
He has been cheering for the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
&quot;I&#39;ve always been his fan,&quot; he says.
Undoubtedly, this will especially reinforce the &quot;particular&quot; character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face &quot;Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),&quot; he recalls.
&quot;We just faced off recently.
&quot;Playing against them is always a joy.&quot;
With simplicity, Leekens has made reference to &quot;pride&quot;.
&quot;Pride&quot; for playing &quot;a gala match&quot;.
&quot;Pride&quot; also to see, as a &quot;neighbor&quot;, that France &quot;is once again a very high-level team&quot;, about a year after Knysna&#39;s trauma.
&quot;Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job,&quot; he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus towards ... Brazil, in 2014.
&quot;Our little Belgians are growing,&quot; he stressed.
&quot;We are building something; the players are ambitious, they are hungry.
&quot;They will be able to see it in the next matches.&quot; Including the game against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento&#39;s Portugal faces the second leg against Bosnia (10pm) with great optimism, to be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, both teams lacked realism.
&quot;When these 90 minutes are up, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.&quot;
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
You have no doubt; The Selecçao, which he has been running since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Considering the first leg (0-0), on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for over an hour, yes, but they couldn&#39;t score the valuable goal that would have given them peace of mind.
&quot;It&#39;s a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven&#39;t scored away from home.&quot;
But at home, in the bright Stadium of Light in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, before an audience that should be just as enthusiastic, even if it is clear that the match &quot;is very close&quot;, said an optimistic but Bento lucid.
&quot;We hope that the match is very close, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead,&quot; said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
&quot;We still have a 50% chance of participating in Euro 2012&quot;, has, however, relativized the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
Friday&#39;s draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, although they also need to score.
&quot;It is a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we have not scored away from home,&quot; laments Bento.
&quot;We are going to play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with great individual quality,&quot; he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to &quot;not give them time to think.&quot;
A good idea, as long as it is realistic this time.
