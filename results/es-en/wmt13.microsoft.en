A Republican strategy to hamper Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat voter fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and claims that voter fraud is less prevalent in the United States than the number of people dying from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 voter fraud cases in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in the same line, a majority of American governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that hindered the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 election, which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced during 2011 restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an ID with a photograph, as well as proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce periods of early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of counting, and withdraw their right to vote for citizens with criminal records.
Prior to the 2006 election, no American state required voters to present a photo ID.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
That's why republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack such an identity document.
But often, obtaining the required ID costs more than a hundred dollars.
Therefore, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people on low incomes.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the age of 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, voters who vote for Democratic candidates the most, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs that often vote Republican parties to use documents issued by those clubs.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to file such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit Hispanic voting.
It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers supported in 2011 certain laws that denies voter registration on the same day as counting in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to assist voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 made the registration rate for new voters fall in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that favored reducing the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, while the latter accounted for only 13% of the state's voters.
In the case of Hispanics, exactly the same thing happened.
These represent only 11% of voters, equivalent to 24% of citizens voting in advance.
However, white people, who make up 76% of the electorate, account for no more than 46% of citizens voting in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fervently opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this sense, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed at the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to say for sure whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: Getting tested or not?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes has erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to question men, already reluctant in themselves, as to whether or not screening tests should be done.
Get tested or not?
We've asked two specialists for advice.
Studies in the United States detected a high rate of contagion among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret this data and make strong recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed some mortality difference between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at age 12, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of metastasis if the screening test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. You should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not attack life in the long term, in which case rather active monitoring of the disease should be opted for.
Today many men who have been detected with cancer are not treated, as cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active monitoring of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer you treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that you take the test in any case.
But it's important to talk to your doctor to determine whether you should get tested or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle prescription to prevent cancer.
Despite research progress, adopting healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of developing the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we evaluate that about 10% of cancers are inherited.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesman André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
Fatness and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectal, esophagus, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular practice of lifelong physical activity protects against breast cancer," they add.
Feeding
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meats.
In large numbers, they escalate the risks of colorectal cancer.
Deli products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting may cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
At the moment, however, his investigations are inconclusive.
According to SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them found a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu stresses the importance of discussing each other's concerns and family history with his or her doctor.
"Doing the screening test doesn't cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
What's more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But it's not entirely clear to physicist that it's Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seems to confirm that it is, although more data is still missing to be completely secure.
Anyway, we assume it's Higgs, as the chances of getting it wrong seem slim. We'll see what it's all about.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break that rule and don't try too hard, because you'll end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also such a law: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" consisting, grossly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicist classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called fermions, who obey wisely at the beginning of Pauli.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to Berkeley Laboratories' the Particle Adventure website, which, by the way, is extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we will not talk about here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be in some way related.
These bosons, you could stress here, are not the exotic bugs we might believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or the "light particle" that acts as a "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we threw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force carrier" bosons.
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, that needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it it is necessary to reach extremely high energies, a bit as if it were an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide over the surface.
That's why it takes an immense particle accelerator like CERN's (the large hadron collider is a 27 km ring of circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't: a piece of paper, for example, will never keep itself glued to a fridge door.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have one mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
But what "can all these investigations" bring?" asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicist to scrutiny the differences between observations and MS predictions.
For their part, many fervently want them to meet, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, such as that it does not propose any explanation concerning gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (another ups!).
But we haven't found such differences in CERN so far.
Impact
The impact of such research on our day-to-day life is difficult to predict, but we do not think we are wrong to say that it will have none.
For them to see: in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution their work would provoke.
They trained the scientific applications, but that's all.
In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory device".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light catcher in 1969 in the course of his research on optics.
Although it was by no means his original intention, this getter now serves as an "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that we never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... | Le Devoir
In its Commission Dying in Dignity, Quebec recently disputed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon as a bill is prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Le Devoir tried to see you up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year break.
"I had been given five years to live, but I've been like this for seven," he says, a raisin, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, which he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Brave, he even comes to smile, to talk to strangers who dedicate attention to him, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The bravery of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to be cured by diarrhoea, it's humiliating," he confesses.
A few hours later, the team found remedy to that evil.
"Over the course of our lives we learn that a man pees standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Returning to his childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on a person's ability to accept that regression," he says.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the big moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center have cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "healing" care.
Ms. A.'s greatest fear, 89, is to die "conscious and drowned."
But the disease has made him discover his children.
"I have some good kids," he adds.
"I have no more desires left in this life," she says, before agreeing to have a mask placed on her to help her breathe.
And expect, in the coming days, one last visit from your son living in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, since we know we'll all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying is offered mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand.
Diabetics are no longer controlled for their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died over the course of the night.
This morning, your son finished his beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois center, the days go by without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man who savors his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, having tried everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 who are sick with cancer," worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent centre come from home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem with access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Grand Montréal home palliative care society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative lack in Quebec health care that causes many palliative care doctors to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is agreed.
"Recently," she says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in the ER in great pain without what's necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get the right care."
And at the same time, many oncologists are stubborn with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
The hopes of Héléne Richard's survival were already low when he left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the sick who claim to die thank their caregivers for not taking care of them in their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Home Palliative Care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of their death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the un relieved disease is going to have a chance of having that palliative sedation.
Sick people who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want to be relieved."
The conduct of this report has been made possible by a journalism grant from the Health Research Institutes of Canada.
Wide-ous real estate scandals in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fundraisers and Italian Mafia specialists count, day after day, what they know about a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters are part.
An "industry" that was too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's funny how the system is pulverized once we've hunted down the big media," ironizes Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former montreal police chief.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by an in-depth investigation into the embezzlements linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the liberal prime minister of that time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding and corruption between officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the ministry of transport would have saved a billion dollars in contracts," containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, hoping to be able to "demonstrate the ploys that exist behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government auditors, researchers and analysts.
This unit also operates in addition to the policemen of "the Marteau squad", who, since 2009, have made montreal's "sewer cartel" moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has carried out a serial record of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec City's third city.
Repeated bribes are suspected of being pocketed in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers from montreal's road network and italian-born entrepreneurs such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito have been formally charged.
The latter has caused shock in explaining to the committee the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a Mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montréal, Mayor Gérald Tremblay's party.
M. Zambito handed out money right-handed and sinister during the 2000s, awarding more than Can$88,000 (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals in power.
He also admitted to organising a collection of illegal funds for former liberal deputy prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained this perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from construction companies totaling $736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating bills by 30% to 40% for false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of deliberately blind-sighting a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected policies to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Riviare-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she opposed since 2010 the sale of municipal land acquired for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money
From the investigation that will eventually take place, she claims that she pulls "a thread to understand how the system works, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and catch the culprits."
He adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We're cleaning up the wounds, but it would take a clean investigative unit in Montreal and be very vigilant so that dubious practices don't happen again.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is uneasy above all because of the role of the ''elected politicians aware of the ploy'.
Estimating by 70% the proportion of dirty money that went to the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, ironizes: "I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebequés government proposes to limit party donations to $100, but that will not change the donation, he says, "as long as electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It called for a comprehensive review of the system of public procurement and party funding: "We cannot fall lower; going to the bottom of things, bravely, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I go from day to day by his side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything's going very fast in football.
But I don't get heated.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine preformation centre to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in leaps and bounds.
You will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
Recruits this summer are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know every workout is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it their all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
It's backed by denies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the equipment?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one like it in League 1 and it is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think he'll take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken away our position as leader.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we've qualified for the eighth round in style.
What is the objective of the club in this competition?
We're going to try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want, to begin with, finish the first of our league against Porto in order to receive the return of eighth rounds.
Can the PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that's not the case.
Economically, the PSG is dedicated to its means to ensure that this project is realized.
Wouldn't winning the Cup in League 1, as in the last season, be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we're going to invest all our efforts in taking that title of champions.
Last season we didn't get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We ended up with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think he'll be the good guy.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take him away.
Do you think the media expects more from the PSG?
It's normal for them to expect a lot from us if we think about what's been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we beat Troyes 4-0 at home, still encountering things to reproach us for is a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for the eighth round, and they too have invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well the previous season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's successes.
We'd better say we have an Zlatandependence.
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and scores a lot of goals.
He's here to prove he's the star of League 1.
And he's shown in every team he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What you've done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the France team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things there and I got reinforced.
Today I manage to play good matches in the national team.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the "bleus."
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and that is why today we have exemplary behavior.
What vision do you have of didier Deschamps' first month at the helm of the "bleus"?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the World Cup qualifying group.
The player is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the Euros.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the national team to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) on October 16 in Spain serve to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn't had a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing burdens between the parties.
Moreover, as is often the case in technologies, the political view is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from equal to equal.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The bitcoin price, having reached the top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before re-rounding the ten dollars today (quotes are censored on page bitcoincharts.com).
It's nothing impressive when compared to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) became interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual currency types such as "credits", used to advance a video game and that can be won by playing or can be purchased (and sometimes even redeemed).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange, a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both ledger depositors, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two electronic addresses in the form of an email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are contained in the public account book, which is broadcast throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through solving a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of interim central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a file hashing phase, that is, the transformation of a large file into a shorter and more unique numerical footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "chopping" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (plus zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the set chain of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit fraud, a user would want to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would be orphaned, as both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundredth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in deposit.
"The ruling used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, such as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, the "giant rebates" were launched.
"$30,000 has been changed," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come out cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to launch in shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of review of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to impose, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, if this currency succeeds.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to re-take possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished above all the Afghan peasants, who we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, these will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to the French credits, was done in order.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx in Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible breakthrough between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
His take control of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to safety.
Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants surpassed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old wijahideens, the current government and the current Taliban share a desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, taking over government land to resell them as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting on a par with huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They are discredited; most of them haven't fought.
People, as I hear in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
We will have to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including armed opposition, is eager for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish folletines presenting a modern world have big admirers across the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities wishing to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, suppressing the prime minister's post that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly in the context of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has re-established its services, fixed any reservoirs, and no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumors spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mining riches.
And that only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper ores from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, letting international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) excavenate the vast search site and remain there as the province's most important employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country on which imports and exports are heavily dependent, will also need to restore their normal relations.
French troops departed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' colleges, boys' colleges, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous work of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, sweet of obtaining local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased growing areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two million euros of military expenses?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very harsh in those valleys often more than 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civil aid, well controlled and that comes directly to them.
A Forceps Constitution in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole.
He caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And Egypt has been using a provisional text, several times amended, for almost two years, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial messs.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" and continues to "betray his word" and "trampl the law."
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that this is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis faster and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this resource has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either they vote on my text or I maintain the full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist for the most part, voted on the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not go to the call.
By mid-November, a little before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they believed they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, substitute members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
As you might expect, the articles voted on have been unanimous.
Commentators are also pleased that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent's clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the subject of all eyes, remains finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than an advertising ruse.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who is to confirm its conformity with sharia laws.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing that "people called to speak out are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy."
The liberals' fears are further increased by the fact that the next rector of that university would be considerably less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the marital state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But it acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, since the terms used mimic religious vocabulary.
"We refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might arise in the future would be the extent to which civil judges are competent to rule above all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted on yesterday has received much criticism that relates to the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers will argue that there are few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another point of contentious: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the revision of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor will prosecutions of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
They also expressed concerns regarding the text, which they consider liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy remains and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
Moreover, no article emphasizes the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to be on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are awaited by the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons to visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal font" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus' miracles: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the appeasement of the storm and the full nets.
In this very place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin for "Via Dolorosa").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretorio, where the trial took place, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the site of the crucifixion, the Stone of the Ation and the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built on the site where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the holiest place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their desires, which will then come true.
Take a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress was what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 a. C. for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And get there on their own, can only those who are dedicated to climbing.
Others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermón, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
Bus services are available from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
In one trip you won't be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It preserves the ancient Dead Sea Manuscripts or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases by Impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bath-museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Cesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops there.
Entry is free, and donations are not categorically accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, displays one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yoursed in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Bless you
Israel's three main tourist areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air is heated up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point of the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are brine that easily support even those who can't swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing muds and fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are preserved by the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it passed the famous sea route that linked Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets that bear the names of zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph therself.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not advisable to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to hequels (currently 1-3$,8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is fast tram and haifa is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travelling on any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transfer for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport disrupts your work.
But on Sunday morning, a new work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, excluding pork, seafood, scaleless fish and dishes combining milk and meat.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, great variety of sauces, faláfel, which are balls of ground chickpea, fruits and vegetables.
You don't see street dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that "walk to their liking" in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Purrs love crowded places and don't reject treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to the insurance, it goes out for $15 a day.
And renting a bike will come out for 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount exceeding 51% at the same rate in 2010, prior to the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While deputies and human rights defenders discuss the consequences of the law on compulsory examination, scammers who trade in "false" certificates have already appeared in the country
Every year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
They are mostly citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who have stayed home.
From 1 December a law enters into force, according to which each labour immigrant must take an examination to verify their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those intending to work in the service delivery sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to take the examination of the language, but also that of Russian history and that of the basics of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must even be confirmed in order to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens of countries where Russian is the official language are an exception.
The people who managed to obtain their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examination centres will be sponsored by the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the test in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 such centers are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the exam was supported by Deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the obligation of knowledge of the language bring to both Russians and immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of labour immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of your rights must be initiated before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are for immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, put a "paid journey" into a creepy, narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him consume for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they are promised one thing, but upon arrival they are deceived, deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages," confirms the Head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Tajikistan Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be mad, little boss!
In the meantime, however, many citizens of central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that not only do they not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also in their own language they write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to mention dressing them, wearing them and buying them what is necessary for the school.
As they reach adolescence, these kids venture to work at the first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as the law on language is concerned, rights defenders point to an important point.
Exams will be conducted only for immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be done quickly and for only a thousand and five hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry fake documents, we are not registered and extortion cases appear.
"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajikistan citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be false.
Several "false" certificates of language knowledge have already been seized by Federal Immigration Service officials.
Counterfeit documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they would not have been able to successfully pass the exam the first time longer to study the basic course of the language.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic action against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite small
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to implement the law more rigidly in relation to owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: Squeezing gunfire during wedding celebrations where luckily there were no casualties, and the massacre initiated by Mexican lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which Squeeze Seven People Lost Their Lives.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons, from 18 years to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the law on arms possession will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying "hard-handed policy."
An open letter has appeared on the network, the authors of which, representatives of various social shooter organizations, demand that such measures of "senseless strictness" be desisted.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, he told the BBC news service in Russia, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012 142 offences were committed with the use of firearms registered in interior bodies, compared to the total of 1168 crimes recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, in his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black market for weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of website accepting gun orders
The first, "army or military vestige", i.e. weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranets says.
The next type of "black weapon, " those stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are released from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditatedly arsonized to cover the fault," says an ex-military.
According to Baranets, gun manufacturers also put their grain of sand.
"Private weapons factories that are not competitive on the international market have now proliferated and distribute weapons underground to the black market, including Moscow," he says.
One more source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes handcrafted, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military man.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
Specialists analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological literature and publicly accessible data from portals whose subject matter revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market weapons have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to guns," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of cases are stolen during weapons production and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The dependent on one of the gun shops, who asked that his surname not be mentioned, says that weapons found by illegal diggers have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers head to military warehouses when they need a game.
Through some ensign, the supplier buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This one takes the gun to the city and sells it at 900 euros per unit with two chargers," he tells us
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan needs to be met, they make test purchases from illegal arms dealers," the clerk adds.
"Nice hotel in a great boutique"
The seller and buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me went to the "Begovaya" platform, where there would be a man who would take me to a "corner" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I found out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
There are vendors in the markets, but there we also have to get there, say "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell him that his daughter had dropped a tooth."
I can even get a couple of steel mittens through a trusted person.
He supplies them only to me too because he knows I'm not going to rat him out.
Novices look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranets tested himself in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article on this subject.
The schemes, in his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was "everything."
"I felt like I was in a luxury boutique," the military recalls.
The buyer, in the words of Baranets, is not offered cat for hare: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the woods, where we put a target.
"They give me a chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun fires well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal encounters are required for this.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertisement "Buy a gun or a machine gun."
There users place their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (preserved spelling).
"I buy TT gun. Moscow," laconically asks his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two-handed those who wish to purchase firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish towards bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia
military commentator and former military commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to let you know where the weapon is hidden," says the NGO press secretary "The Right to Arms," Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is placed, one runs out of weapons and is put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two-handed those who wish to purchase firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to bait, and then to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by mid-range chiefs.
According to official ministry statistics, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced by 7%, which is 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are put on strike.
Up to a quarter of American teens find their first jobs as ATMs at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against low wages paid at Walmart corporation supermarkets and restaurants in popular fast food chains such as "McDonald's," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and become in its early stages.
Protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to increasing the modest wages received by Walmart workers and fast food system workers, the goal of protest organizers is to create workers' unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday". That day, in the United States, the rebate that captured millions of people, and was sometimes accompanied by clashes, was looming.
That day, some Walmart corporation workers, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside unions and left-wing activists in the corporation's stores, whose products target modest and moderate-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those of larger supermarkets.
That's why many low-paid Walmart workers shop only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
In the words two critics, Walmart may afford to sell products at a very low price, in part because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as lack of forklifts or handheld scanners.
That "Black Friday" the participants of the demonstration demanded the increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who gets $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart places the pay rise on consumers' shoulders, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters say satisfied that the protest took place in only nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation.
"Black Friday" lasted in stores from 8pm on Thursday through midnight the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, stated in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post, that they left their job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than "another prying trick," organized by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the targets were not exactly the Walmart department store (which in this progressive city has no appreciation for them, and for that for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and then they don't even grant you sick leave and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, under federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants increase it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 an hour in New York.
Nobody earns less than them in this town.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it's incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers passed through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble into some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this wage, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a commentary whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them.
Protest participants, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, i.e. their current minimum wage should be doubled.
They also demanded that workers' unions be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing them from this right and punishing union activists with arguments and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to span the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is excessive staff turnover.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place midway through the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, which involved several local Democratic politicians, not even City Municipal Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says he's selling billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
Protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, for example from city mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support fast food workers to achieve fair wages and the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves."
As the New York Times described it, this has been the largest manifestation of its kind in American fast food history.
But it involved only a few hundred people, even not all of them were fast food service employees, where tens of thousands of people from New York worked.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, cheating on the brain isn't that easy"
The theme of augmented reality, so popular with fans of modern technologies, is lately perceived normally mainly through the prism of special glasses.
In early summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a moving model and then, in November, it became known that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge lab, Izadi Sharamom, it was diluted that for the company's scientists, the glasses already belonged to a later stage.
They are drawn to the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the purpose of studying your research group?
- We are dedicated to person-computer interaction, but we also try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has become trapped in the working stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with its finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, your Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and nowadays no Xbox sells without Kinect because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
The world must be freed from computing to ours, to the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it.
Then you can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, those silly virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you cannot be considered a panacea, it is pending to resolve the issue of privacy, since you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for device control in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, gestures were captured not by the device's camera, but by a wristband that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to recognize.
- I mean, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine may or may not do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Are you short of resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives algorithm designers more work.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and today's 30 fps movements are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
I would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact to make the frames per second more.
- And don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared ray emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible fretboard sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required number of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the location curvature of the cameras, and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands, it is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transmutable" when, based on a cloud platform, you could go from the glasses to the smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that's where your strength is (private things only you will be able to see them), but also your weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the film "Iron Man", but also to any mere mortal.
There's a problem with this idea that critics often point out: no tactile response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly geared towards bringing tangibility to these "images in the air". For example, interference from several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located gives a feeling similar to the one you feel if someone was blowing it in your fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wristbands that influence nerve finishes of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive the brain?
Make him think he feels what it looks like he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that you have to fight with for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that it goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like gyms), mobile platforms, as well as giant balloons.
For now, cheating on the brain isn't that easy, you still have to work for many years.
That's what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The entire city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilophos storytellers in St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg vanguardism from the late 1980s to the early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and lifts everyone up the mood.
Recently, he took his hands an organ and became the organ grinder of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, for his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around town dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, image makers and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little grey provokes aggression and agitation of uns good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you understand that you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of unofficial old artists was over, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I befriended artists of the new wave, with the after-1s on display in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I joined the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
- And all this came together in your Art Clinic... - For me it was important to meet in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds had to gather.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no renovations, there was a musical art club, a bohemian club, the bohemian house of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, remember the way Schnur brought the project to "Van Gogh's Ear".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wearing tight trousers, including the now fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the time of Hali-galivskih.
We hit Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There went our employees and regular clients.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the award was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but very unre educated.
- There is something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in which the current and the occurrence are clearly expressed.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, The Russian Museum in Clowns.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so painful and frightening.
But in clowns everything gets smeared and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and obligatory change of clothing.
Now one is followed by the clothes, oriented in the external, but not inside the person.
And, perhaps that person should not be given his hand, but spit in his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
- Recently we saw you in the role of urban organ grinder. - A cultured city must have such a hero.
Who better than me to be!
- Okay, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art should be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people grouped into herds, bohemians wanted one thing, the other simple ones.
Now they've all been divided into microcommunicities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov arrive by the thousands!
- You will see the abandoned ones, there works the sex-social sphere.
And to a cultural event go 300 people, 10 thousand will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When I was young, I made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint pictures.
I'm in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what is missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is one concept: a culture official.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When kings were the right everything was different, kings may not understand culture very well, but they knew it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed, because experts are needed at a higher level who properly evaluate them and make their way.
Subjective personal taste is now thriving.
The same thing Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land there.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural land and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is very sharp.
We have to make art fashionable, just like it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a st. Petersburg grant.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spaceship caravans with humans on board set out in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is asked: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says state astronomical institute chief researcher Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with flora.
Experiments with plants have been conducted half a century ago.
Four generations of orbiting-grown peas differed in nothing from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophiles.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops under weightlessness conditions.
We get a normal chick as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, it must stay on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the laboratory director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Finding no support, the chicks flipned randomly.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chicks didn't react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we got the chicks born, but then we quit because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev, about the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, only species of the same sex will travel in the bioatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats, who were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in bio-satellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years now.
The biggest risk was passed by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing about humanity is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it's after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of the flight into space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
There are few of us, astronauts are told who after long flights everything has done well, and a healthy generation has been growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even on orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
In conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child is his or her birth element.
The little amphibious men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to the water afterwards.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the time of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming instructor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, gravitation, the force of gravity, is necessary for women.
In weightlessness the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepit very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it will push you.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyakov asks hes this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress him in a special training suit, like adults.
You will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally unadaped person," envisages the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
Over time, however, this will be a reality, when humans on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their space-born children.
Head of NK: Inspection of the "Avarc" system has not found the politician guilty
In the area of public awards, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application is limping.
So says Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Office of Supreme Control (NK) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," he describes the current situation.
Joint checks by Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Necaas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "Avarc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the SDP (Civic Democratic Party) would not disturb businessmen with inspectors. So is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in any way and if it prohibits something, then neither the president of the government can prevent the action of the office that has an obligation to carry out such checks or demand obligations," Kala says.
At the meeting of the control committee at the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the common project between the Czech and German teams, which compared legislation on public awards in both countries.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started to carry out about two years ago.
Put simply: European legislation regularizes how public awards should be organised, followed by the legislation in force in each country and then by practice itself.
We have put it all together and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "stricter and more comprehensive", however, concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate ever stricter rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think the conclusions are?
Precisely common control of this kind could help us to stop investing efforts in the concreteness of laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The savings economy means getting a thing that's right at a reasonable price (which doesn't always mean the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not because we reduce the award limit, it means we're going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork", that those who want to look for system failures will be able to do so more easily than if the limits remained as high as now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public awards.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKo or is it organized in another way?
As for offices, such as the NK, the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors) operates there, with an organization similar to ours, with a school too, the only thing is that, where appropriate, it is structured somewhat differently, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The powers are also to some extent analgesi, however, as Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call state funds here.
Public funds, which are administered by regions and municipalities, there in Germany, are controlled in the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
Generally, I would not like to compare without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be accurately specified what is best.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of inspectors?
I sure don't, but, I repeat, I don't like to make these kinds of comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries we take as a model face a large number of problems.
If they didn't, it wouldn't be any use for them to collaborate with our office, would it?
As for the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of law on public awards mean to your Office? Does it in any way manifest its impact?
Given that the validity period of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been expressed in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex post checks, there is a need for some delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new tool of "detection of non-economic risks", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of the selection process and the like are rectified.
Do you consider the passage of this law to be beneficial or, rather, to be a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulations "harden" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already with the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each un respected law on public awards meant violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to harden the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal ruling, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this path takes us.
The prime minister recently stated that the SDP would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Avarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the .varc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in any way and, if it prohibits anything, then even the prime minister of government cannot prevent the office's action that has an obligation to carry out such checks and demand obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and we allow it," but you can't say we're going to do it like nothing.
In the law on public awards, the rules are quite strict as to how formal action should be taken. And that's how it should be to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer for not meeting formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice sheets, although they are mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are passable, in some caution should be exercised.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but featured ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will range from five to ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the lowlands the snow cover is thin.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region's road operations control center.
The R6 fast track and the world-class road in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be icy and slippery.
In addition, all second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, in some of them there are still sections with remnants of ice and tinged snow.
There is a need to increase attention on the road, especially in the highest areas.
Pardubice region and Hradec Králové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the tracks, the Direction of roads and highways reports on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frosts can occur in the vicinity of Lan-krouna, stí nad Orlicí, Poli-ky, Svitav or Vysokého Máta, and especially on the second and third class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains from Krkono-e to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of crowded snow in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Knsnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will be between clear and partly cloudy today, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range from three below zero to a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen region are passable today morning, although caution should be exercised and time-adapted.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frost, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent drop in temperatures, some tracks may also be covered in ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is clear from information from the region's road operations control centre.
The D5 motorway is passable almost unrestricted, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most world-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the pilsen and Tachov road area bordering Germany there may be stretches with ice sheets.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so in this case you also notice stretches with ice sheets.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on less-traveled tracks in the area of Aumava.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially desy snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Eervenohorské and on the road in the direction of Videlsk.
Road operators removed snow overnight; about three centimetres of snow accumulated on the road in the city, according to the road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are passable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the road of Uumper, there are snow debris.
Drivers at the port of Eervenohorské will encounter medium-desicced snow in the direction of Jeseník," a road management operator from 'uper to the 'TK' has today confirmed.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also came to the Jesenická and, after chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the tracks are passable without restrictions, in that of Aternberská drivers should drive with caution on the forest stretches, where the tracks are still wet.
Istí nad Labem Region and Liberec Region
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications in different sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Stí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures stay below zero, even in lower areas, so ice and snow obviously stay on the roadway. On the other hand, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
There have been no service complications from the mment.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of the city.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal overnight. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Adverse conditions have been announced on I/13, on the border between the region of Stí nad Labem and Liberec, since the general roads.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut off by the branches of the trees that had arched over the road with the weight of snow.
Iimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in just under a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of many other alarmist news we like to hold on to.
The tap tap group likes to make jokes about this rather and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state charity act that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar set out for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December at 21 hours, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we forged the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased in www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, titled "End of the World, Cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can it be heard at charity concerts?
Of course it is, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
It will be sung by all the performers at the same time at all three concerts.
The anthems will link with each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
He has written the lyrics to this song and plays the starring role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts...
We put all our efforts into participating in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and amused to work with us.
What will the money raised in the concerts go to against the end of the world?
To equipment for the studeo barrier-free educational center, which we completed in its sixth consecutive year with the tap civil association in Jedli.k.v ústav.
The students of the school in Jedlisekv ústav regularly receive the visit of teachers with those who carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make this possible.
In the context of the completion of the works in Jedlisekv ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert several groups and performers perform.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jisí Sucho will perform in Prague.
For more detailed information, you can www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan for any other similar "spectacular action" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Praske jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at Bohemian National Hall in New York and I, personally, taking advantage of the us being in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group made up of people with disabilities.
What is the logistics and organization of these trips like?
It's not as hard as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. ASA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which never ceases to amaze me.
Even in Moscow, where we came back from recently, everything came out without problems.
Thanks to the outings abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you come across so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is still not often that a person moves alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, to give preference to someone in a wheelchair by elevator, there it is not.
Luckily, a civil association has been created that strives to theopathize the problems of people with disabilities.
In what respects should we take an example of more developed countries?
There are many aspects in which we go behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to move on their own in public and to be able to go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it's not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap, we're a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, it will start to change everything for real.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I walked into Jedlisekv ústav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Láca Angelovia says, we got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, popularity hasn't come until these last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that we were quite helped by connecting with famous singers and also working actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen, is as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the aid of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something else can be done.
Show business is full of things that look like each other.
It makes sense, in its own way, that everything new is cautiously welcomed and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and those of us who must have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it is not only a breakthrough for them, but for the whole of society.
Did the fact that you're a demanding boss help, as a lot of people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many ways and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their heads in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria leaves them quickly.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
Currently the group The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the early 1998s?
Only one: Láca Angelovia.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't help it.
Whoever has the will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the long-awaited end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9:11 a.m.
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, fléda de Brno and Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconference to jointly sing the group's song The Tap Tap "End of the World, Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the resources needed to finance multifunctional equipment from the STUDEO barrier-free educational centre in Prague's Jedlisekv ústav, costing 25 million Czech crowns.
Concert admission costs CZK 400 and children up to 12 years old have free entry into the advance sale option in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
Poland was accepted as a twelfth esa member at last week's meeting of ministers from European Space Agency countries. It is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, Poland's path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in flights into space before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the conference of A. Eternfeld at the Astronomical Observatory in Warsaw at which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The young engineer's ideas (born 1905) left attendees indifferent and, years later, Aternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, he won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Award in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a major driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known around the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he named one of the craters on the hidden face of the moon.
As far back as 1925 a dresina was built in Poland and was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known either.
It is unclear whether the rocket would be used for the start of the dresin or for braking.
Information about this dresin is limited to that collected in the press of the time.
From 1933 on, Polish artillery began to engage in missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the research reached the stage of the practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by engineer Rohozi-ski appeared in the specialized press and the following year the studio "Rakieta - clumsy powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were aimed at the military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile technique projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine refers for the first time to society with four very extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
One of them, prof.M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
Artificial satellite projects had already been launched at the time and it was obvious that cosmic research was a future-proof discipline.
From the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM probe rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and was first released on October 10, 1958.
The rocket was 1,800 meters high, about 80 cm long and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 aerial testing of the two-stage RM-2 rockets was initiated in the desert of B.D.ów.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket under development was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to peak at 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for volume was 0.4 liters, on the Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum heyday in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, the first aerial tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were later built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the NATIONAL COMMITTEE of COSPAR two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the investigation of cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonuta after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the social traabajos law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
As a result, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies at the beginning of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with rampant financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour cost (wages) causes economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the importation of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for this "causes a drop" of the competitor's price in order to take over most of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and is thereby not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social spending of the state necessarily grows.
This whole situation leads to the total disinterest of employers for paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damages they have caused in their quest to make a profit.
The situation is universally so well known that there is no need to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and therefore attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own people regardless of social decline.
This is especially evident in changes in existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictate of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees in terms of labour rights.
The result is increasing poverty along with widening differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points for poor people in Germany that cannot be maintained with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of help is now at one million.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: employed persons on such low wages that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum essential to survive.
Such a scandal related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
Savings measures in virtually all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to invest with a lousy wage on the edge of society, in the hope that private investor capital will one day arrive in the country.
Is it necessary to wonder where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a small part of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media affirm to the fullest that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that leading the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy meddling in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence with its selfishness the political march and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favours, in legislation that is virtually reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: state ministries, in the absence of financial means, commission private legal companies, which are often linked to industry, to draft bills.
Such bills are then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that liberally oriented democracies are quickly in a situation like the one described by Appianians in their work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had long disintorated and administrations were for force."
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread without hindrance and people came to the polls with the vote worded beforehand." "there were no people of character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state spent eight months without consuls." "He began to be serious that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man." Although Appyanos thought of Pompeii, Caesar rose to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that today's society is based on inconsiderate individual profit preferences without regard to common interests.
Private capital is not, in essence, capable of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as that of the time, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the rampant liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal-style democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next blow.
The really devastating fact is that today's elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the law on public awards is not the solution; at least not in the long run.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the chaos lab.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose chorus reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are".
"If my children did not want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged as always.
One, on Israel's side, argues in favor of the right to self-defense and typecasts Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs, and strikes Israel out of a terrorist state.
I don't want to focus on who is guilty of the killings that are repeated periodically and who the victim is. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to find out who has been taking advantage of the tensions that have been creeping for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on whom or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In human history, the history of power struggles is at the front row.
In each age we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who steered their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that to this concentration of money and the power that this entails, it has not been possible to come in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don't know, but I don't brazen it): the Rothschilds.
You don't write much about them.
Naturally.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have important stakes in almost every central bank in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the iraq attack there were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia has contingent the central bank on the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Rothschilds' Bank of America central bank, began during the Civil War to print money and was killed in 1865 at the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the EDF for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their eagerness for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the Freek Albert Pike, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially from Britain, and the third intended to reduce the population of the earth by half a million to one billion people (such a number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and would not consume as much resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method by which the group of the richest families operates, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, it is sufficient to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis such as the 1907 crisis would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after the success of the first World War, shattered Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended suddenly and unjustifiably from a military and economic point of view, Germany's capitation (the wars to wipe out Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
In preparing the ground for World War II, they allowed bankers and politicians to create, in an covert way, a conflicting situation in the wake of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of impoverished masses. Subsequently, it was enough for them to serve the Germans the solution of the Fuhrer, which was strong and simple enough and pointed to culprits, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that had to represent and represented so well the function of the fifth column, which ignited the flame and provoked the outbreak of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and the first conflicts with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks were taking place on both sides.
World War II broke out: it's hard to know if Hitler pulled too much of the rope that international bankers had him tied to at first or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state into world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If international bankers were able to initiate it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a frontline victim, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Take, for example, how Israel's supporters and detractors are divided sharply.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Where does injustice engender injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of it all was the greed of some individuals and their eagerness for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its representatives, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does his best to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, considering that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz , where 20% of all world oil passes (the navigation corridor is only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light David Rockefeller's words in 1994 are now shown: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls his whole being.
"And it compels all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on their right hand or forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in front, who adds up the numbers of this monster.
The number dials the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo Movie: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of the manifestation of Islamist students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomas as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the US. The country that had sponsored its regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive perspective: throwing the shah overboard could not be allowed, since doing so jeopardized the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was subsequently further intensified by the failed attempt to forsoever release the hostages.
Imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after negotiating intervention by the Algerian government.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and ensuing against Iran.
Failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Director and actor Ben Affleck's film "Argo" is the subject of an episode of this story, which garred a small hit for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees of the building escaped.
After a complicated journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helping a covert story an extravagant point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew examining the location in the country for the filming of a sci-fi superproduction.
Gender mix
The plan that was developed by "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood collaboration.
To make the lie look truthful, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other hand, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example may be the Series Ocean's Eleven).
The film combines moods. On the one hand we found well-documented sequences of Tehran. The sequence of credits shows emblematic photographs from the time of events, which were reflected in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And besides, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the hallways of the office, over the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting is no longer the target of ironic commentary.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Goodbye Little, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which the action takes place in boston, where he was raised.
Similarly, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed old film directors above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck proves it in Argo, where Tehran "rolls" in Canada.
The best scenes from the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy takeover is impressive for its synoptic ability that, at the same time, transcends the emotion of bewilderment and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect on fictional scenes (the imposter team in Tehran's bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And he manages pretty well. Sometimes it adds something to reality: here everything doesn't come out so elegantly (the scene where the crisis lurks at Tehran Airport, the diversion of a call to America and the rampant search behind its runway become crazy).
Argo's weakness is the out of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are by no use the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic stroke, but it's a film that can be followed with moderate interest, valuing its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But it collapses, that's going to be hard.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services can be is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which each year presents a survey on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a quota of 40 per cent of women in management positions at large European companies," explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the survey organiser.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the European court's recent decision to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women have advantaged at better prices in life insurance because they objectively pose a lower risk.
"Other amazing ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher reported.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or the guideline shades the size of hen cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual ban on using the term "spread butter" or the removal of the classic bulb from shops has been criticized.
A quality banana must be 14 centimeters long.
The Union apparatus makes such decisions often under pressure from one or the other commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
Lobby interests were behind the request, for example, that higher quality bananas should be at least 14 centimetres long in the EU and could not have "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended themselves by saying that this only seeks to harmonise national standards which have not been homogenized to date, which only complicated their commercialization.
The rules on fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive leads to a waste of groceries.
The candidate to win the survey could be last year's US prescription that in inflatable balloons marketed it is mandatory to note that children under 8 years of age are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The US referred here to an American study that, when talking about toys, balloons are the leading cause of child death by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to the use of postbate bushes by children up to 14 years of age are also in force.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation on European officials: anyone with any official function in the EU cannot use the Macedonian name. In order not to hurt Greece's sensibility, we must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's requirement on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fines.
Survey organizers were also interested in paying to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application for subsidies.
These kinds of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We asked the European Union for compensation," then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas declared in the autumn of 2004.
He argued with the fact that in our country a lot of cereal was produced and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was ready to help the Czech Republic and organised a public competition for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Nomec (US-DEU). In particular, it is intended for the drafting of applications for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
Member States' guidelines are often critical, the EU's policy efforts and, more effective operation and development across the Union, rather deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to the experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which member states have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs also have the sensitive fibre, as well as other countries of the Union, to fight for the right to appellation of origin of their traditional products, even if our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the appellation of origin of the Requesón de Olomouc, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the nineteenth century, and was renamed "tuzemak".
Only products made from sugarcane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected appellations of origin of the EU, together with feta and gorgonzola cheeses known all over the world, the marzipan of the German city lubeck or Parma ham, there are already for example Karlovy Vary cookies, poho-elx carp and even the variety of hops of Atec.
As protected EU maras, you can be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and the wafers of Hosice v Podkrkono-í.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Mr. Senator, how did you come up with the office for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything were all right in our country, then I wouldn't apply.
But I can no longer bear to see how it is stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, taxes and retirement age are raised.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I'm now forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have of changing things is to run for senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after it has set out on its way to the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate election.
I later stated that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function; function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That's why I need as much influence as possible and the strongest mandate possible.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but that we trampl anyone who wants to initiate a change.
Add to this the media, which discredits you and confuses freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
It is said to me that I have bribed journalists or that I have been an adviser to Jií Paroubek.
Let's talk about his ideas.
He is presented to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership above twenty million.
To do so, the law must change.
As president you do not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group for the office of guidance to be recognized as self-employment, and we did it.
The problem is in politics: if someone arrives with a good proposal, either right or left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without match marriages or dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from every party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing or left-wing man?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me, whether it's a little left-wing or a little right-wing.
What matters to me is that we get ahead.
I don't care if someone's right-wing or left-wing, I want to bring people together.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSM or the SMO and, likewise, I will be against bad ideas.
He makes a joke when he says he's a populist.
But you're not proving it with what you're saying?
When you create a business plan for your business, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without parliament's support, all he has left is slogans.
And with that he cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address and talk to people, you will, for example, achieve criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to do their part to get it.
If elected president, there would be no problem organizing a live broadcast on television in which he would ask parliamentary party leaders to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for state politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character pointing to the disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Take, for example, the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I say I'm just an amateur, I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to look for allies.
I have just started in politics and try to get as much support as possible for my program.
I'm trying to get things right myself, but in case it doesn't work out, six years from now I'll leave it and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura's going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that with a person I do nothing, that is why I have visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they may be encouraged to run for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jansura, but she refused because she had a lot of work to do.
For my part, I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought to light fraud with light heating oils.
I showed up on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted for the establishment's representatives.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to bring about change.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I have not yet considered it because I do not have time for it, to check the unimpeachable past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have money.
I have no money for the campaign for the presidency, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 kronor.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about property statements, what's yours like?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land worth 25 million, a flat valued ten million, another floor valued at eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and an Akoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought evils and injustices.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to borrow?
In the campaign I have already put 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that there's not much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign with money out of my pocket.
The campaign's expenses essentially cover what I'm going to get as a senator's salary.
But I couldn't live on it. For example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 kronor per month.
If I wanted to only make money, then I wouldn't be running as a candidate.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As promised, I've partly given up my activities.
For example, my travel agency representative will become my replacement in the spring.
People would want me to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200, 000 and 400, 000, which I continue to win.
If I were president, then I'd quit business.

Architecture studio MVRDV shows that true adventures are not only in the lead - in the example of Spijkenisse's library and the newly completed "mountain of books"- 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and there's finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby who walks down the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a large company near the library, says, "In addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have internet, tablets and eBooks.
Nobody comes in for pleasure in those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory city at the gates of Rotterdam that is hardly worth a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honor of having come up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to general culture and to copy the seven fictitious bridges depicted on euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that's how policy makers decided there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, of the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun and cynical buildings, took the subject with his usual serenity and seemed to present the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked perplexed around him and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here it is, my proposal for spijkenisse's mountain of books, the so-called 'Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain rises in the intended location.
This is part of the revitalization project, complete with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and townhouse buildings.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
In this way, the small town devoid of history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather intuit a dairy power plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a quesera.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with their topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to encompass with the view, the annealed brick floor and elegant lampposts unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
As you look up, you can see the banks of the park, dogs and children playing football.
And books, books and more books everywhere.
"Usually the bookshelves are arranged along the facade and in the center opens a huge dark room that is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is turn the classic spatial configuration upside down and take the reading area out of the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves black shelves that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and railing at the same time.
Sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers more a day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse.
And this is how one day, on a Frisian farm, we come across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, a plastic fabric of a few millimetres thick has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a basis for holding crop roots.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and is then thrown away.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, until plates four centimeters thick were obtained.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mix of new car and sneakers.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the café you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it is hard to believe given its large glazed areas, this building is an exemplary project when it comes to ecology," Trouborst says.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge pyramid of glass, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden trusses located in the cross-sectional direction to the glass facade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is a thing of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
Similarly, traditional Chinese medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She describes the "Boekenberg" as Spijkenisse's "late soul."
The reason is that, on the occasion of the opening that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
This is intended to fill, for the moment, with the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete file; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows his book is part of the library.
Even if it's only there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a success in this discipline reigns that in specialized slang is known as "creating an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
No more young and uneducated you may be.
Finally a starting point to form your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in U.S.-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier in the week, Germany implied that it would vote against the proposal to grant Palestinian territories united Nations observer status.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I don't think it supports the American stance either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was about establishing a flight ban zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, that's right.
This is because it is currently reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not used to it.
I think they're still trying their part, but they've already started the path to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy specifically mean from a German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend different positions than those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other major powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken on the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason it must be careful not to alienate itself from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't give it so much importance since it's not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the U.S. by abstaining from voting in important decisions such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German stance enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps germany has managed to gain some respect.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
Instead, the U.S. has clearly been in favor of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the U.S. and many European nations?
There have always been these disparities due to American domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the real disparity of opinions does not really have the scale attributed to it.
Looking at relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the politics he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher er, but must drive things from their own position.
That's exactly what they're doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to take a European stance.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a dangerous subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or maybe you're still found it hard to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still has a harder time playing a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the lead player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This isn't easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
U.S. influence on European politics is shrinking more and more, but the EU is not at the moment covering that gap, so who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more leading role.
Even if you don't like it, if you find it unpleasant or if you make them an even more unpopular village, c'est la vie!

"Trademark Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren is also known.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name lies a name officially registered in China but which has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponymous do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it's not clear that they're going to be right.
"Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, which specializes in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Copycats simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet where he keeps seats from the Beijing brand office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that was also used as the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are department stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are otherwise. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word originates from the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
Chinese authorities don't feel guilty
"It's harmful to business, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The mark makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are million dollars, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year China is, in size, the third largest and fastest growing luxury goods market.
However, being able to annul registrations of dubious legality in trademark registration is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can be extended up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long since the name at the lawsuit had already become a "market reality."
"If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged his brand in China," Pattloch says.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphical elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that was recently absorbed by German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely initially used a white and blue logo that largely reminded BMW; the matter was addressed in court and Geely had to amend it.
Clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities don't feel guilty.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they have struggled due to a shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the workplace emergency is back to normal."
In this way, the number of unprocessing claim processes has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, up 75% from the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As is often customary in China, the numbers are surprising.
Last year, CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark applications, nearly a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, the brand office notes.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure amounting to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been pocketed in rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as evidenced by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting a Chinese impersonator in court.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation auto parts,
the imitator has managed to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the ammunition appeal.
In the next two instances they have given Freudenberg the reason, but the opposing party continues to fight today.
You have to be very careful
The case has now reached the gates of the High Court of Justice, where it remains pending resolution.
Wentzler hopes to be able to resolve the issue favourably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review files up to one hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "sum of six figures in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but was unsuccessful.
"This shows how much we care," Wentzler says.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
specifically whether imitators secure rights in un protected marks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer attempted to register the Freudenberg name for shoes and leather products in Germany.
The group has long since left this commercial area, however it managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what needs to be done is to "register also in China all that may be eligible for protection", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the topic can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, should Freudenberg lose the last round of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party licensing rights by his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us off the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
Heidelberg rehearses Imbongi choir and In Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a link capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start dancing: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heels and loafers look for the beat on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano) slowly begin to rise, swirling, getting in the way and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his box almost as he attempts to bring order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty singers, between the age of 23 and 69, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the house master.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a little-known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations PROGRAMME to Fight AIDS, there are approximately 34 million people living with the HIV virus worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found godparents in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover the school's tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storyteller" or "panegirista".
In this room no one can speak this Bantu language fluently, but singing does know.
For ten years this choir has rehearsed songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: Southern Africa.
8,733 kilometres away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeastern kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancies in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of The inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying at just over thirty years has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered this secluded population, but what they saw mostly were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the chances in a poor country are more than limited.
Initially it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since dealt professionally with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial STDs are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
The ladillas and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur most often in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the basis that at least four out of five cases of syphilis recorded in Germany originate from sexual contact between men.
For heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomes, human papillomavirus, thrush (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the age of 15 and 25.
In our country, human papillomavirus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its figure from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been descending since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were reported.
This is one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and are therefore not detected.
How can one be protected?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but they don't offer 100 percent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you change your sexual partner frequently.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for their performances throughout Germany, they raise a lot of money.
"In total we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the Zodwa Dlamini people herself, a confident and leadership woman manages the money sent from Germany.
It makes sure that orphans find good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
"Gogos", as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof to live on and make sure children come to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has managed to get many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite how clear this disease is across the country, it is not usually talked about openly.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and over-filled lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially un accepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of THE HIV virus in recent decades.
But it's also because of the countless temporarys who travel the country back and forth and take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get condoms for free, but these are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact."
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two to three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many at the southernmost end of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to shed a couple of tears from some other rabid border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small population barely appears on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is well known.
"Come to Esitjeni, that's where the light shines," says the locals.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms on Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the pace, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also ice water there, as is apparent from three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that an ice sheet has formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shade.
It seems that this one is at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water comes presumably from comets or, in high probability, from asteroids that in their day collided with Mercury.
No one links the ice find to the possibility of life on the planet, says messenger probe chief researcher Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Completely inadvertently for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes, and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
Occasionally they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: older stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult thing to recognize is the pink color of "newborn" stars.
This region of star formation, un romantically named by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This twisted image of a dying star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The doughnut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits into its extinguishing process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pléyades, a group of stars also known by the nickname "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Propeller Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to spectacular color.
This looming star could be captured in all its glory for the first time by the Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It's probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Swirl Galaxy.
Depending on the hues, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the hot heart of this stellar formation zone into three lobes.
In the constellation Ofiuco astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth the nuclei of two melting galaxies pounce towards each other to end up colliding irretrievably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it by the nickname Of Southern Grinder.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula located at 1,400 light-years is composed of dust particles whose size is ten to one hundred times smaller than that of dust particles that we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical and X-ray images made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a model moment for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This stellar formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, new stars also continually emerge; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there's still no dust, just gas.
Researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when hydrogen could be found in the universe.
Our window into the universe: the most important telescopes
It appears that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
His mirror, pictured, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
It allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capability is comparable to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) anyone who owns a computer can help, providing processing power.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 you are not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes to us by the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extra-oil planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that since the beginning of its mission, 1,235 candidates for planets had been located.
The image shows the latest preparations leading up to the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers start from the basis that there is ice at Mercury's south pole as well.
However, there is no reliable evidence, as the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
Radar measurements have been pointing to the existence of ice in Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is the case.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years

A fingerprint search in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great shudding through the winding road that passes next to wooded hills, flowing rivers and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it is in the Black Forest.
However, we are located in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few miles away.
Here live the "talyshi", a people of which not much is known, apart from that they perfectly dominate Persian and Azeri and that are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts architecture perhaps too solid designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fully fit into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the road from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate the two urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The country's astonishing wealth thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this secluded region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May for the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will hold the World's oldest People's Festival," says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the lives of eight dozen local talyshis who have surpassed 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son of his died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the sheep shepherd, the 168-year-old sheep shepherd, the museum.
However, there is no birth certificate certifying it.
And if we take into account that the documented older man lived 122 years old, it seems that the age of Ms. Mullmov is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive one more daughter at the age of 136.
Have you made a mistake then in your age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in pakistan's Hunza Valley, very elderly people also live," Scholz says, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; especially when there is no civil registry either.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik tend to reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of talyshis.
The museum's director, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich eating of talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom also drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
Or maybe it's the natural way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97, he is relatively young for what is stylized by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she tirelessly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of them became grandparents a long time ago.
Two young children also jump back and forth.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that serves in typical glasses with abombada shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long braids of dark blond hair that his son discovers proudly.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so I've never dropped it and maintained its color.
"I've never used a shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never been shopping at a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything returned to its channel when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
In Azerbaijan, however, the cult professed to the father figure of the nation, who runs his country as a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, at which point he ceded the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's gray son is right: "in our culture the elders are highly respected."
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this were not reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is immersed.
The future constitution, with sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president spared no time in pathos.
"We must overcome the transition.
And for that to happen is my responsibility, to the people and to God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
All of them, hopelessly plunged so far into a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily nullify the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his powers "in order to save the revolution."
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctoral degree from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of your power?
Indeed, the 234 articles, the approval of which has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly troubling.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does that mean by "principles"?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal leeway it has, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new article added suggests: in all sharia issues it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunni Islamism.
This does not have to be the case, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship, these courts served to exert a harsh crackdown on the opposition.
After the dictator fell, up to 11,000 civilians were being held in military prisons.
As set out in the draft, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
This is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
To be clear, it's nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead, another prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is unclear what an offense is and how it should be sanctioned.
Just as dubious is the formulation that prohibits "offending people"
Is a president's cartoon or a joke about a lawyer enough?
A matter of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Mursi for signature and which, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been closing ranks in the face of the superiority of Islamists for weeks.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir del Cario Square and vowed to make the Act fail before it could enter into force.
"The revolution is back and we will end up beating," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third on the presidential election lists.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the trash can of history."
Through Twitter he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy."
"When he summons the referendum, we'll go to his palace and overthrow him," says opponent Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in the Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration; just in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before Cairo University.
Many women covered in a veil and supporters of the Salafiistas took part in it to the cry of "the people demand the application of divine law."
They demanded Mursi "cleanse the country," while proclaiming"the Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi's supporters did not want to risk something like this happening.
The Muslim brothers stated that both those who oppose the draft constitution and the supporters of the constitution would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now it would have been time to let the people decide at the polls which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft Islamists is guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were being held in prison or faced trial during Mubarak's dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the term 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," he laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag."
Extending Mursi's powers to the three powers of the state caused this lawyer to resign himself.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it," Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against him.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiting a monster that you will not be able to control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: the most smelly fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living levels, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country is related to its greed for a very smelly fish?
Take a series of over-cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The scenery is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is left to ferment in water for, depending on how smelly you prefer, up to a year.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy of the most, so to speak, captivating.
"He eats raw and then drinks a glass of aquavit for a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk," who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from a drink important amounts of the drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," Havard says.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I'll try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near your nose, it's not bad; it's not much different from a sushi serving that's traveled a few miles by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, when poverty plagued Norway and when, before refrigeration existed, fish was stored during the autumn submerged in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken out and, evidently with the inactive senses due to alcohol, eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is increasing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive social services system.
A stream of people from Sweden, the old rival and even not too much richer than Norway, arrives in this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered important, an essential but rather smelly part of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you the fridge of 10 euros ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like it to do so.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who gunned down and murdered 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the July 22 event."
Norwegians have a hard time believing that in their peaceful country one of their own would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway's current wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, as she walks past trays of rakfisk and who, with her long blonde mane and amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, wise people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously; everything except a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn't have during the years leading up to the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk, " he adds with a scrambled laugh.
I'm in the snow queuing for something to eat; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is certainly something different and quite succulent to savor.
But at night, that smelly fish comes back.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held where diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A television has connected live with a presenter who wears a bow tie and who is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
Looks like the Eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There's laughter and applause.
A man falls off the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the fumes of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a rough start
As Mexico's incoming President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant discusses the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad today.
In a city that, in the best of circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts off several of the main roads leading to the city and which is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the nation's management.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
"I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal."
Before rubbing shoulders with the president of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his home state, that of Mexico.
A very populated and fast-growing state, surrounding the capital; Opinions about the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is remembered fondly.
Its residents credit it with the growth of on-site tourism and infrastructure construction.
To get to the city you can drive along one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and bumpy roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with its name at the entrance of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We hope that he will achieve real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of Mr. Peña Nieto's party, the PRI.
"Particularly when it comes to security and economics, we expect the interesting and real change our country so desperately needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was unbanked by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition's rating of the new president's lack of substance.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic state man and, above all, he's a person who can listen."
However, on the other side of the state, that's not the impression that a lot of people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under stretches of elevated highway is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called for intervention to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighborhoods and violence against women is particularly serious.
On a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juarez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he did not know how to address the problem of femicide while in office.
The most critical accuse his administration of turn a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to hold back tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I got home, it looked as if her body had been cleaned," Ms. Buendía recalls.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
As her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross reading a single word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says he has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me like I'm a gossipy old woman, a troublemaker, a quejica.
What they want is for one to simply accept what they say and shut up."
"But that can't be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to prioritize them during his tenure.
"I hope he's the same kind of president he was when he was governor," says PRI Olvera MP in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of Neza City's victims fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with Allegations of Bradley Manning's Abuse during his time in prison
The trial focuses on Manning's period at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now alleges he suffered while in military detention.
During the prosecution's interrogation of Manning in a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits by unit officers Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence's request that the case be dismissed since his imprisonment had been harsh and that this had already been sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of killing himself while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
WikiLeaks later posted the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein checked with Manning the forms officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico Military Prison, where he was imprisoned on a maximum detention course from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked Manning questions and written down his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had described the treatment given to him by the wardens as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facility in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any allegations of ill-treatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that visiting officials had discussed these issues and indicated to him that they would be dealt with, but that they did not record these issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after talking about the problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean that I hadn't mentioned any problems," Manning said.
Justice, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not reported the treatment she received during the January 2011 meeting with a council to examine the suicide intentions she had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime under which he was.
The military said they had placed him under this restrictive regime, which is one degree below that of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the General Staff to know that I was ok and (wanted) to stop being under injury prevention. to be able to enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday of his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that he once lost consciousness due to heat.
He said the fact that he wasn't allowed to know what was happening to him or what was going on in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning explained Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning claimed that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, unac company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed he always had a light coming from outside pointing at his eyes in his sleep.
He said if the wardens couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so he could turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint about Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about a plea she had made in Thursday's statement that, after being forced to sleep naked in her Quantico cell for a night, she was forced during a morning recount to stand unsymoutly in front of the wardens and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the recount.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced by the warden's order that he should drop the blanket he might have covered himself with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning claimed that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or flip flops to self-harm but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night his underwear, flip flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers are hopeful that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he went through during his time in prison and drastically reduce his sentence should he be convicted on the court-martial, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning convicted of misdemeanors and defend other allegations deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules of application to any detainee in maximum custody in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally provoking the publication of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information, and theft of property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
It asserts that many were forced to leave Mexico due to a lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; says they remember Mexicans from those difficult times
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans find themselves trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely gone down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Some posters indicated the path to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
Having grown up in Central California, all my life I've been called "Mexican."
It's about ethnic shorthand, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York describe themselves as "Italian."
I later decided on "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, shorthand or scripts weren't necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish. Well enough to handle me during an interview on this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a Native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and got in the foreign queue.
I thought about that time this week when Mexico's president-elect Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, it was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also looking forward to talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment it is as likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as he is adventurous to go to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trading bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of rancour.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think of centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them of it are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that entails the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the Mexican press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And Moctezuma's sons stand up to war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is what they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about a grudge?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for which the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, somewhere in our family tree, there was one person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who had the door of opportunity closed in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of study, coming from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendings and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican dream.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulders as if we were from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is this rubbing between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel like they're not part of either.
We love listening to Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexican.
Now, to complicate things even more, so I've learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how great it is to visit that country and pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
yes, right...
That's not going to happen.
There's too much grudge.
And, with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us aren't so sure it's a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, folks.
That's fair enough.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated much less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the useless and usual discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their former conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything shattered whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught up in the regional uproar.
Maybe this will make your fight even bloodier than before.
However, there is reason to think that his deadly severing situation could unrag.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 is maintained, this week's clashes have reinforced the falcons on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has been beaten good.
And despite killing some of its leaders and pressured Gaza's 1.7 million people into one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has been unable to wipe out Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could conclude that time plays in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resuscient regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced Hamas' cause. So has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Former Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia party dominates, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas's cousin brothers and their leaders rely more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as the protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel's hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, hamas has been put in place.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more peacefully... for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, partly thanks to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of a territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that, under international law, , be illegal.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even tougher group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why pamper these twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets just like their countrymen have done in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and hit them good if they raise their heads.
The hard wing may be imposed, although the Arab Spring could alter its calculations.
Even if Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the area's superpower will hardly help new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire bodes well and could us mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder room that will one day explode in Israel-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics worsen the situation as the Arab population increases.
Bloody missions against Gaza every two to three years to reject Hamas will pay a growing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains that of sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and Israel's transfer of territory for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to stop the entry of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented position to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the affair should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unste each other.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status of state at the UN.
Mr. Obama also plays an important role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he failed to present his own plan for peace.
Back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to devote his attention to him.
This attitude is a deplorable vision for the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Generic tobacco packaging law takes effect in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases look on green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
The australian tobacco and plain packaging law, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of brands with a wrapper of an olive green off, gruesome images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and babies sick with being children of smoking parents.
With the exception of different images and health warnings, the only difference between the title blocks, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed on a small font type.
It is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
Australia's federal government says the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating traits that make this habit glamorous.
Trust studies that show that if a person hasn't started smoking before the age of 26, there's a 99% chance they'll never do that.
"You can see that children, even from an early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related a crown logo to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering taking similar action.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would promote the black market for tobacco, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"Legislation will have serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Other people say your business has benefited from law enforcement.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, claimed that demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers to cover up unpleasant images of the boxes had soared almost from scratch two months ago, when british American, Tobacco Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a recusal to the law in Australia's Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha said Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was expecting more stock.
"It's a good deal for us."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social media among the demographic sector targeted by the plan.
Following a series of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising and sports sponsorship that force most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has gone online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you market tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, online space is the most compelling place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews of brands from "ordinary citizens" posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if it's just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has taken the trouble to make a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
Australian British American Tobacco said the industry is focused more on what new regulations mean than marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to recuse the new rules; these countries are asserting to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a ruling in mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held talks with other countries considering similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
In Australia many smokers are challenging.
"Photographs don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them."
"You take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the king of the pack in central Sydney, says uniform packs make it more difficult for him to place them on shelves.
"It usually took an hour to unrag a delivery; now it takes four," Yu says.
"The government should have banned tobacco altogether and then, that's it, okay, it's over and we close the store," he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get a little bored
During this year's Thanksgiving festivities, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free shops.
But more and more academics and child development experts are praising the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it is right that, both we and our children, get bored from time to time.
Getting bored forces the brain to look for interesting options and may foster creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we willingly accept boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But, we'll talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History", published in 2011 by Yale University Press, states, this is not the case.
"In fact, the story of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin on boredom dating back to the 1st century AD.C.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways," says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and raising the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wishing, but not being able to, participate in an activity that fills you."
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that while they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to have it.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person who read a magazine article.
Some groups listened in the adjoining room to a full-volume television show that had no relationship, others listened to it at low volume, so that it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the show at low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; they struggled to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, attention disruption can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and one of the study's authors.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like spoting defective parts in a manufacturing line, distracting music can help you not get bored."
"In fact, we currently know that moving or scribble, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it by making that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people have a tendency to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a "scale of the tendency to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes issues like "a lot of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I don't have time to do it all."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in contacting 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he did know was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest heights," largely because both children and teens are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, going back to my question from the beginning: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to be exposed to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into substance use as a method of combating it, as evidenced by research.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the brain's way of telling you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's right.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar or cook, that'll satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long run.
"So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may no longer get bored, but he won't have learned to entertain himself or dose," says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to dose applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but learns to better control himself in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing a desire to relate it to something worthwhile," he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when noise stops."
Colorado: no instruction book for new marijuana use law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community high school and footballer in southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one September day, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by the police.
Police found marijuana in the car and a time later Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and related items (misdemeanors each involved in a $100 fine) informing him of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize the holding of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor causes for drug possession depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of misdemeanors for marijuana possession are being overturned both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law has come into effect in the coming weeks.
But Colorado's most conservative district attorneys are committed to moving forward with open marijuana possession cases and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from suburban Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent recently authorized marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what's next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police at Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who handle regulations in Washington state are also circling the matter.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licenses; all before the deadline comes, December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in terms of regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no real precedent that serves as a model for us," he says.
Washington law, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to provide "adequate access" to authorized marijuana and its prohibition on conducting cannabis businesses within 300 metres of schools, parks, children's play areas or children's centers.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly created research group.
On November 21, Oates, Aurora's chief of police, emailed his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would stop bringing prosecutions for minor marijuana possession offenses to people over the age of 21 and that police would stop bringing charges against such crimes "with immediate effect."
Police chief Oates said they would enforce city regulations regulating marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug dealers and sellers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face possession charges of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those offenses that at the time they occurred were a crime," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Grand Junction Police, the county's largest city, no longer cites adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending possession.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time in continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing marijuana use for recreational use within the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state highlight a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier with district attorneys," says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents marijuana possession defendants and is a local spokesperson for the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
"They've spent so much time taking people to court that they can't really accept that it's legal yet," he said.
As the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become national testing cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still provides for consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization are hopeful that the Department of Justice will give in.
Although there have been some prominent arrests of patients and marijuana vendors for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales businesses to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"While drug enforcement officers may not throw doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores to operate for the sale of recreational marijuana, permitted by the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy worker for the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying for what the community voted for in the face of voting for what the state voted for."
A lot of questions arise about it.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed to oxford for being a Tory"
College students are not attacked for their views only now
I don't remember any time in my life when I haven't been dreaming about getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and older brother had been where I assumed it was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue a history degree, I had already packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and burst into tears.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard said I had given up because I didn't tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson jokingly announced that I had left because I was forced to drink in shelled cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my flamboyant name, or the fact that he came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, which in the cradle of the alleged illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative party.
You might wonder what that's about now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students are undergoing similar persecution.
Institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative party students is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them demanded the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (undergraduate student group) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often seriously set apart, personally attacked and treated as uns pleasant people" for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on their college's equal opportunity committee to make sure they can express their opinions freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and featuring the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
He showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver grip.
At other universities, Conservative students say they are treated as "heads of Turks" by introducing higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the University of Nottingham Conservative Party Association, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cherill, 19, OUCA's elected president, says JCR members' attitude toward people in the right center has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford, I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, she was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an "honoris causa" degree following cuts in higher education funding.
The atmosphere would have shaken any Stalinist with dread.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a taste of the bitterness that awaited me.
I discovered that the professors not only looked fat at the mockle of conservative college students, but were willing to participate in it.
The policy of the miners' strike, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the seminary's wooden halls.
The first one I attended French texts from the 18th century had to be translated into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt, " said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I didn't say one.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like sponge dough, knew how to expel bad bile.
"Are thatcherists refusing to learn French or are they simply fools?" he asked.
The other college kids laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," Pitt growled.
I returned to my room like a grief soul.
That night I sat alone at dinnertime in college; then I felt a slight pat on the back.
He was a sophomore named James who ran as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are, " he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They get in with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be Labour."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardly to disguise.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A freshman in Philosophy, Policy and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" asked one.
"They beat each other up, don't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the '60s.
Could you one day lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet people who thought like me only after dark?
Should I become a Labour player and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me presented themselves as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my college.
He was hated for being not only of the Conservative party, but also thatcher's adviser on foreign policy and one of the people who wrote him his speeches.
I was barely around.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and for his adherence to the Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here, " he said.
I began to move daily from Oxford to my parents' house in London, finding refuge in my more open metropolitan-minded family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he was studying there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world, " he said ruefully.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His sore eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
It would break my heart if you left it."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminary in which another professor of history had hinted, entirely seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "stupid old men."
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career in Oxford.
Back then my father wrote two columns a week in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked.
I was in huddled with fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left I packed up and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you called me a weak crybaby.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is all the more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only trained 14 prime ministers of the Conservative party but, to this day, hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized him during the opening of "Valentino: Master of Sewing", an apotheotic retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "maison" for the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmina point of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most hailed of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from humble dressmaker of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with being in love with royalty.
"At least they don't turn off their cigarette butts on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad," explains former "Heini" Thyssen, intimate with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, sporting a Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the dressmaker.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
There were twenty of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the apartment, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything looked and felt its spirit.
"Each of the guests was made to feel important and loved," recalls the "top model," which began working with him during Paris Haute Couture Week in 1995.
"It never goes out of style because his designs are works of art," he says.
Alcurnia Parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-reciprocated loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glamorous sixty-metre-long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade down the catwalk to see a dreamy "audience" who wears Valentino masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis , the costumes used by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg shine in that audience of mannequins.
Naty Abascal and the dressmaker, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trouser, a shirt, a gillette vest and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they have great light and they are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
As a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of wearing the age and occasion to be able to wear one of her evening gons.
Finally it was time in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Ligne.
It was a red suit, with a flying skirt, draped "corsage" and a word of honor neckline.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dressmaker's prom dresses with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that comes with it."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the dressmaker calls his seamstresses) to make that ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of haute couture of the late twentieth century, "the return of the clients of high society".
Obnezed for years with the elite's "savoir-Etre", Valentino is now his best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I've always been touched by its refinement, its calmness, its neat and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musing Museum of Orsay.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was spotless, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The toughest trade in the world: Kawah Ijen's human mules
For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano are playing life and health carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for which his work is hell and another who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 life-making miners taking sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to go down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from the Earth's bowels solidifies when it comes into contact with the air.
After plucking large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets that he carries on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to ascend at a tortoise pass, keeping the balance and warmly measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall off the cliff.
They know that any backspeo could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who took off years ago by the cliffs of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 euro cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
Once upstairs, they make their way through tourists who photograph them as circus monkeys and, carrying the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, never rather, its workers, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As usual is to carry 70 kilos, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three daily charges.
It takes three hours each and ends up ground, but allows you to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems like a misery for such inhumane effort, it's three times what I'd earn on the field.
"The jornal of the miners is very high here, where the collection of coffee is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros), clarifies the porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, her salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the cut was not as hard, but Anto has returned to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a compelling reason that, in Indonesia, is as blunt as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and is irritated by toxic gases
The 27-year-old Anto has been playing his ass at the Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already begun to bill him despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
You have asthma, breathe hard, cough constantly and your eyes become irritated by toxic gases fired by the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I'll work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur keeps staining at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater, rising with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 porters load sulphur baskets over their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its penguin benefits, the mining company has not machined sulphur extraction to save costs or supply any equipment to porters, who work on their own and to both the weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of camera surcharge that, together with the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for the beasts and not for the people," protests Madrusin, a strong 42-year-old porter who has been at the Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working "as much as he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, between the age of 18 and 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and spits out the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps miners in the thick columns coming out of the volcano, they are so hard that none complain of serious illnesses... beyond, of course, their usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, knee pains and shoulder sores, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Swinging the basket on his back, Unainik can now only carry 50 kilos at 53.
Every day, he and his companions pluck 15 tons of sulfur to the volcano, which three trucks transfer to Tamansari's warehouse, 18 kilometres away by a goat road through the undergrowth.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth wide, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the toughest trades in the world: the one made by the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore searches for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stresses and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, let's do our civic duty and create life!
It may seem implausible that these verses are part of a peppermint pill ad, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
Phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (bun) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hopeful that with the ad they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to keep people doing "their national duty."
This is purely internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that this was an issue we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it so lightly is the Singaporean government.
Spend $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents awards up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as a replenishment rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says it's due to a "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family," she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in soltería, and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy is about to dramatically increase immigration to cope with declining populations has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where xenophobia is barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore's governing party experienced its worst electoral outcome since independence.
Since the election, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest quotas and levies on foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs, and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has gone on to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoebox", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have areas of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there are concerns that they may promote a single-store lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, who were previously locked if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the center's financial district doesn't seem to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are putting it off," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But it's important to me to have my own money and time," says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans have the final say.
Private offline is private online
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is about the quality of private or "the realm of private life that has the right to protect from any intrusion".
What is private for a child under the age of 16?
How do you apply this definition in your daily life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by venting situations on the Internet that you probably wouldn't share offline?
theperiod interviewed five boys between the age of ten and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on a personal level, and "in the key and name of the user", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets wouldn't put them in a post," says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been accounting for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB I upload beautiful or game images.
I also entertain myself with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who's making a fool of themselves," she says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photographs of naked people, crimes, or humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to meet the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are related.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just upload them," he adds.
"Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to someone I recommended to a stranger.
Joseph's case, 14, is different.
The teen has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not to know 20 of the people added to his friends list.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, none have been insinuated to him or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If they pressed me or demanded me, I would just take them off my account," he acknowledges.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
"He never knew who he was," he says.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"It just gave him privacy."
Then explain a series of steps to set up your account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
If I don't like him or I'll make him want to.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, it should be understood that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the emergence of these sites the rules of the game changed," he says.
Porras points out that the academic Marc Prensky, master's degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Nativos y Inmigrantes Digitales, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He comments that the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite criterion on what it is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that."
"They're also selective when what matters most to them is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and teens privacy is through questions that make them reflect.
"Telling them not to do it doesn't work," he adds.
Porras then lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a picture of you like the one you posted about a friend?
You know what the others post about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they should act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"One off the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, it must still be on social media," he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school professor and educational consultant, says it is essential that parents read social media policies carefully.
By understanding each of the subsections they have solid foundations for talking to their children about the implications of opening an online account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guard, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers."
Unasur Summit ends without making the Lima Declaration public
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant representatives.
Efe repeatedly attempted to access the document signed at the Vi Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of unasur, but sources of Chancellery and Presidency initially pointed out that they would deliver it after the closure, but then stated that at some point it will be published on the Peruvian Government's website.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information circulated among reporters was provided by press spokespersons from some of the Unasur governments attending the appointment, though not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, causing the unrest of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was Humala's pronouncement, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III South American-Arab Countries Summit (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently required by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was also not disseminated.
The official ASPA website can confirm that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities endeavoured to ensure that transmission systems were secured for all journalists but fully limited the collection of information.
The summit also concluded with Chile and Peru's joint commitment to accept a ruling by the Hague Court that says a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will abide by and execute the sentence that defines the differences we are taking to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean pair.
"Chile has been, is and will remain a country respectful of international law, of the peaceful settlement of disputes, of treaties and of international courts," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the CIJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogota Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international tribunal, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the non-assistance of Brazil's presidents, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 following the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the event.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after the noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document reporting that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects among South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding residency agreements".
It reported that actions are being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-priced internet access in all corners of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (from Latin America) should not have a triumphal matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and glimpse a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the cross-cutting axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although it did not give greater details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to rejoin the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbors, was another issue highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos said before starting his participation in the regional event he hoped to meet with his pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute in a respectful manner following a ruling of the CIJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) you may have an encounter with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua is going to require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I look forward to telling you that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the take-over of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc's defense ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen defence dialogue and consensus in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay make up UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru has the pro-témpore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America Must Learn from Europe to Integrate Citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, declared to state-owned TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and other conflicts, "but are now practically a homeland."
In this regard, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by Unasur member countries.
"We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favor of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the premise of downgrading the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and considering those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who give chairs never commit to anything and instead we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding," Julian Assange said in reference to Ecuador's political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he is not sorry for that decision because he has not betrayed its principles, but has respected its "deep democratic and human rights values."
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and its process not respected."
He also criticized Swedish justice for requiring him to undergo interrogation on his territory for an alleged sexual offence when "Swedish law itself allows it to be carried out by videoconference, which could be done from Ecuador's embassy in London".
Correa said there is a risk of deteriorating Assange's physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," the Ecuadorian representative said.
What there is is is the danger of your physical and mental health deteriorating from being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
"That complicates anyone's health," he added.
Correa noted that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting a lifeguard that will allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and european legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the enclosing of WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word is not used in this case, but there have been ongoing conversations.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a number of procedures in different European instances," he said.
And he opined that "if Britain gives the safe conduct tomorrow this is over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation allows perfectly and as it has done in other cases, questions Mr Assange at ecuador's embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as an advocate of press freedom and said that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which undermine freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and wicked politicians but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this respect, it was welcomed that it was no longer these journalists "neither bankers nor hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and noted that if re-elected he will "deepen the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay vetoed at Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the agency "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and beatings clothed in legality" because it actually "shattered the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
Ecuador's President also considered the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua now the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
That failure is not abided by at the moment.
It's a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be processed extensively to overcome them and move on.
It also confided in a good conclusion of the maritime boundary dispute in the same court Peru and Chile and believed that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries undertake to accept a ruling however harsh".
In reference to the eventuality of the candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he noted that he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite harsh."
Correa said if he loses the February 2013 election, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador's, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My gun movement thought it was me who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
To win would be my last term in the presidency and from there we came out of public life.
If we lose the same way.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's new health treatment in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse in President Chavez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state today participated in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: Positive AIDS.
"It was as if I dropped a bomb," he said, recalling the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "softer," without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it; with such commitment that he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he had a cut."
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their illness, even many people arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient initiating treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," HCG's HIV Unit chief Jaime Andrade Villanueva said, referring that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of immune system involvement that patients present at the start of diagnosis, with a better expectation for non-drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
Simply put, this means that those who are diagnosed with HIV positive at age 25, under these terms "as long as you stay in control can live smoothly until age 75," the interviewee explained.
To size this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have been recorded through May this year; however, it is ensured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had drug desabasto the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their infection status, that is, late in the disease.
He gave a blunt fact: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses, and therefore all people who require it have to be screened massively."
His proposal includes specialists and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who came to be tested in a particular laboratory, only motivated because it had been done by a friend and, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AlDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'd better bust three times a week," they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take the medications.
To date, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active but co-responsible sex life, I take care of myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, within the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let them get tested, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like anyone else, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the battle motto for AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Large gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a Tapatio journalist who has assumed the cause around HIV.
And the biggest is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has indeed increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of one hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that today, still, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with sorna and value judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which teenagers do not want to be exposed, the communicator assured.
He proposed to reorient this ineffective cast; condoms aren't just behind the counters, and those hundred are in public bath dispatchers at the sites young people frequent.
It's not motivating promiscuity.
It's not even about paying them for the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking if there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration.
"That's not sexuality, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who already do a sexual activity," he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of contagions correspond to the sexual pathway, 6% to the bloodstream and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it in a registered case.
Ratified by a U.S. appeals court, a judgment that ignores the restructuring of The Vitro Group's debt achieved through a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario places a nefarious precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country with solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures in guarantee of survival of the signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, at the same time as international conventions.
On the practical ground, the backdrop to the sentence issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms helpless against the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the door to Mexico's leading glass manufacturer to go to the United States Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Appeals Court says the main proceeding is the commercial competition held in Mexico.
The first point would imply ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, to this end, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law was created, with the American Law Institute being placed as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment provides that without the intercompany vote, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial competition, the debts held with its parent company by Vitro's subsidiaries, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro's has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts under endorsed the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the Courts of the United States, that is, the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent vs. 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, Vitro blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 on the basis of the serious economic crisis facing the United States, beating the country's punches.
For the time being, the signing of the González Sada family will bring an appeal for reconsideration before the appeals court itself so that the vote reaches the plenary of the appeal, i.e. the five judges, since only three voted.
If this is not succeeded, Cerciorare's appeal requiring a review of the process by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice, will be claimed.
The serious thing about the case is that the court held a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing vitro's procedure under the Commercial Competitions Act, noting that vitro vented in adherence to the agreements signed by both countries to tie vitro with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country was in line with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: they hit Vitro and beat him to the country.
Balance Sheet
Sleeping for several months the complaints placed on the table by mexican aviation unions against the former company's former employee, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Union Association of Aviator Pilots has already found the bottleneck.
The instance led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission who is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General's Office of the Republic on an operation carried out by the employer to extract from the trust F/589 of Banco IXE, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación, 198 million pesos.
Resources would have been channeled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Manager.

Meeting at a forum at the University of the Caribbean on the weekend, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members in general of civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal center of sale and distribution for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a housing area to fit for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeast area to oppose the monumental moat that swept away part of protected areas and raises the mother of all amagos against the industry.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball Has Been My Life"
Trotamundos del baloncesto Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of the stool and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has it.
Before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was a minor player, a National Superior Basketball player, a BSN leader with the Bayamón Cowboys, or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I put on a lot of basketball hats throughout my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his wide trajectory, attest to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all, the ones he treasures most excitedly are the ones that recall his time in the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15, functioning as a co-being or proxy of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy championships since 1967, whether as a proxy, co-stationed or leader.
There were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships raced from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at the BSN.
From then on he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, told me, "I've got you a strong player, 6"7" tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Cowboys championship with Gausse was enjoyed, but already in the distance, because by 1988 it was already a federation command.
By that time he preferred to enjoy his performances and Mincy's in the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the 1989 Pre-Olympics in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth place and it must have been bronze had it not been for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play a second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup group the best National Team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a peel to the American team, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the World Cup.
Not only did that team repeat Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-playing players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youthful Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the suspended players for the mess of Pan American Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
What has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that was Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level like Piculín did.
And that's not counting his career in the different leagues he played.
Who has been the best Boricua leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of young people, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you have left to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, bureau officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.," in the television series "Dallas," in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious, manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the production house for "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the iconic role he liked best," the family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her wife in the original series and sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'll miss him terribly.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had drunk a lot for years.
In 1995 he was found with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," broadcast on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it she played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when she encounters an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971–72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful portray of the charmingly loathsome J.R. that led Hagman to his all-star star.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate anticipation around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risky in bookmakers.
He also helped give the series an audience record at the time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it in and made "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment show in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened to label her a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt insatiable with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), interned.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiated he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, on and off screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who were fortunate enough to meet and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
The recording of five of the episodes for the second season had already ended and a sixth was in process, the network reported.
There was immediately no pronouncement by Warner or TNT about how the series will handle Hagman's loss.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York stage in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought was going to hurt someone or affect them in any way," he told the Associate Press at the time.
After the liver transplant he became a promoter of organ donation and volunteered in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like "don't be afraid, it'll be a little awkward for a short time, but they're going to be fine."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
They start course that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion teacher Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the Maya Calendar's "long countdown" on December 21, to which many people have clinged as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of time believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you look at what's been going on in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember, bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he's not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last in history.
At Temple, Adjunct Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We look at why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
"I've tried to inform students about what's possible, probable, believable and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled only "The End of the World."
"We don't add '2012' to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin," students must study, generate projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the same night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was saturated in two hours," Restall said of his high-average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, claim that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old career student in Religion and Sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - let alone a teacher - said he believed in the expiration date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy and we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a senior at Temple, 21, and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise in these speculations.
"Elsewhere people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any courses on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end-of-the-world" parties.
"Maybe I'll call some friends to laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
