European inflation slipped in food
Accelerating inflation in the euro area is primarily due to rapid growth in the price of food products.
The price increase in the month of November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, registering - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - announced the Statistical Office of the Union based in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts only gave like probable a 3 percent - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the North American, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decrease, together with the rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, they would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB finds itself in trap 22: &quot;you have to negotiate&quot; on inflation so that it does not have to intervene on this issue later.
The inflation of 3.3 percent, registered in Germany, broke the record of twelve years; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation soared in the euro area as a result of skyrocketing food and energy prices.
Forward prices of wheat increased by 88 percent and the price of soybeans reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, with black gold reaching almost $ 100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, while for 2009 it will already decrease to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain around 3 percent in the next 3 or 4 months, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup foresees a government crisis
After a long stalemate, by early December support for the Young Democratic Alliance increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while Gallup never before experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of the socialists.
The difference in the case of the safe voters of the parties - due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters - would mean a support of more than two thirds (71 percent) compared to the support of a fifth for the Socialists ( 20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the limit necessary to have a parliamentary seat: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among safe voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous low point - it has never been so high, 41 percent of those who judged the country&#39;s economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believe that the situation it&#39;s pretty bad.
Families, after the more hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about the change in their own economic situation.
With regard to next year, the majority of the population expects the situation to deteriorate and only a tenth expect an improvement.
In the month of December, 71 percent of those consulted, a figure higher than any previous Gallup poll, estimated that the Prime Minister performs his duties badly rather than well.
13 percent of those consulted trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány a lot, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of those consulted.
54 percent of the population do not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Young Democrats Alliance.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks that it is possible to control the discontent experienced with the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the riots in October last year, 35 percent estimated that it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, currently this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority ( 33 percent) believe that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of those surveyed to the question on participation answered that they would surely participate and another 20 percent said that they are likely to participate.
By way of comparison, in &quot;a general election to be held this Sunday&quot; only 55 percent of the population would surely participate and another 15 percent believe their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters, there is no doubt about the result of the popular consultation.
74 percent of the population disapprove of the payment of study fees, 79 percent of the medical consultation service and 84 percent of the hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of study fees, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs gold trading triangle maintained the average price level increase of 16 percent, with the difference that this year the VAT was not increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs golden commercial triangle, but all hypermarkets grew well above one thousand HUF.
As in December of last year prices had already &quot;skyrocketed&quot; in food supermarkets, so there was no drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is evidently frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below HUF 9,000, today they cannot buy even for 10,000.
Napi&#39;s basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of 10,000 HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(In 2003 that basket cost HUF 6,800.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with the two-liter redeemable bottle was less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even at the price of the bottle, was only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan&#39;s basket it was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, compared to last year&#39;s Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18 percent the prices listed in Napi&#39;s basket.
Comparing the values of the most expensive basket last year with that of the cheapest basket this year, the difference was 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest last year and the most expensive this year it has been 21 percent.
Average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so that during Christmas last year the VAT increased in prices.
It was precisely this process that destroyed the trade, the supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the merchant poorly plans the speed of a product&#39;s circulation, he may lose a significant profit on the margin that matches the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of Napi&#39;s basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, that the most expensive was 1,720 HUF higher than the value registered in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, since the highest price so far has been HUF 1630 more than last year and the cheapest also increased to HUF 1284.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of basic consumer items grew more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Statistical Office: this office, in the case of some staple foods, registered a price increase of more than 30 percent in the 12-month interval.
So for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to Napi&#39;s basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, since in the price of this product, which was already quite expensive last year compared to the base, it was registered, in the worst case, only 10 percent price increase.
By all the indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, being able to impose the drastic price increase even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the golden commercial triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our collected experiences, the majority of consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy large quantities of all the products, taking preserved food by pallets.
In the morning of Wednesday, in the three stores large lines formed in front of the checkouts because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country the sales volumes are lower, numerous multinationals complain to the survey institutes because the income falls below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in that of household appliances.
In many hospitals you save with disinfectants
This year there have been several thousand infections in hospitals, caused in the first place by the improper application of antibiotics.
Hygiene circumstances prevailing in hospitals, overcrowded beds and overload of staff do not favor infection control - says the doctor-head of department of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many hospitals, savings are even made with disinfectants.
Not long ago an infection with MRSA was diagnosed in the trauma department of the János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of bacteria resistant to antibiotics was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A person injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient shortly after had to return to the hospital as a result of infection with MRSA and since then it has not been possible to perform a major surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacteria in his body. .
As of December 10 of this year, 1,094 cases of hospital infection caused by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System - said Karolina Böröcz, physician-department head of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that hospitals have surely registered this number of infections caused by multi-resistant agents, there is no information on the rest.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, that is, Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One third of human beings carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing any illness.
SA infections (eg, sore throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once antibiotics are overly or improperly applied, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics become highly antibiotic resistant bacteria and spread rapidly under inappropriate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, for example wound infections or septicemia in the first place in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, in patients with a weakened organism, in the elderly or in people of little weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are common in hospitals.
Infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic resistant
&quot;These patients are isolated, the nursing staff treat them in rubber gloves and a mask and there are adequate antibiotics for their treatment&quot; - said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously screened for the presence of MRSA in their bodies, but even then infection cannot be prevented in all cases.
It is not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of formation and contagion with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate those with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This fact is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So that most cases come to light when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient - said the doctor-head of the department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes strict mandates for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological conditions.
It is necessary to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, that is, microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent resistance against drugs, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in the case of ambulatory patients or in basic care - stated Karolina Böröcz.
You save with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is spread from patient to patient through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, however, in this sense too, considerable shortcomings are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is spread through droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
What&#39;s more, hospital wards are often overcrowded, beds are often too close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals with less favorable economic conditions, disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability of infection.
In Karolina Böröcz&#39;s opinion, where appropriate prevention measures are followed, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
Treating MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, which is why it is being fought in all countries.
In England for example there is a government program to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The program appears to be successful, based on the data provided, MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and that of hospital infections that are due to these pathogens.
Negative breathalyzer test of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by the commander of the XXII district police.
The possibility that he was driving drunk or in a dazed state can be excluded from the since resigned commander of the XXII district police, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a passerby - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman for the General Prosecutor&#39;s Office of the Capital , after having prepared the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary breathalyzer control, which had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before getting behind the wheel.
The then chief of the XXII district police station, on Tuesday with his private vehicle when turning onto Kossuth Lajos street in the XXII district he ran over a 55-year-old man, who was trying to cross the street, but not in the designated area. for pedestrians.
(This last fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not extenuating circumstances, the driver must always yield when turning.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
Due to what happened, the district police leader resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Budapest Investigation Prosecutor&#39;s Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
400 million euros more for infrastructures
The Hungarian Minister of Finance János Veres and the Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit limit agreements for a total value of 400 million euros on Friday in Budapest to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructures , as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of 300 million euros to finance in the Hungarian budget transport and environmental protection projects, which will be made from the subsidy of cohesion funds, of which The parties had previously signed a credit agreement for a value of 100 million, the contract that they have just signed refers to the use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The loan agreement of 150 million euros is also used to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of 300 million euros for this objective of Hungary, on the use of the remaining 150 million euros the decision will be taken later, when extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will use mainly for the innovation and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the conversations they also covered the issue of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
An agreement was reached that by the time Hungary finalizes with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will return to discuss the issue of whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do it.
According to János Veres, this could take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth € 8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is adjusted to the EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charging a commission for keeping the loan at the disposal of the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian property market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that previously little mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and by whom are they buying on the even cheaper EU market, which will quickly become more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re / Max division.
The preferred target for property acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments on the ski slopes and villas on the beaches.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches of Albena, the &quot;Costa Dorada&quot;, the &quot;Costa del Sol&quot;, the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re / Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central part of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of property developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
In the same way, the capital Sofia may be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a quick return on investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being able to be a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example around Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also making an effort to change their life and way of living.
Most of the clients are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian clients on the beaches of the Black Sea and in ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re / Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They demand good communication and access, and for them the proximity of a big city, shops and generally a local doctor is important.
The second category is the buyers of villas (Bulgaria in December was included in the top 10 holiday destinations for Germans).
The third group is real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of the capital&#39;s real estate is constantly growing, since the demand is increasing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest property prices in the European Union, in the last five years these have suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in property prices considerably exceeds the growth of wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian six percent
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the meetings at the expert level will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration, negotiations will continue at the level of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world deliberate on the Bali Road Map that provides for efforts after the emission reduction period, established in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
Lively discussions on the subject are now taking place between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that for the moment it does not want to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to agree that compared to the situation in 1990, until 2020 the emission of gases will decrease by 25 to 40 percent. responsible for the greenhouse effect.
Another major theme of the conference is whether or not industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological help to countries that need it.
An agreement was also reached on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, foreseen in the Kyoto Protocol, will be directed by a board of directors composed of 16 members, probably within the Global Fund for the Environment of the UN (GEF) - writes the &quot;Piac és Profit&quot;.
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of the Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU&#39;s efforts to retain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister declared that the EU is committed to reducing its gas emissions by 20 percent by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the 1990 level, responsible for the greenhouse effect, regardless of whether or not the &quot;post-2012 agreement&quot; will be signed and is willing to commit to decreasing even 30 percent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 pledged to decrease by 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU member states pledged to meet an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary&#39;s commitment is to reduce the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect by 6 percent compared to the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will comply with - states the press release from the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali, since within two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed until after 2012. In this In this case, the reduction commitments assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system for reducing emissions, the need for which was noted in its most recent report by the IPCC, the UN international scientific association that deals with the climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
With this, the reduction of emissions would be delayed and an increase of more than 2o C in the average temperature of the Earth could not be prevented, a fact that according to scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) was the one that took advantage of YouTube services: the special units deployed in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban - reported the BBC.
These recordings made by mini-cameras mounted on the helmets are monitored at the Kandahar General Operations Corps, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been uploaded in this way to the Internet and their &quot;channel&quot; has already been seen by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of &quot;defense headquarters&quot; and publishes videos both of actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the Commonwealth Office and the forces Multinationals in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defense they also serve to introduce the public to the true objective of the British army&#39;s presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional television recruiting spots - defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for being of military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear on the distributor, for example about the death of soldiers: in &quot;official&quot; propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers speak at most of losses, without presenting, however, the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in actual operations have been uploaded to the Internet and from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British Army is only recently seizing this opportunity.
The Americans use a slightly different way of recruiting with the free downloadable shooting video games called America&#39;s Army, in which in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salty pastry at the Christmas party of the ministries
The Minister of Labor Mónika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a work meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with savory pastry and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate their party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with a raffle and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how power is amused.
Also the state offices are getting ready for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for Ministry workers.
On Orphans &#39;Christmas, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts and for Missionaries&#39; Christmas, relatives of soldiers who are currently serving missions abroad are invited. There will also be a reception for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the festive atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held at the Casa del Futuro, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and of the six hundred workers of the ministry, approximately three hundred and fifty are expected to attend.
A Christmas atmosphere will reign at the portfolio party, artists will also perform and there will be a raffle.
The ANF Christmas cost 4,700,000 HUF and was celebrated on Wednesday at the National Council for the Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party to be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Center for Economic Development with community funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we were unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of Lucia&#39;s day on December 7.
Their CNAJ did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister&#39;s words of greeting and after dinner there was live dance music.
Responding to the question from [origo] they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear a suit or evening dress.
Health, labor and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in their own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labor Mónika Lamperth does not wait for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a work meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty guests will participate, who - as reported by the press department - will have only coffee and a salty pastry, so the party will cost no more than 350,000 HUF.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai, on the other hand, will simply toast with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will celebrate a Christmas party in its own assembly hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget the reception with buffet and a toast will be paid.
Since János Veres is the minister, the MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the schedule of the afternoon of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year&#39;s reception on January 20, at the Ministry Christmas will not be celebrated.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the 100 guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple standing reception, to which only specialized diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These receptions, held every year, begin with a short greeting from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas parties - this is what the corresponding press departments communicated to [origo].
In the press department of the environment ministry they could not report on the budget for the Ministry&#39;s Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that more than four hundred people were invited to the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers&#39; Commissions will establish a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday&#39;s strike that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the work stoppage will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since the railway traffic will be completely stopped and until 1:00 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday that they will hold jointly with the National Federation of Workers&#39; Commissions.
Likewise, the strike commission of the LIGA and the National Union of Machinists will be constituted, which will coordinate the actions on Monday.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating unions will go on strike indefinitely, if an agreement is not reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report the date of the end of the strike.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call to strike.
Instead, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
Based on the Monday National Assembly agenda, it is also possible that the public health law will only be voted on late at night, or perhaps around midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will be significant transport difficulties: work on the railways will stop working indefinitely, in the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than the half of the intercity bus transport of the Volán companies.
Simultaneously, in many parts of the country there will be the closure of half of the highways.
Many unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League&#39;s website.
Some unions announced their strike for an indefinite period, others for a defined period.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railroad and the Free Union of Railroad Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are they travel on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1:00 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike, those of Budapest Airport from 7 to 9 in the morning, they will hold a four-hour strike the LIGA Unions of the Electrical and Thermal Energy Industry, the Educators Unions called for a strike of 2 and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association will strike a national strike at alternate hours and the Democratic Union of Workers in the Health and Social Sector (SDTSSS), which is part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal regarding public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new way of calculating pensions that will come into effect next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, in the case of advanced pensions, the possibility that deserving occupations can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Union of Railroad Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway lateral lines and awaits a different proposal.
Political Capital: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, established in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, from various points of view has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In the company&#39;s &quot;risk warning&quot; it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is constituted by the fact that &quot;with the worsening of ethnic tensions existing between the Roma and non-Roma population of Hungary Even in the short term, violent ethnic clashes may occur. &quot;
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They affirmed that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: &quot;the protagonists of public life ceded the public debate of the gypsy problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to substantiate his political strategy on the existing discrepancies between Gypsies and Hungarians &quot;.
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens the extremists and increases the probability of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, &quot;significantly deteriorated Hungary&#39;s image abroad, especially with regard to the stability and the democratic development of the country &quot;.
They remind us that: from the autumn of 2006 the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary received increasing publicity and impetus and that since the summer of 2007, numerous organizations that define themselves as &quot;associations of national self-defense &quot;.
&quot;The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while they openly proclaim the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is to say, the State &quot;- they add.
They affirmed: all this is produced in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of society with politics and with political parties.
Well, highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighborhood relations.
&quot;In recent months, in many neighboring states the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures from certain neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard. ,.
All this influences the political stability of the region &quot;- they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard functions in a similar way as, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the massive Roma riots that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to establish the guard, arguing that the objective of the organization is &quot;national self-defense.&quot;
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been &quot;gypsy terror&quot; in Bulgaria, however the State remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: This initiative has provoked a lively discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard so far has shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that also the gypsies of Hungary react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the Political Capital risks.
The director of research at Political Capital, Attila Juhász, when asked by the news agency, stated: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change in risk, they inform the public opinion, as happened in this case, by publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written in red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and it has already become a general practice that around the holidays - which will be less next year - the working hours are reorganized.
Even in the EU or North America the holidays are not unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holiday, state holiday and public holidays.
The festive days are mainly related to religious festivals and historical events.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, as well as the first day of the new year is a holiday - the latter especially so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written in red on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the 1848 revolution and on October 23, commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the State, on May 1 the labor festival, on November 1 and 2 we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country Easter, Pentecost and Christmas are two-day holidays.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays seldom coincide with a weekend, so there is often a bridge when there is only one working day before or after the holiday.
In exchange for the long weekends like this, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
It is the minister of labor that regulates in its specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or following the party.
This legal norm is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
On the other hand, it is not mandatory for companies and service institutions that, due to their function, work uninterruptedly even during festive days.
This year the work order may only be altered around the end of the year holidays: as of December 24, life in the country practically stops, since according to experiences, most people &quot;bridge&quot; during the holidays. days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their vacations during these days.
Next year several of our parties will coincide with the middle or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in the working hours than this year.
First, the agenda around the work party will be modified so that later, for four successive days, the workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2, will be a holiday.
The other change is related to the party on October 23: on Saturday, October 18, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year during the end of the year party you will be able to rest, since as of December 24 there will be no work almost anywhere, not even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little deterrents to embitter the lives of your colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, audible messages that we never receive, innocent lies that are passed to us without realizing it: they are all part of our &quot;daily Folklore at work.&quot;
You have to decide whether to adapt to small annoyances or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Tips.
$ excuse me, I forgot to let you know that they have looked for you from the marketing department &quot;- says one of your colleagues.&quot;
That&#39;s why you didn&#39;t go on a date?
In the best of cases, he is sorry and tries to fix the matter, maybe he calls the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to deliver the message (this is the less common solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved with an apology.
Before proceeding to embarrassing explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can embitter the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There is nothing more irritating than when you want to take a document, an office supply or your phone and you cannot find them.
Do you remember that yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but by this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your pen lost on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don&#39;t take anything away from your colleagues without asking, because they will rightly be mad at you for stealing their things.
Do not take envelopes or post-its from the office because they can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they sell out before the time.
Do you gossip about the private lives of your colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what is he doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Do not pass the information (guesses) you have about the private lives of your colleagues to everyone!
Don&#39;t abuse your colleague&#39;s trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even if others know about him.
Are you going on sick leave unjustifiably?
When you call the office on the phone and say that you are sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or good, you feel that you prefer to rest that day; think about how others should do your job, your unpostponable tasks, your work by term.
Don&#39;t bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you will have to stay at home, let them know, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to confront your absence the next day.
Humming, giggling, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but the giggles of your colleagues draw you out of it?
Have you unintentionally heard a phone conversation that it would have been better not to listen to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with your humming, singing, loud conversations (except when you do them above their head), kicking, constant profanity, expressing your discontent out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if you&#39;re not digging into a project right now (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don&#39;t blame others if you didn&#39;t finish something on time, forgot to send an important letter or message!
Do not refer to the chaos that may eventually reign in the office, or to the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers - very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don&#39;t wear a comfortable jogging suit even if your occupation allows it!
Do not be unkempt, respect yourself and your colleagues by wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation requires it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the public&#39;s expectations
The car crawls through the usual morning traffic jam.
A strange compass is playing on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
Turn up the volume.
The rhythm of the music changes and the previous tones are added the bass and then the voice of a female choir like a real jewel intervenes.
Channel mr2 plays Zagar&#39;s song Wings of Love.
The national musical life did not spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jam seems totally different when you&#39;re listening to Zagar&#39;s new album.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs from the national digital underground are gradually changing the image and although garage-style rock is back in fashion, breaks guitars, national electro pop has shown: there is news under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, he played in the Yonderboi group until he began his independent career, perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same group.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when they asked him for film soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The larger public became acquainted with the ensemble that initially performed only in small clubs when wan2 magazine selected their first album released in 2002 among the top fifty national albums, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi, as almost the only national trend setter. , able to be sold also in western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his outfit are in fashion, but no one has asked them whether or not they willingly wear this label.
The group reacted as it should react: they prepared a new and even better album.
The newly released album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, may open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
Well, this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zságer.
The reference to the airy, to the flight is fine, but in addition to the airyness of the music, now the loudest-sounding guitar, the rock and roll effect, appeared - in keeping with the spirit and trend of the time.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the group The Puzzle.
The album includes a real hit from the mr2 Petõfi channel, which lately broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This station brought the top-flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers ($ ivas Underground &quot;), to listeners&#39; ears.
Well, everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: the one you are interpreting, to what extent is it a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of a select public means little to me.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can also be composed only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But a good pop song can also come from sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There, not only the generations of fifteen and twenty attend the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good seeing that more and more people are attending our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for any purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi&#39;s example?
He works solo and made his career more like the west of us.
B.Zs: We don&#39;t go his way, even though they sometimes try to compare our music to his.
Rather, we work as a team, we trust each other&#39;s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they would compare our work with Yonderboi&#39;s music, since many of us started our careers in his group and from there we took another path.
hvg.hu: On the mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love chart it is in the first place.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up with this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B .: We didn&#39;t intend to compose great hits and sell our album with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We add it to the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the album and the heavier songs.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea to create this choir of soloists with a good voice from our own national music scene.
This is how that choir of six women was created - that is, Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - which was later baptized as Divas de Underground.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly like this or did the girls change a few things?
Zs.B .: This song existed for a long time in an instrumental version and when we had all the material on the album, we thought that something was still missing.
The chord attracted the song.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came practically on the first try and incredibly spontaneous.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I also needed the Divas.
With my voice it would not have worked so strongly.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the album it seems as if the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except for the short Judy Jay solo), they have no role of their own, they all sing together and not louder than the music, so the music doesn&#39;t just accompany their songs.
Also on stage they are in the background.
Willfully?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead we consciously did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song is also about it, about forgetting our ego for a while, the one who, where did he come from and where he is going, let those wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I would have liked to make others feel that euphoric state of mind that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you do the most work?
Zs.B .: In the musical composition, really, none, rather when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example Dorian Gray&#39;s Dilemma in which I am playing on a concert piano or Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I did not want the groove to work and then, little by little everything fell into place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B .: This changes constantly with concerts and because I have already &quot;dropped&quot; the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
Treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A disloyal embezzler.
This is how he points to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banking giant of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Bank of Commerce.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, without a doubt, with good abilities.
He sensed long ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
&quot;He has a fragile character&quot; was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel&#39;s responses according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, reveal is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1,600 million euros thanks to to their businesses.
Crisis not only in America
&quot;All I wanted to do was earn money for my bank,&quot; he says in his answers.
Precisely, in summer, he managed to earn 500 million euros during the American crisis.
You already saw this opportunity coming at the beginning of the year.
In February some news began to be heard about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income clients or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those clients would begin to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn&#39;t buy it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their earnings exceeded 1,600 million euros.
&quot;When I already won my first 500 million I did not know how to notify it&quot; confesses Kerviel and adds, that he has not left anything for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even deceived the bosses, even as the Eurex Stock Exchange became interested in his business.
Risk turned into profit
Were you afraid it would be discovered?
Rather, no.
&quot;I thought I had made $ 1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy.&quot;
Where did he get so much willpower to take such risks?
In my position you had to work gradually.
He started working at Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary ranged from $ 51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant to a stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $ 90,000.
Still he knew that he was never going to win as much as the others.
&quot;In my first interview in 2005 I already observed that they were watching me with caution.
Due to my training and also my professional and personal progress, &quot;Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after I joined the company, the first big success came.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz, he won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing a title of 500 million euros down.
And this was a starter, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
&quot;This is like a snowball,&quot; said the police.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or that they rather suspected it.
&quot;While making money, they closed their eyes.&quot;
Only then came the coup earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all traces.
When he got to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5,000 million euros because of him.
And how did they manage to locate him?
He became a suspect after his vacation.
&quot;I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn&#39;t have a vacation is a runner who doesn&#39;t want anyone to take a look at his file, &quot;Kerviel finished.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
The ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programs from which the Czech Republic can get 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
This is practically half of the total sum that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately SEK 125 billion will come out of seven operational programs for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will go to transportation, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Program is the largest of the operational programs and represents up to 22 percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can get from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.800 million crowns.
The Business and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain financing for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
When it comes to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newcomers that use them the least.
Twenty-year sentence for the former president of Nicaragua, the court decreed
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday decreed a 20-year sentence for the country&#39;s former president, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 for embezzlement of 100 billion dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from jail to go to house arrest on his farm not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not at all clear at this time, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, will be behind bars again.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will rather be up to the prison officers if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how Alemán constantly transferred government money to a company account in Pánama.
This company was fictitious and the account actually belonged to his closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that Alemán created to finance his campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how they approved the budget
So is.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drawn up by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year&#39;s budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, calmly approved the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and item of the budget, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics, but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they pay special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than mere numbers.
The State Budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three defects that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of them is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as expenses of the leaders, which are not only pensions but also social benefits that were already approved last year before the elections by the &quot;silent&quot; ČSSD coalition and KSČM.
The second of them is the deficit in the economy as a consequence of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public financing, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not found in the deficit of the State Budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors, in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from money from taxes, fees, and credits from banks, often meaninglessly issued bonds with which they disproportionately indebted their municipalities.
In recent years, they managed to pay off these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks that they received from the state and privatization.
They currently do not have this resource.
If we stick only to the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, for a few years now, goes through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of which ČSSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put the state finances in order.
Instead, however, the state continued to borrow.
The rest of the countries, except some like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, on the previous government.
We belong to the nations that, within global measures, are less threatened by poverty.
That is why massive social programs are not necessary, which, unfortunately, in recent years have been uselessly swollen with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate part of the incomprehensible populist expenditures approved this year before the elections, if the retirement age and the pension reform do not change shortly then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, whoever governs alone, governs it will be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a bit, we can say that the politicians who govern will be transformed into civil servants, mechanical distributors of most of the money from taxes for retirement and social benefits.
For this reason, this year&#39;s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal expenses from the expenses of the leaders.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for the year 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not squandered in the last ten years what they could.
We do not want the politicians who govern to become only officials so we must be patient and concede to this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to obtain from taxes and fees, the tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will make possible the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
In the Monetary Marking, more than one hundred billion dollars will be received through bids.
In these tenders, banks auction the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send forty billion dollars to tender, and then another twenty-four billion dollars will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and lessen the consequences of the financial crisis.
&quot;This step should solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continuing growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend,&quot; Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to clients.
&quot;This coordinated action by central banks probably slowed the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,&quot; Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $ 60 billion on bad loans, mostly in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
&quot;Central banks must really be afraid of what lies ahead when they decided to take this step,&quot; said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
&quot;It seems that the situation is really bad,&quot; he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems of access to loans and that for this reason they will have to lend more expensively to their clients.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to lend money on the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid of borrowing money even as central banks in the US, Canada and Great Britain cut their interest rates several times in the fall.
&quot;It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates,&quot; Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by the central banks contributes to igniting the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: The environmentalists&#39; debates are amazing
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke out again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now arose with the closing of the UN international conference on climate change, in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates by environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and the reality.
&quot;There the debates are hardly structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to current problems,&quot; said Klaus.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech president stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because as he said &quot;many times I only come across the caricature of my ideas&quot;.
Now those interested can find out about his diverse opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closing, he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement among scientists about global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious. , nor do they represent potential disasters and that attempts to influence climate development are futile, ineffective and costly unacceptable.
In addition, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
To the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that he is not against &quot;reasonable defenders of the environment but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits.&quot;
Klaus spoke about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people did not manage to change their driving license
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the date and therefore did not manage to change their old driving license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without a valid license.
According to traffic, the license has not been changed mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the towns they announce a rapid decline in the change of cards, the offices of the metropolis are full of requests and interest in the new card has increased.
The City Council estimates around 2,000 customers a day.
In the queues you wait half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet obtained the new license.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card in a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must necessarily change their license and do not reach the end of the year, but will hit the roads without a valid license will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The policeman can fix the infraction with a warning.
In the case of an administrative offense, the fine will amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could pay presumably up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices for moderate fines of a maximum of 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesperson of the transport ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of one thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driving license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who do not want to drive should hand over their driving license.
It is enough to bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driving licenses.
People with the document between the years 1994 to 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to Berdych&#39;s complicit detectives
Former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in jail.
The High Court of Prague decided as the final expiration the reduction of penalties, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives of the Prague department against organized crime were going to fall, initially, between 14 and 12 years.
Today&#39;s decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the Superior Court.
Berdych is also accused in this case, but the verdict of the Court of first instance awaits him first.
Despite this, in other processes he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the district court recognized the participation in the robbery of 19 people and the superior court, today, reversed 16 of them.
Most of the accusations of the defendants were rejected by the investigation for being fabricated causes.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up the robberies, and helped criminal group members avoid the penalties.
These criminals turned 30 percent of their theft over to Opava and Koňařík.
The accusation refers to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
Regarding the robbery, its victims suffered serious impacts on their health but they are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without a weapons permit.
In the house search, the police found some pistols, steel core ammunition, a laser aimer and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the indictment, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
Except for almost a score of men in this process, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring in other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who have thus far avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One bill for changing some children: 12 million
The lawyer for the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants 12 million kronor compensation from the hospital in Třebič for changing children in the Maternity Home, plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital&#39;s legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, does not agree in principle with Veleba&#39;s proposal.
&quot;We do not approve of such a demand, it is too high,&quot; said Dostál after today&#39;s meeting.
&quot;In order for us to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterpart ordered to investigate.
We will find out if it has a termination value.
We remain in the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for all &quot;highlighted Dostál.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloň&#39;s family wanted, for every month that they did not raise their biological daughter, one million crowns.
Velaba used as the basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist&#39;s report, only it was prepared at the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
The girls&#39; parents, according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry, suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stressful situation was better supported by the men although they fought with recriminations for the change of the girls.
Women take it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what happens today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were exchanged by the nurses at the Maternity Home in Třebič last year, on December 9th.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The Governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, handed over 100,000 crowns to each family at the end of October as compensation expenses for the mistake made at the Třebič hospital that the region runs.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors, they must withdraw from the reserve fund and can extraordinarily ask the administrator for help.
The court until today recognized them a proportionally low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily of one million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the Kingdom of Wallachia brand.
According to the judge of the Ostrava provincial court, it was the first to use the Kingdom of Wallachia brand, but the project was created over many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear for the oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
&quot;The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites on Bolek Polívka&#39;s popularity,&quot; said Polívka&#39;s lawyer after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, the image of the actor and comedian comes to everyone.
Harabiš also has the same idea.
&quot;We have been after us for about ten years of work.
Search for money and invention of activities &quot;he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
&quot;After years I have realized that the project is successful and that for this reason I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work, &quot;he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Kingdom of Wallachia trademark was first used by Polívka in his television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
So it wasn&#39;t about guiding him toward creating a fictional kingdom.
Some years later Harabiš came up with editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From this comical origin a business and a lucrative business activity emerged from which Harabiš later created the Kingdom of Wallachia society.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature on passports and even offered his holders discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees of his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
&quot;It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia,&quot; said the judge.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who have fully dedicated themselves to it.
The collaboration, between the now decomposed parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment on, conflicts began to arise between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the overthrow of &quot;King Boleslav I, the forever chosen one.&quot;
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš, led to the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka brought an accusation against Harabiš and his company, which to date has been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the dispute, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which Harabiš is already preparing.
From him should come the new king.
He did not want to reveal yet more data or dates.
&quot;We are in no rush.
It would have to be something like the king&#39;s road to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can introduce himself &quot;added Harabiš.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: prejudices overcome
To tell the truth, I have never liked the Peugeotu 206 too much.
Its ride characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, handling and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is its successor on the market, the Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and for me, I just have to think better of it.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 five-door, I was complaining, for example, about the headboard space in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I pass through the interior quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would value the design invention more even though the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike the model 206, the lateral steering has been improved considerably.
And the space? And here you can feel how the body measurements have grown.
In the Combi, the aforementioned scarcity of space at the headboard disappears.
Suitcases to the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
This I must value as very accessible (thanks to the folding tailgate) and well distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber belts that represent an ideal solution.
They do not disturb, and can be extended to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let&#39;s stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison with the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot lags behind with its noticeable 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when placing the baby carriage, its value is critical.
But if I had to comment something positive then I must mention the floor that is quite flat after folding down the backs of the second row.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition with a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, that&#39;s what a 1600 should look like that belittles the familiar five-door.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, it has momentum.
If I compare it to the škoda days of then that it seemed as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 crowns, is still possible.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbags in the headlands, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automated rear windows ...
That is to say, the car with everything of everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It is a lot, but count on the equipment accessories in the Fabia and you will arrive at a fairly similar number.
Now it only remains to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students are not integrated into English schools
Children from Eastern European countries attend English schools and therefore, the locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record those cases where conflicts between migrants and the children of the natives escalate in violence.
The problem of integrating Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between Slovak natives and emigrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, storming and fights between students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovakian woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In his defense, he said that the girl was insulting her son with insults of a racist tone.
The police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls treated him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
&quot;When we were going home, a boy came up to us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he made a gesture of throwing apples and pears at us, and then he pulled down his pants and showed us his butt &quot;He described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovakian student.
Complaints are from both parties.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with the emigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above, show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Great Britain there are 70,000 registered Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is truly the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be achieved, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and the all inclusive with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island does he find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port for the treasures that the Spanish extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the US (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba, such as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
Tall buildings arose in Havana, cars ran down wide avenues that were a cult symbol in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and had his yacht in Cojimar.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of the entertainment world and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita habanense.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, cocktails are mixed according to your wishes.
And those cult cars from the 1950s continue to operate in Havana to this day, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have rusted amid these damp and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating remarkably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surroundings as there.
Other places metamorphose into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by railroad lovers.
Sugarcane is transported from the huge plantations to the sugar factories by narrow tracks in steam or electric engines.
Their garages for dozens of years were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose sister models that are in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The place best known to most of the visitors does not change.
And therefore, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned Hemingway farm there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, they should not miss it.
The Viñales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Lush vegetation that grows on limestone rock lands.
Mogotes, limestone rock pylons and steep rocks in the slopes of the valley, and in its caves, fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rocky areas are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where probably the highest quality tobacco in Cuba is grown.
Visiting one of Havana&#39;s cigar factories you can find your final product.
Perhaps someone will find it interesting that the Chilean part of the series was filmed there, Major Zeman.
Trinity
A city of old ancestry that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth turned into beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is such a secluded place that even in the 50s of the last century there was no road connecting it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed either, because each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth visiting interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Playa de Ancón or the valley of the sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which enlivens the silence of the mornings with its music.
Baracoa
Small city in the extreme west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the path itself.
The two highways that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as through a nature that hardly knows the action of man.
This eastern place in Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (actually it is a cross that arrived 100 years after the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with its same Name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, an African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves , many pages could be filled with all this.
However, as they say, better to see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment is what is influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to the American defense minister, Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as expected, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland).
At the same time that conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today, the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to be more active, Britain sees as a priority strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
&quot;The development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population that they alone can start economic and security development, &quot;Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC station.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to US Army data is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province by up to 60 percent.
The NATO countries have in Afghanistan around 40,000 soldiers, of which a quarter are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
Exactly they ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
&quot;We will have to seriously think about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,&quot; Gates said.
In a similar vein, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
&quot;I&#39;m not happy to know what we have on earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment that we would need, and that is not much, &quot;De Hoop told Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the attending countries in recent months, the controversy prevails as to whether all the allies do their best in Afghanistan.
For passive was criticized, for example, Germany.
&quot;The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the demands of the struggle there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country, &quot;said Gates.
The tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
&quot;The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans play games while our boys fight,&quot; Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops were playing a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will reach one trillion in 2009
For every Czech the state owes 84,000 crowns.
Total debt amounted to 842.7 billion crowns in September.
This year the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crownsV.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kronor thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the economy of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt from the beginning of October.
For every Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
For the whole of the past year the State was in debt with more than 111 million crowns.
&quot;For now it seems that thanks to next year&#39;s low deficit we could cross the trillion kronor border until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900,000 million and a trillion crowns &quot;, said for the iHNed.cz server, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
The economist at Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora, also sees it in a similar way: &quot;We could spend a billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If the situation on the political scene was seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don&#39;t see such a change &quot;he added.
The doubt grows
The state debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
The state debt is paid by means of treasury bonds, government bonds, direct credits or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state grew this year from 38,500 million to 719,400 million crowns.
The foreign debt has so far grown from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion crowns and since June it was reduced by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
&quot;Total interannual debt from the first to the third quarter grew by 13 percent, which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that the growth is generated mainly from bonds where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform, &quot;said Pikora.
Better than expected
From the state&#39;s debt management and payment strategy for 2007, it can be seen that the government planned to lend itself 159.2 billion crowns this year.
In early December, the ministry lowered the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to improved state budget developments.
The amount is made up, above all, of the deficit in the state budget, which this year will be 76 million crowns in vey and the expected 91.3 billion crowns.
The remainder consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with about 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for the payment of pensions, 43 billion crowns to finance state obligations and 1.8 billion crowns. crowns in payments on loans from the European investment bank.
Today I was comparing Khartoum in front of a court to have given a name to a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insult to Islam was sentenced Thursday afternoon by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of having allowed students from 6 to 7 years old to give the name of Mahomet to a teddy bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was liable to a whiplash penalty.
This 54-year-old British school teacher from the Unity High School of Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with attacking Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her 6/7 year old students to choose a name for the class&#39;s teddy bear.
&quot;Eight names come out of the children&#39;s mouths, like Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,&quot; says the school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following caption &quot;My name is Mohamed&quot;.
The bear himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons&#39; Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting towards a religious faith, &quot;I&#39;m only sorry that she asked the children to vote for a name &quot;, according to him it is only an&quot; innocent mistake &quot;.
Opinion divided by many students of the school teacher who describe her as &quot;very attentive to her students&quot; and &quot;that she never talks about religion in class.&quot;
Recall that the name Mohamed is also the second most common name in Great Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we for example give it to a toy?
It is of course a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, during the last negotiation session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and the Albanians of Kosovo ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final session of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
&quot;It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status,&quot; declared European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Underlining that peace in the region was &quot;at stake,&quot; his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
&quot;We do not foresee violence for now but we are entering a very difficult period,&quot; he added, noting that &quot;evident tensions exist.&quot;
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90% Albanian-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council, between now and 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was commissioned with a new mediation by the UN, last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence in Kosovo, they insist on a persecution of the negotiations beyond this deadline.
&quot;Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,&quot; Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of the UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners see independence under the supervision of the European Union as the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in her favor.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
&quot;Unfortunately, no agreement has been found,&quot; announced the president of the Kosovo autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden where these &quot;last chance negotiations&quot; had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has shared his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade &quot;belonged to a past that has led to killings and deportations.&quot;
&quot; Domino effect &quot;
Serbian President Borís Tadic has considered for his part that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade says it particularly fears a &quot;domino effect&quot; in a region still weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
&quot;For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.&quot;
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a right of veto.
&quot;The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word&quot;
&quot;Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia,&quot; Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica had declared.
&quot;These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council. &quot;
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that &quot;the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status&quot;, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians would be made &quot;in consultation&quot; with the Westerners.
Bush starts an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he himself convened in Annapolis, Maryland on Tuesday, that the Israelis and the Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
He specified that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations in view of finding a final regulation of the 60-year-old disputed point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a &quot;peace treaty&quot; before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle &quot;terrorist infrastructures&quot; and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush declared, reminding both sides of their obligations on the roadmap for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would try &quot;to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues.&quot;
This denomination covers the three main thorny problems of the disputed point between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American president, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be &quot;global and in-depth&quot; and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing &quot;Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security , among other things &quot;.
On his return to the rostrum, Olmert pledged to make the forthcoming negotiations &quot;direct and continuous&quot; and to make &quot;an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008.&quot;
Bush set at the end of 2008 the end of the implementation of his &quot;vision of two states&quot; Palestinian and Israeli coexisting.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had secured a commitment in this regard from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks &quot;a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects&quot;, estimates Prince Saoud in his Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the attorney, the police are not responsible.
What precisely happened, last Sunday?
As every time in this type of event, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 5 pm, Luisa-Miguel street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
&quot;He was not in intervention but on patrol, and he was circulating at 40-50 km / h, without a rotating beacon,&quot; explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, &quot;not approved, that is not authorized to circulate on public roads&quot; (read below) and driven by two young men without helmets, circulated &quot;at full throttle&quot;.
&quot;He hit the police car on the left side, after a failure to give way to the right,&quot; the police said.
The breathalyzer test carried out on the occupants of the vehicle was found to be negative.
The condition of the car (smashed front end, cracked windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Attorney General of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for &quot;acts of involuntary manslaughter and denial of assistance&quot; to the IGPN, caught up with the departmental direction of security public of Val-d&#39;Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the attorney specified that the IGPN investigation into this stadium ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed &quot;the version of the policemen, namely that this mini-motorcycle came relatively quickly to their left.&quot;
Yesterday, a type of groove, no doubt caused by the footwear rubbing on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been stuck long enough for the police car to come to a stop.
The vehicles have been checked and will be the subject of a technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen would have left the site very quickly, thus not giving aid to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside &quot;any serious fault&quot; concerning this point.
&quot;It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigations, about which you have to be very cautious,&quot; said a police source.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these some moments that have followed the accident.
One of its windows that precisely overlooks the scene.
&quot;We went down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to revive them, says this witness.
There was nothing to do &quot;.
Then he saw &quot;a completely terrified policeman, who was limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young men, the fourth was talking on the phone. &quot;
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen have been taken by car by colleagues who had been on the spot.
According to this witness, the rescue workers arrived &quot;about twenty minutes after the police left.&quot;
They also practiced heart massages, to no avail.
&quot;I will not let it be assumed that the police services did not provide assistance to the young people.
These young people have been helped.
The firefighters arrived at once.
Everything has been done to try to save them, &quot;said the attorney for his part.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the introduction of a state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter replied with stone shots, wounding policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, lawyers for the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (center) and in Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers&#39; movement picked up on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president &quot;urged the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and waste to the who were sworn in before Musharraf. &quot;
&quot;The promise of Musharraf does not fulfill more&quot;
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly referred to the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to pronounce in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on October 6, by indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
&quot;Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court,&quot; the magistrate told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf&#39;s promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president &quot;does not value more&quot; after the establishment of the state of emergency, Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem told Monday.
He was expected to shed his military uniform between now and November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The assistant minister of information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied persistent rumors in the country according to which President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy head of the armies.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one pregnancy in three (36%) is not planned, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote on the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpected births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed a better &quot;control of fertility&quot;, according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill among women between 20 and 44 years of age has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated a little more or less a month for a couple in five and if possible for spring, a season considered the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crew members of the International Space Station (ISS) will have needed more than seven hours of work in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky trip that accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments &quot;botched&quot; by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a thick cylindrical piece in charge of soon housing European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see inset).
This module is a type of landing platform for the modules-laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was thus to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began rearranging the module&#39;s solar panels, which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And it is where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, has been damaged in a little more or less than a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to damage the panel any more.
The astronauts, who first had to make a control outing of the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to caracole at the end of the 30 meter length of the remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
It is one of the best &quot;spacewalkers&quot; (space walker) of NASA.
Tall, resistant, very skilled, he has a well developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this doctor by training has thus been commissioned to &quot;operate&quot; the &quot;injured&quot; solar panel.
After having precisely inspected the damage, he sectioned the fallible cable and installed types of &quot;slats&quot; in the damaged area.
He had been assisted by the second &quot;spacewalker&quot; who had stayed near the airlock and, inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped with insulator to prevent electrocution from the solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and &quot;botched&quot; by the astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking inventory of his instruments and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a noon break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for the return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the Stock Exchange
The EADS share is currently in sharp decline on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to face the delays of the A400M .
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to the delays generated by the slow progression of the development of the A400M engine, which conditions the maiden flight of the aircraft.
The cost to alleviate the delay taken in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to &quot;between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus&quot;, announced the parent company from the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new targets for the operating result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adds without any more encrypted precision.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be remembered that EADS &#39;operating result failed 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges linked to delays in another program, that of the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Choosing the status quo
No surprise at the polls on Sunday: Russians are going to opt en masse for President Poutine&#39;s party, United Russia.
Confirming his aspiration to stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today addresses voters a televised message on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything show through welcoming foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
&quot;We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incidents,&quot; he added.
According to the opposition, we are very far from the truth.
Denounce a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there are &quot;never had such dirty elections, even in Eltsin&#39;s time.&quot;
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, the former world champion checker Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
&quot;The Russians kept the homo sovieticus mentality&quot;
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Poutine to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful United Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It is a tradition.
&quot;The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel owners of their destiny&quot;, estimates the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, from the Saint Petersburg State University, goes back further: civil society in this Christianized country lagged behind five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, &quot;Poutine reestablished the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief&quot;, estimates María Lipman, from the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians &quot;voluntarily renounce personal responsibility&quot; of those who briefly gave proof after the outbreak of the USSR.
&quot;Why reflect?&quot;
The phenomenon touches all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of United Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of the fact that the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: &quot;Why reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them? &quot;
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are freely accessible.
Until now, the 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not only available for a &quot;humanitarian&quot; purpose, that is, individually and by name, at the request of a former victim or of his heirs.
The eleven states in charge of its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to search engines and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all the States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of the historians to Bad Arolsen will allow searches &quot;particularly on the displacements of the prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of the forced laborers&quot;, explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission. of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or the mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or of the arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the deported or subjected to compulsory labor countrymen and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to open the way to your compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
&quot;There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,&quot; Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Search Center on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität in Berlin, had declared in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, the Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches about 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India&#39;s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
The ministers of Foreign Affairs of the European Union had given their approval to the European Commission last April to begin negotiations with the aim of signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeastern nations. Asian (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches about 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India&#39;s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
&quot;A free trade pact will greatly dope both economies&quot; and &quot;India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans&quot;, justified Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants change annually for &quot;47 billion euros of goods&quot; and for &quot;ten billion euros of services,&quot; Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, had declared this week, feeling that bilateral trade &quot;has not yet reached its potential.&quot; The European Union and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England notes concerns by offering £ 10bn in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about easing the current turn of concerns over credit conditions, and announced a ten billion pound offer at the 5.75% base rate in five weeks, an offer of a duration unusual.
&quot;To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank has the It intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period that begins on December 6 in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, &quot;it said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will thus be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time it seems that the British bank BoE has placed liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are normally done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it &quot;is prepared to take other measures to keep the indices&quot; of interbank loans up to date in line with its base index.
The interbank index to date was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The index after three months settled at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were compounded into a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to it.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the exchange rate of the pound in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny the examination of the PS party&#39;s propositions on purchasing power
The UMP group and the Nouveau Center on Thursday refused to discuss articles of the Socialist bill on purchasing power, amounting to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist &quot;niche&quot; (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS among which the 50% increase in the bonus for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP (internal rate for petroleum products), a transport check or rent restrictions.
Since the UMP and NC have voted against the examination of the articles (180 voices against 115), the session has been adjourned at the end of the general discussion that gave rise to exchanges, sometimes live, between the majority and the opposition a few hours into the Nicolas Sarkozy&#39;s televised speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS deputies Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter / producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with British producer Melvin Benn&#39;s Festival Republic.
&quot;For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired nothing less than the current festival movement in America,&quot; C3&#39;s Charlie Jones confided to Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago&#39;s Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival would take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the UK, which annually attracts around 80,000 people.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then in 2006 the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also handled the production, licensing and organizing tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now host up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the &quot;most inspiring event&quot; he has ever attended, C3&#39;s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn&#39;s are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
&quot;We had chosen Philadelphia as our market and we were working persistently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
&quot;We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we got stuck in petty politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones pursues.
&quot;Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional location that will ultimately take place in Philadelphia.&quot;
C3 Presents resurrected the 2005 Lollapalooza festival in Chicago&#39;s Grant Park, after breaking out of the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $ 9.8M and $ 11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
&quot;Melvin Benn&#39;s European model is a country festival, while ours take place more in urban green areas,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
The objective is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give at the same time an impression of a country festival in the European way and urban in the American way. &quot;
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
&quot;The Vineland community, including the Mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states &quot;that they are interesting enough to allow investment in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life.&quot;
Charlie Jones says that the hotel supply at this festival is &quot;very large&quot;, like the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been released to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under press.
&quot;Vineland will have the flavor of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
His companions from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal .:
Montreal faces Terminator
It&#39;s not easy to lure Hollywood movie dishes to Montreal when nothing but the Terminator stands against it ...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate duties.
A mandate - &quot;politically difficult&quot; because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the &quot;runaway productions&quot;.
Is it difficult to compete with the &quot;Governator&quot;?
&quot;You have to be careful, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones that will judge the best, &quot;he says.
The race to the festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte&#39;s priority is nonetheless promoting the cinema here.
The race to the Oskares is started.
Every festival on the West Coast, be it Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Québec films, give them value and make sure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a good look at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is in theaters in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-the-year rally on the stock market? The experts, divided by the crisis &#39;subprime&#39;
With less than five weeks to say goodbye to the close of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this will occur.
Banif believes that &quot;from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock market tends to have a positive behavior.
However, it is not advisable to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainties lurk in the markets, at least in the short term. &quot;
Although they are not in favor of the stock market taking a run in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that &quot;the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected due to the flight effect towards quality values in both long and short sections &quot;.
For this reason, they believe that the stock market will behave rather laterally, not without volatility &quot;especially because the impact of the probable decline in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulus from inflationary tensions &quot;.
Javier Barrio, head of sales for BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there is going to be a rally.
&quot;It is not the thing for many joys,&quot; says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% from the highs set on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Still, not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that take place every year at this time.
However, the expert clarifies that things will be somewhat different this year since he believes that the rally will be brought forward to the second week of December, after the Constitution Bridge.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, values that we are close to technical levels and &quot;therefore we could see a rebound in the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis. in the credit market &quot;.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the securities that will be responsible for taking the Ibex to new highs.
Solana, from Intermoney, affirms that &quot;this year it is the turn of the great stocks.&quot;
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some construction companies &quot;because when the date arrives, the electricity sector will be very expensive.&quot;
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, from Inversis Banco assures that the increases will come from the hand of the banking and the industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to benefit from this rally, if it occurs.
&quot;ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,&quot; explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technological ones will also do it very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
Only twice in the past seven years has December been a bearish month.
The real end-of-year rally took place in 2003, a year in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December registered a 6.68% rebound.
It remains to be seen if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (at the moment the Ibex rises 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total 200, those located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8.30 p.m., and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. .
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the hours of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of Popular&#39;s experience will be decisive for other entities to sign up or not to this initiative that supports the business hours.
This is precisely the objective that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, SMEs, freelancers and shops on the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodeling of the existing ones.
To do this, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers on the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the hours is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more current design, with more luminous colors.
The head of commercial banking, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, although it does involve a greater hiring of personnel, since it goes from having about six employees per location to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O&#39;Donnell and Gran Vía streets in Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that with success, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the Mundocredit brand, specialized in immigrants, also with very long hours, which are even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax stores they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of their offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
&quot;We do not want to compete with our clients,&quot; says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with personnel outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We did it&#39;.
With that phrase yesterday Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the close of the market, when he verified that the chain he runs doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect clouded his joy: &#39;it is what hurts me, it is not because we have grown more but because we have decreased less,&#39; he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, &quot;we have fallen less.&quot;
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
This profit places its loss so far this year at 15.66%.
The market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday lost 1.52% and accumulates a drop of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the fact that &#39;we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are capable of doing, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience. &#39;
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television station this year to exceed 1 billion in gross advertising revenue, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group&#39;s advertising.
If this announced data becomes true, the television network would register this year a 3.6% increase in its advertising billing compared to the 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antena 3&#39;s net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (reaching 734.4 million), while net television revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 millions).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the better relative evolution in Telecinco&#39;s Stock Market is the high pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent Mediaset.
&#39;We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to whom we have already added value with 33% of Endemol. &#39;
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009 by 7%.
It is due, they explain, to the fact that it has cut the expected growth of income from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena 3&#39;s profit forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both stocks based primarily on their high dividend yield and sustainable long-term potential.
two.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco better (accumulate) than Antena 3 (maintain) due to the &#39;attractive multiples&#39; and business growth.
3.
JPMorgan: Recommends underweight in both cases due to &#39;similar threats&#39; (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
Parallel to its parliamentary process, which ended today with the vote by Congress of the amendments incorporated to the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the objective that both enter into force before the year is out.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to guarantee the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activity of the entities so that the markets function efficiently.
The Mifid, which modifies the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of financial markets, while reinforcing investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the different supervisors in the European Union.
The new regulations will allow the provision of financial advisory services to both specialized firms and individuals or legal entities and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory firms (AFI), which join securities firms. , securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for executing operations on financial instruments, so that the regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock managers.
The Law also obliges investment services companies to disclose in the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all the operations they carry out, in order to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
During its passage through the Economic Commission of Congress, several modifications were incorporated, among which it stands out that the securitized debts are considered as a &quot;complex&quot; financial instrument given their high danger for the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the US subprime mortgage debt.
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that economics and business graduates can perform 30 years after the royal decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists was approved in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work for someone else, will not require authorization from the CNMV and will be able to provide its services for marketing products and attracting customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonized CPI increases five tenths in November, to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides a preview of how prices evolved in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) of offering data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The leading indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modeling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the leading indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data, which will be released on December 14.
&quot;The CPI will continue at relatively high levels&quot;
The second vice president and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, has affirmed that the rise of 4.1% in the CPI in November is a &quot;temporary figure&quot;, but at the same time he has predicted that the price index will continue at &quot;relatively high levels. &quot;in the next few months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of Congress that &quot;although the figure is not good&quot;, Spain&#39;s inflation differential with respect to the monetary union remains &quot;more or less&quot; the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November &quot;there has been less surprise&quot; than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
&quot;We expected a figure of around 4%&quot;, acknowledged the Minister of Economy regarding the data advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise € 42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock&#39;s deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £ 12bn (€ 16.8bn) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time it amassed record deposits of over 25,000 million pounds, a figure that has progressively fallen in two and a half months due to the distrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of one hundred percent of that money that the Government offered and that it will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial commercial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the income in British banks that is deposited in the next three years to get those 18,000 million remaining pounds until reaching the target of 30,000 millions.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its flashy advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the bid from Virgin&#39;s consortium, which includes three other companies, as its preferred bid to rescue it from bankruptcy.
Totana mayor arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (from the Popular Party) early in the morning for his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then councilor of the municipality, and who according to sources of the investigation consulted by Cadena SER, could be the &#39;ringleader&#39; of this plot.
The agents continue to search the municipal offices and the urban planning department and more arrests are not ruled out in the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As reported yesterday by Cadena SER, the lawyer of the &quot;popular&quot; deputy Juan Morales, who was therefore measured, was arrested leaving Morales&#39; home with important documentation related to the plot.
Furthermore, the object of the investigation, according to sources in the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions by Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people detained.
Bono agrees to head the PSOE&#39;s candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the PSOE list for Toledo for the next general elections and to be president of Congress in the event that the socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting that he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because &quot;it is important to have the best&quot; in political life and Bono &quot;is among the best.&quot;
In addition, he has pointed out that &quot;it does seem&quot; that the La Mancha politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of Congress, who made public on November 15 his decision not to appear in the next general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fighting climate change in the university environment.
The former minister has acknowledged that the Prime Minister has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over Congress, in an &quot;act of transparency.&quot;
If he reaches office, Bono hopes to turn the Chamber into &quot;the house of respect and not of insult or shouting.&quot; and make it &quot;look more and more like the citizens.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to speak calmly and calmly is the Congress, the Prime Minister was interrupted in the Senate on one occasion 26 times.&quot;
Likewise, he has had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and &quot;his good work&quot; and he has not wanted to see himself occupying his position so as not to fall into what, as he has pointed out, his opponents could see as &quot;arrogance&quot;.
Climate propaganda
As the movement against climate change subjects both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles to merciless persecution, it is bound to display an iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the Government like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a &quot;new contract with the planet.&quot;
This approach forces him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for the breach, in which sectors it has occurred and why has your Government, the one with the contract with the planet, not prevented it.
In addition, it requires you to explain with the utmost clarity to the Spanish what are the measures you are going to take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will we be obliged to make, what economic consequences will it have.
In other words, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there have not been and will not be such explanations.
Precisely because it is about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the actual measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient, and threatening for corporate and individual accounts.
Even the penny of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so electorally dangerous to Zapatero that he has been quick to deny it.
In other words, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With powerful phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns who neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not pretend that we travel by bicycle or refresh ourselves with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local Police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the &quot;popular&quot; José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local Police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotelier for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have reported today .
The mayor was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Town Hall, in whose offices he is currently together with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Department of Urban Planning and the municipal management company of Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six carried out last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in development for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which is instructed by Court number 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have gone to court today.
As reported by sources, the former Totana councilor and today the PP autonomic parliamentarian, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former councilor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of Grupo Nuaria, the lawyer and businessman from Vigo, Manuel NA, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José MG, director of Land at Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, and through which the they would have made the bribes.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operative Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven searches, the majority in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was then arrested in Totana, specifically, the owner of a well-known poultry products company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with a &quot;spa&quot;.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would mean doubling the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate development; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks on Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza de Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; It advocates, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

If you think so, we are going to let the Book of the Month rest, to see if in the meantime we can come up with another premiology and other competitions.
I&#39;m already planning something.

Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment from yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the way, at the top of the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn&#39;s book:
&quot;The content of the signature of Philosophy has jumped to the public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the school of Jokela.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Minister in charge of the Philosophy subject, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools. &quot;.

A colleague passes information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of crimes on Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal discs worth less than 400 euros in the store, it is considered simply missing (article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros from the store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still less than that imposed on the discharge (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still less than that of the unloading (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the compact exchange.
Participating in a tumultuous brawl carries a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without the authorization of the authors is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone is losing his hand, a very long hand.

My GP gives me one of his weird research articles entitled: &#39;Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less&#39;.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depends on what their colleagues earn.
The study has been carried out using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life &amp; Brain Institute in Germany: &quot;The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.&quot;
The researchers observed that if when both were correct they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received twice, the activation was greater.
I don&#39;t know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecution office of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
Her mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because those mainly responsible for the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, remain in Liberty.
Their names are on that list from which the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, &#39;Carla&#39;s List&#39; (2006, not released in Spain) which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the prosecutor&#39;s work Switzerland from Belgrade to New York to hunt down escaped criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What insurance is best for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver against possible accidents, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of to this one, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
And, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, you have to be clear about what you are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is given to it. , among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the greater the probability of suffering an accident, the higher the fee to pay.
It is for this reason that both those over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since the statistics show that they have a lower accident rate due to their prudence.
Also, using the counts, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use that is given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with it the probability of having some kind of mishap.
Increasing the frequency increases the odds.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
That is why the driver has to study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age face various disadvantages when it comes to taking out insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the length of their license.
Although the ideal to be well insured is comprehensive insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for an all risk with excess, so that they obtain the coverage of an all risk insurance but at a more feasible price.
This type of agreement would mean that the client pays a part of the amount of the claim.
&quot;The part of the claim amount contributed by the client will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount,&quot; specifies Luis Noguera, head of First Europa, online insurance mediator, in Spain.
Another option is an extended third-party insurance, so that the client ensures protection against damages caused to third parties, although not against those caused to his own car.
In addition, you would be covered for theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
An advice.
If you are under 25 years old, try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, and may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company owns.
Rather, a penalty is a surcharge on that base rate.
&quot;The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses &quot;, clarifies Noguera.
After the age of 25, drivers have it easier when hiring insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to hire an all-risk franchise.
&quot;Normally young people cannot make use of the previously acquired experience when dealing with an accident, and even when driving,&quot; says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most of accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the &#39;rookie fear&#39; has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not have children yet, it is preferable to negotiate comprehensive insurance, as long as his financial situation allows it, of course.
For their part, married couples with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest accident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with a franchise (which could be 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, a third-party extended from the third year of the vehicle&#39;s life.
&quot;They conduct a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury of assuming a larger amount of franchise&quot;, Luis Noguera sentenced.
For retirees, full-risk insurance with a franchise is recommended (this being 150 euros), or one extended to third parties when there is a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver against possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic are looking for a point in Milan that is worth the round of 16
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday at San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective objectives in the closing of the &#39;Champions&#39; league, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians have ten points and already certified their pass with a draw in Portugal on the fifth day, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to ensure that Shakhtar, with six, and that they receive Benfica, who has four , don&#39;t overtake him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the entire sixth day, since Milan has to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where they make their debut on the 13th in the semifinals in search of a place for the final of 16 .
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw at Giuseppe Meazza seems the most anticipated result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic know that winning it would finish first and a better crossing would be ensured in the second round.
Gordon Strachan&#39;s team could even use a defeat to qualify if Shakhtar do not win, but it cannot be trusted because at nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to embitter the night for the Scots, who hope to get into the second round for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last season with a goal from Kaka in extra time (1-0) after 0-0 in the first leg.
Waiting for the victory of the &#39;rossoneri&#39; will be the Shakhtar to whom only the victory is worth, in the event that Celtic loses, both to get into the round of 16 and to continue in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver (Canada), in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they dissolved in 2000.
&#39;Posh Spice&#39; (Victoria Beckham), &#39;Scary Spice&#39; (Melanie Brown), &#39;Baby Spice&#39; (Emma Bunton), &#39;Sporty Spice&#39; (Melanie Chisholm) and &#39;Ginger Spice&#39; (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group&#39;s reunion is &quot;brilliant.&quot;
Around 20,000 people sold out the tickets to witness the concert that included a video in which the history of the group that was all the rage at the end of the 1990s is recounted.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that includes their main hits as well as two new songs, &#39;Headlines&#39; and &#39;Voodoo&#39;, which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage wearing bracelets given to them by the husband of &#39;Posh Spice&#39;, the British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the public that packed the GM Place, despite the fact that Victoria&#39;s nerves had forbidden it days before.
In the preview of the start of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British star &quot;has not seen our costumes, at all, so I am nervous about what he will think of the show.&quot;
&#39;Sporty Spice&#39; whose departure from the group in 1998 &quot;due to the differences between us&quot; caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
&quot;I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I&#39;m glad I made the decision, &quot;Chisholm said about the group meeting that she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that over time, &quot;things have settled down and we all love each other very much.&quot;
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of babysitters awaited them.
Between the five there are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), in San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will perform in Madrid on December 23.
New Russia-Ukraine Gas Fears
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every friction between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit fees.
An earlier dispute last year cut supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine should pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it will charge Ukraine more, as Ukraine has agreed to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say Ukraine could be paying 40% more for Gazprom imports.
&quot;It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks,&quot; Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
&quot;Changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about the levels of transit charges [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.&quot;
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supply with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS &quot;shall test foreign workers&quot;
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor the criminal records of employees from outside Europe, a watchdog said.
Auditor General Robert Black&#39;s recommendation came after a foreign doctor was found to be linked to the attack on the Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the number of foreign staff it has.
However, his report pointed to other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor general checked the number of foreign personnel recruited outside the European economic area, as a result of the attacks on the Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep outside the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Old Bailey via video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bombings in the UK.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Board of Health uses &quot;Disclosure Scotland&quot; to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Great Britain.
The auditor general&#39;s report recommends, among other measures, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
&quot;Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review,&quot; the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: &quot;our report highlights areas for improvement to ensure that the necessary information is available on the number of foreign staff of the NHS. &quot;
BMA Scotland President Dr Peter Terry said it was &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that pre-employment screenings could identify potential NHS employees who might commit terrorist acts in the future.
&quot;The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what is the added value of the recommendations made,&quot; he explained.
Scottish health authorities state that they currently have 1,161 foreign nationals, most of them doctors and nurses
But the auditor general cautioned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely adhered to.
This includes passport, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the NHS pre-employment policy and guidance for foreigners.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon says: &quot;I was very interested in seeing this work carried out in the wake of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups - including foreigners. what they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates at the film awards
Control, the biopic about Joy Division&#39;s late vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including Best Picture.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was cast in the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress for the thriller &quot;Notes from a Scandal.&quot;
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the variety award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis&#39; rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - featuring a soundtrack by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced for just £ 3,000.
But also the winner was the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic album art of U2&#39;s Joshua Tree album, awarded with two awards - for best director and best newcomer director.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - like Julien Temple&#39;s film about The Clash frontman Joe Strummer, which won the award for best documentary.
The best actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the chauffeur of a Russian mafia boss from London, in David Cronenberg&#39;s film Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel &quot;Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.&quot;
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honor of Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
&quot;It was people like Richard HArris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,&quot; he declared.
&quot;I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it&#39;s really an honor. &quot;
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors, and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal, and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell militants who were planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks against religious and security forces.
State television of the world&#39;s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was plotting missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the television report stated.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000-strong force to protect facilities at Abqaiq, the world&#39;s largest oil plant, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a &quot;missile launch expert&quot; that has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the country.
Another 22 of those arrested were planning assassinations of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining Al-Qaeda as militants, fighting allied forces and supporting the Muslim Shiite government, which is considered heretical by the Sunni Saudis. more extreme.
Al-Qaeda militants target many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by calls from Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born al Qaeda leader, to harass the country&#39;s pro-Western government - targeted government-associated residences for foreigners, government buildings and energy facilities.
&quot;This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months of work,&quot; the interior minister&#39;s spokesman told state television.
Those arrested also include a 16-person &quot;media cell&quot; in Medina whose aim was to promote &quot;takfiri thought&quot; - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of giving support and financial support to the militants.
Climate of Venus can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus may have once been a suitable place for life, scientists declared yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft showed the planet more like an Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is sufficient to melt lead, and it is eroded by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a picture of how the Earth could undergo catastrophic changes due to the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, declares: &quot;It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of Earth, when they are two planets so similar. .
&quot;Our new data makes it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago.&quot;
Police seize &quot;enriched uranium&quot;
One kilo of radioactive material, which they claim to be enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $ 1 million (£ 480,000).
Still remains open
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a YouTube debate, in which ordinary voters record video questions and submit them for broadcast to candidates.
None of the questions posed on the afternoon of Wednesday, November 28, were more ridiculous than the one about the snow monkey asking Democrats about global warming in the YouTube GOP debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party heading into next year&#39;s election.
It is not known exactly how the producers of CNN, who are co-sponsoring the debate, chose the YouTube videos to show the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to turn up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: Broadcasters noticed spikes in approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The harshest exchanges of words of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a leader in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney&#39;s reputation by being soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an &quot;amnesty&quot; (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Lesser candidates like Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, reached agreement on the issue.
Neither has the floor to be nominated as a candidate, but both remain in the race, perhaps because both raised the alarm on the immigration issue before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share points of view: increased surveillance at the borders, intolerance of illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of toxic toys from China and other concerns abroad, helps Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate turned awkward when other topics came up.
Mr. Guiliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, ranked first in the most recent Iowa poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressed to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the elections.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increases in Iowa, coinciding with liberal Ron Paul&#39;s fundraising drives, and his heated remarks from Wednesday&#39;s debate.
The two of them have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not reach an agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America&#39;s greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labor pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but still emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have sold influences, nor is it about exorbitant hotel bills in Paris, nor extramarital finger licking.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English ruling Labor party of more than 650,000 pounds ($ 1.3 million) for nearly four years using false names, and that the party did not. reported.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by stating that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the dreaded Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have turned business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative bungling.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the House of Lords, protesting cuts in military spending: being ministers of the military is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it&#39;s the multiple donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labor general secretary (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably walking towards the exit.
Governments can reach a tipping point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don&#39;t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is unnecessary: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and not focused.
In one part, Brown&#39;s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot defend himself on the grounds that he is new.
Although he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his superior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions that Brown made as chancellor of the treasury.
And even though it&#39;s not directly involved in the Blairish setbacks - or &quot;partner cash,&quot; the political party funding investigation - voters can assume it is.
However, Mr. Brown&#39;s situation is not as bad as it seems.
The gaffes are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor been outright scammed.
And the remedy, although painful, is to give what the naturally Stalinist tendencies of mr. Brown have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not made by him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors is clear and exists for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access from those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham, and that this was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the chief fundraiser who was asked about donations in October.
But Mr. Brown so far is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these proceedings, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the prime minister has done half the job.
He has been quick to condemn his party for breaking the law, but is diluted in the decision-making on a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter - led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter for the police.
Also, there are other things that mr. Brown must do, like find a permanent, independent chair for the Public Life Standards Committee, since he hasn&#39;t had one in six months, and he must also push for genuine party finance reform.
This will require hard cooperative work by Labor with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation with the unions - bitter measures for a partisan like mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; And the only way you can move to victory is to act with impeccable honesty and solid competence.
Sharks cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural for dorsal fins to swim excitedly around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their sights set on the country&#39;s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $ 99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and delinquency rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been written off or that are more than 30 days past due respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $ 1.4 million charge in its American consumer finance business, in part due to weak card borrowers.
However, it is too early to panic.
Delinquency and delinquency are at low levels.
According to Moody&#39;s, a rating agency, the third quarter crime rate of 3.89% was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American Personal Bankruptcy Law (2005) led to a sharp drop in bankruptcy filings, which in turn represent a large loss on credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore delinquencies) would be growing again, or it could happen that the conditions for the borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, showing how much of your debt consumers pay each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed securities is quite strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that issuance volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection from the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: Consumers like to load debts onto credit cards now that lenders are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more to cash flow than asset securities, so falling prices don&#39;t necessarily trigger a change in borrowers&#39; creditworthiness.
They can even work to get ahead of issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying off the mortgage decrease if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; And as a result, paying off the card debt goes up the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to difficult conditions from mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid asset price-down.
&quot;We&#39;re not going to wake up one day and reassess every loan,&quot; says Gary Perlin, Capital One&#39;s chief financial officer.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a credit crunch pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a harsher future.
You have to keep watching those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility for frauds with the former head of Enron&#39;s finance office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before US District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC at the Royal Bank, became notorious in Britain for extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after Enron&#39;s collapse in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The indictment against the bankers - dubbed the &quot;NatWest Three&quot; - alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former top aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, which was the originator of a myriad of fraud at Enron, which helped its downward spiral into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary at zero, but the three Britons knew that it would value higher.
A company under Kopper&#39;s control bought the subsidiary&#39;s bank interest for $ 1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $ 250,000 in interest on the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $ 20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers collected 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two counts of conspiracy in the collapse of Enron.
The trio of Britons were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a 3-year, 1-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay the 1 million dollars that they required to live in the United States while the trial was taking place.
Enron, one of the nation&#39;s seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting gimmicks, could not hide the debt of millions or make its failing businesses appear successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were charged last years for their roles in the company&#39;s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay&#39;s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price for a Gulfstream G550 jet, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $ 54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
&quot;It seats up to 18 passengers,&quot; says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
&quot;But no one asks for that model with so many seats because it is for private family flights or for company presidents.&quot;
Mr. Firer was cabin attendant for Gulfstream last Friday at the Millionaire&#39;s Fair, a four-day orgy of consumption held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had set up their show booths, hoping to attract new wealthy Russians to all manner of goods, from mahogany paneled yachts to 50-cent diamond-encrusted car grills.
Mr. Firer glances cautiously at a bright orange Porsche on the booth next to his. &quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a nice car, but it&#39;s nickel and change compared to us,&quot; he said.
&quot;After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.&quot;
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was in full swing.
&quot;We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists,&quot; says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
&quot;Like the Saudis in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world&#39;s largest consumers and spenders.&quot;
The world&#39;s most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires who make a total of $ 282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
Additionally, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $ 670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a think thank local.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below subsistence level.)
&quot;There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that&#39;s why we&#39;re all here,&quot; says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time together with the brand&#39;s Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
&quot;The women are impeccably prepared and the men are very worthy.&quot;
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in evening gowns, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
&quot;I was looking at the cars and I&#39;m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,&quot; said Yumatova, who reeled off the designer suit she was wearing as a veteran red carpet dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the nouveau riche, the kind of shoppers who would be willing to spend several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum penknives, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund&#39;s teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($ 44.57).
&quot;Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best,&quot; said mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a Dutch royal porcelain stand Delft, in front of a wall-size reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made from hand-painted tiles.
&quot;Of course the Russians are more interested in bling-bling.&quot;
In fact, sellers said that wealthy, older Russians (10-15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from flashy logos to limited-edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade show.
However, several thousand people: cash millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, fill the aisles every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, CEO of King Koil Beds, said he sold two mattress systems for $ 70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $ 170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of LA Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said that he had sold three chain-bracelet-shaped car grills for Rolls Royce Phantom for $ 55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes encrusted with colored Swarovski crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel. The cost: $ 22,000 for four wheels.
The cost: $ 22,000 for a set of four.
&quot;The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconia cubes is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels,&quot; says mr. Karapetian.
&quot;He is going to keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars.&quot;
Even if many of your Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase &quot;Russian millionaire&quot; does not mean exclusivity, given the surge in real estate prices.
&quot;If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it is not in cash,&quot; he said.
&quot;There are more of them than you think.&quot;
Those who weren&#39;t millionaires could at least pretend to be rich for the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British style) phone booths stuffed with stacks of counterfeit million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company&#39;s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit bills for the Millionaire&#39;s Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake stacks of money, asking their friends to snap photos with their mobiles as they rested on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of million.
&quot;You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,&quot; says Karryev.
Sloppy surgery could be cause of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the &quot;A Little Healthier&quot; restaurant and saw an ambulance drive up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another.
&quot;Then I saw the ambulance come up,&quot; said mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
&quot;That&#39;s when I knew someone had died.&quot;
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died from a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who has not yet been identified by police, but who works at the home at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo, but they wait for the toxicological test although the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help solve the mysterious death that grieves the top ranks of the Newark police officer.
Mrs. Arroyo had been an assistant to the chief of police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
&quot;She was loyal, hard-working and tenacious,&quot; says mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
&quot;She was my guardian.&quot;
She protected me. &quot;
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Liquor Control Commission, and that he left behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for County Union Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgical procedure.
&quot;That&#39;s one of the possibilities,&quot; Walsh stated.
&quot;It is an ongoing investigation.&quot;
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 PM
On November 21 and found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed and authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not say whether Ms. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine which part of the house was used for medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro&#39;s home, where a withered rose bush sits in the front of the house, and a Dalmatian barks in the back.
A blue drum labeled &quot;ethyl vanillin&quot; - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - stood in the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to the side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years with the NYPD, Mrs. Arroyo was an invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rugged political culture.
&quot;She would say, &#39;You have to watch with this one or that one,&quot; he said.
&quot;She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn&#39;t.
It&#39;s embarrassing.&quot;
The federal reserve is expected to cut rates to lift the stock market
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which were increased by reassuring comments from the vice president of the US central bank.
Stock markets loosened in London, New York, and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two to Ben Bernanke, chairman of the reserve, declared that policymakers must be &quot;flexible and pragmatic&quot; in responding to continued stress from financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure the markets amid growing swathes of credit markets, mr. Kohn said the recent turmoil was &quot;partly reversed by the improvement in the market in late September and during October.&quot;
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of further adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and businesses, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the US economy, such as home sales hitting a record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in an overall cost reduction to compensate for the losses of its investments in US sub-prime mortgages
Only 20 of those positions are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, at the close at 13,289.40, while the broad S&amp;P 500 index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than £ 39 billion to the value of Britain&#39;s top companies.
Germany&#39;s Dax index was up 2.6%, and France&#39;s CAC40 was up 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit tension in the markets was highlighted after strong demand in a three-month fund auction by the European Central Bank, which considered those loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the actions of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the London stock markets, strained credit and three-month &quot;Libor&quot; rates among British banks, which it was the biggest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England takes the lawsuits of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara with judgment
There are two dilemmas here, each as difficult as the other.
Who should beat No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no one is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the team on loan - with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, England manager, is beginning to fill with offers to become a national selector, and if not, in one part time.
Whoever doesn&#39;t get sixth at bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and so is sports.
It is not easy to throw away what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, because judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it just time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or &quot;Tubby&quot; Banerjee, two bright young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, had been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who is to say what is a good level for a cricketer, unless he is given a chance to sink or swim at the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the eye of the captain at the same time as taking a wicket and a batter for opportunities to change the order if he is to make an impact as a player one day.
But catching the eye of the coaches is more difficult.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who plays surely in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for fit and bowls like the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 runs apiece to earn a spot.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have had their highs and can expect more from them.
Shah or Bopara games at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
Choice can break or make a man&#39;s career, or it can make a little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each event and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time, who became a major player, And despite scoring a double cent against Australia in Australia, it may still be underrated.
The likelihood is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion in today&#39;s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their self-preservation instincts and favor Shah&#39;s greater experience over young Bopara&#39;s exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
In Shah&#39;s favor is his brilliant and worthy early-&#39;88 debut test in Bombay, 32 first-class hundreds to just 6 for Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent track records against spin bowling. .
But Shah did only ten runs in his two at-bats in May against the West Indies at the Lords test, his hometown as a Middlesex player, and that caused immediate pushback from the selectors when Vaughan claimed his spot for the next match, he seemed to have taken. of his batting some of élan than in Bombay.
By contrast, the Essex team have joie de vivre in spades.
He is fired up for nothing on the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he flipped his vehicle over at an exhibition for England&#39;s car sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and presumably shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching into the distance, to say excitedly: &quot;¿ Did you see that?&quot;.
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he hits with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best moment is another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which is not to say that Shah doesn&#39;t stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, he&#39;s the one playing here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses carrying Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling exiles who ran out of cash, without visa extensions and those who hoped the city would return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who led them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy made up of a dozen buses, the terminal was packed with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
&quot;I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,&quot; says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
&quot;I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that it is safe now.&quot;
&quot;They say that the Mahdi army stopped killing people,&quot; he says, referring to the Shiite militia of the religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to halt momentarily.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria as the regime does not want Iraqis working in his country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah phoned him to tell him that a US-allied force helped drive Al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
&quot;Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues.&quot;
&quot;That is why I came back today,&quot; said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they were drawn to the growing calm in the capital since US troops secured groups of armed &quot;concerned citizens&quot; working in cooperation with the US military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many declared to have returned due to the denial of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, voiced the common suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, called on the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees&#39; visas to force them to people to come back.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian death gangs.
&quot;We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,&quot; the Sunni said.
&quot;I cannot believe in a government that supports the criminals who set fire to my house after I left it.&quot;
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, easing the tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will reignite sectarian tensions and the fighting will begin.
Little Sarre, good manners.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines for the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sarlanders only lack an educational field.
&quot;Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlander that we are not Franseses&quot; - that was the ironic motorcycle about themselves of the smallest federal state for its centenary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the educational system of the Saarland which in a study by the Institute of German Economics (IW) called &quot;Bildungsmonitor&quot; ranked fifth.
Thus, higher schools by tradition have good relations with neighboring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can finish their university career here with two or three dipolmas.
Consequently, the percentage of foreign students is high, 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students coming from the Saarland is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a bacillerato.
&quot;In the Saar they take advantage of the vocational education system,&quot; says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute for German Economics (IW).
More than every five young people do their baccalaureate at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Saarland is 7 percentage points above the national average.
On the contrary, the range of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double courses, in relation to the number of the population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical professional training and growing demand, the number of Engineering Science graduates has dropped by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced higher schools to advertise more for specialties in Engineering Sciences.
&quot;After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools,&quot; says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
For the children to start studying the last year of the project called &quot;Kita-Jahr&quot; as soon as possible, it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model is also imitated by the other federal states.
Comparison with future studies will show whether student performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students behind in school development decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
But, in general, the Saarland did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the chagrin of the Sarlanders, the PISA report does not compare knowledge of foreign languages, although they could achieve good results in this field.
Despite the fact that the Sarlanders are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory subject in Secondary Education Institutes.
Chávez changes the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets the schedule change in the South American country, turning the clock back half an hour.
Currently Chávez is staying as a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will go to minus four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States imposed an obligation on the world in its day by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia due to the action with the taking of hostages.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
&quot;My dignity does not allow me to do it,&quot; says Chávez, who is promoting a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil-rich country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe to withdraw the mandate of Chávez in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in which the release of the hostages was concerned.
On Sunday Chávez said criticizing that the decision made by Uribe has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain there is a lot of talk about Chávez.
A new ringtone causes a sensation in the country: &quot;Why don&#39;t you shut up?&quot; Is the phrase that half a million people have already downloaded.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain, who felt annoyed by the continuous interruptions on the part of left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decline in real wages threatens the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decrease in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong economic situation.
Experts come up with a host of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
&quot;The blame for this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in the value added tax and the spurt in food and energy prices,&quot; Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Research told the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper. of business cycles.
Also the new unemployment insurance burdens may correspond to the employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper &quot;Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung&quot; that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% from year to year is fair and reasonable.
Naturally, the labor office does not have to get into an unpleasant situation again, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, in the words of a politician from the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: Earth&#39;s twin brother.
Despite its atmosphere not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to Earth, something that had not been considered until now. The European probe &quot;Venus Express&quot; discovered lightning in the atmosphere and eddies at the poles, the same ones that also appear in winter on Earth.
Researchers had suspected that lightning could exist on Venus for three decades.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, rays fall from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot;.
According to the famous Urey-Miller model of the origin of life, lightning caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the building blocks of life.
It&#39;s not like that on Venus: if there were life there one day, it would have to be in one of the first stages of evolution, &quot;explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and temperatures of 500 ° C reign on the surface, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
&quot;Possibly Venus is an &#39;evil&#39; twin to Earth, but it&#39;s still a twin,&quot; Russell said.
The main objective of the &quot;Venus Express&quot; mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth in its mass and size, has evolved so differently.
Since there were no special missions since the 1990s, only for research on this planet, the launch of &quot;Venus-Express&quot; in November 2005 was a very important step for the research of Venus.
The latest research results that will be presented in many &quot;Nature&quot; articles, in the opinion of the researchers, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
&quot;This also shows that neighboring planets have more common characteristics with Earth than we had expected,&quot; reports ESA.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, the researchers discovered a faster-spinning vortex formed by clouds in the south polar region as well.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of the wind flows in the high terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute for Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has a mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet, also called the morning star or evening star, orbits the Sun for almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not closely resemble Earth, scientists assume that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets water had agglomerated that on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus it dissociated in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had turned into carbon stones, on Venus it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel&#39;s rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, cares about Germany&#39;s reputation and therefore demanded that the grand coalition end that fight over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
&quot;In this case we must not present ourselves as ONE divided nation,&quot; Koehler told the &quot;Handelsblatt&quot; newspaper.
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
&quot;Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me,&quot; Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy, emphasizes the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach she received for carrying out a new policy with China.
&quot;The Federal Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional course of one-China policy.
China knows it too, &quot;Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his dislike for the reception of the Dalai Lama and because of this he was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its ineffective foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Sino-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources in the magazine &quot;Spiegel&quot;, froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Head of Government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China&#39;s position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept that European politicians receive the religious leader of the Tibetans in his official position.
The Dalai Lama&#39;s actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns of riots like those in France.
Battles with the police in the streets, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be riots as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that everything possible be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not take to the streets.
Barricades were built, vandals fired rifles at the police: after serious youth riots in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
&quot;We have to ALSO make sure that the social problems of our country do not take the violent form.&quot;
&quot;We have to take that seriously,&quot; he said in the &quot;Neue Presse&quot; newspaper, published in Hannover.
Not all young people thrive in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, the federal states and the municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
&quot;From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference: all this is already bearing its first fruits.&quot;
It is still early to take the end of the alarm for granted.
At the same time Schaeuble pointed out that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The youths staged serious riots in the streets with the police north of Paris last nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the unrest in France, warns of a copycat effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Despite everything, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above the average.
See to it that there are more vocational training positions.
Kolat stresses: &quot;We have to give young people a perspective.&quot;
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France &quot;there is great social control in families&quot;, greater than in the French country.
Furthermore, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat opines: &quot;But despite everything, we have to be careful.&quot;
It is necessary to &quot;give the opportunity to young people to receive a job or vocational training more quickly&quot;.
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police took part in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of almost 1,000 policemen has been taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Home Affairs Minister, announced that the police will take rigorous action until necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday around 80 policemen were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Toulouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young men died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the youths was not the fault of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance far from reality by the Federal Chancellor shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its last point and that nothing more is to be expected from her.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House, it must be said: she does not live in the country that should be governed by her.
As for the reproach that was made to him for having repeatedly engaged in foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that this would be a provincial way and thus showed he made it clear that he does not want to understand what interests the critics.
In the Lower House, it was stated very clearly and expressly to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
You could not feel the slightest interest, nor any kind of feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself this way: a very high politics that flees into foreign policy and stays there without accomplishing anything in particular.
One example: preventing climate change: she praised herself very much for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how these climate goals should be realized here.
In general, this way of praising herself - for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to allow herself so much modesty.
Well, he insists on expressions so that an impulse reaches people.
And in this way it damages its public image due to the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without beating around the bush.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, inner problems are appearances of little value.
Child poverty and concerns for low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about that topic using subordinate clauses.
It is amazing how many times he is wrong to speak when it comes to the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good sentence.
He begins to stumble &quot;as if it were in unfamiliar territory&quot; when it came to more specific information.
The attacks section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate of YouTube Republican presidential candidates and now have only one candidate from the outside to fear.
Right from the beginning the tensions between the candidates are noticeable.
Mitt Romney reproached his adversary Rudy Giuliani for making New York &quot;a place of refuge for illegal immigrants.&quot;
The latter, for his part, responded with serious reproaches: &quot;I would like to say that his own house was a&quot; port &quot;for the illegals.&quot; Giuliani answers the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed the illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as the Republican group has not so far had a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The little 30-second videos, shot by internet users that were sent to YouTube, don&#39;t have much content either.
&quot;With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power&quot;, that was John McCain&#39;s reproach to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one in the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism on the part of the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize like torture the &quot;Waterboarding&quot;, a method of interrogation, when allowing a person to drown they simulate their death.
The reactions of the public in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that meanwhile the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when they praised conservative values and denied the tax hike.
This way you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
&quot;At that time I was wrong,&quot; explains Romney ruefully and apologizes to the people and the television public for having been an advocate for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without a uniform.
A day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
Thus ends the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, was sworn in for a second 5-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to uphold the constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his mandate as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he seized power with a bloodless military coup, the former general governs the state for the first time as a civilian chief.
With his resignation as chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and of the west.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the swearing in Musharraf will very soon annul the state of emergency and fulfill the second condition of the west.
Since the state of emergency was proclaimed in the Supreme Court, there have been many Musharraf supporters of lawyers. Last week the country&#39;s Supreme Court rejected all appeals ahead of the controversial new elections for the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
According to information from the army spokesman, a bomb exploded in one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock return.
The most famous German band of the 70s continues its activity: three members of &quot;Harmonia&quot; participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release, a copy of &quot;Live 1974&quot; was made, which was written in the best days of the band.
Already in those days they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen to an official meal caused a sensation.
Each of them has in front of it its box, its cables and especially its buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking out of the auditorium, is 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Rodelius, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It seems that this does not bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for the Krautrock fans was the fact that the band Harmonia were making music again.
What needs to be revealed here is this: accurate questions have shown that the band&#39;s name reverberated in people&#39;s minds, but it wasn&#39;t something so special that after 32 years the public would miss it so much.
But why can&#39;t the Germans also applaud their living legend from the 1970s?
Especially since the Kautrock mistake was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an &quot;Echo&quot; music award to the members of the Can 2003 band from Cologne for their life work, the shocked faces of German pop artists could be seen in the room.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu !, everyone opened their mouths in amazement.
Later Michael Rother would hang out on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance at home and recognition abroad are one.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and in those days it did not achieve a great effect on the public, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
Some time ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, that promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Later, for financial reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a time, Rother had a little job at Kraftwerk and later worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that in those days was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more like an artist&#39;s life full of surprises.
As they say, one day an Ottenstein Harmonia singing association pennant appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for the art.
There were also downsides to using the name Harmonia.
The first album was called &quot;Musik von Harmonia&quot; and the second &quot;De Lux&quot;.
Although the music was calm and simple, the band struggled financially.
Life as an artist was not just about knowing yourself.
The CD &quot;Live 1974&quot; was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmonia and do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against the customs.
In 1975 the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up getting into esoteric themes and ensured his existence with albums like &quot;Flammende Herzen&quot;.
Cluster revived the eighties and since that time has been more successful than Harmonia was.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that&#39;s to thank Groenemeyer.
His Grienland music company made it a goal to cultivate his own German contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the band Neu! it was rediscovered.
Harmonia&#39;s presentation as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized by public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There&#39;s Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk, and the author of the &quot;Krautrock Sampler&quot; manual.
There is also present Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all of Krautrock&#39;s influences to the following pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno&#39;s phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: &quot;This music is the only true music, the future belongs to her.&quot;
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The history of the legend&#39;s development is shown in the black and white photo projections, where wired instruments are seen.
In the background are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing more than attach the microphones to the organ and drums so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of effects equipment they have built with their own hands.
Nowadays electronic music is the way it had to be.
Three people who delve into the technique.
But that does not change anything.
Under the direction of Bárbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment they cough, whisper and in a good moment of emphasis they sing &quot;Aaaaaaaah!&quot;.
Krautrock was always already a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who here yells &quot;68!&quot; He&#39;s right too, but now Harmonia is calm.
On stage, one reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does music start and where does it end?
That can break your nerves or give you a few quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere just lacks more cynicism.
The two films &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; and &quot;Moerderischer Frieden&quot; revert to the war in the Balkans.
But the two were not very convinced.
Either the concepts are very much focused on actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; cannot help in this case either.
At the beginning there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding in the Balkan mountain, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his nice and unimportant roles in women&#39;s movies and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now suddenly Richard Gere is the most important plot to see perhaps the movie &quot;The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he chases&quot; (Why nowadays movie titles have to be so long? and crazy?).
The film has a wonderful presentation to behold: at its core, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times in life are past, who as a monument to the ruin of his decadence retained most of his charm until now.
&quot;The Hunting Party&quot;, despite this triumph, together with &quot;Moerderischer Frieden&quot; which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The movie &quot;Moerderischer Frieden&quot; can be narrated in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very fast and that takes him also to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and the shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series &quot;Alarm Fuer Cobra 11&quot; without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; you can investigate, because in reality there was never a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and with another scriptwriter (Richard Shepard on two counts), the story about American reporters in the war leaving to spot a Serbian war criminal named &quot;zorro&quot; could probably be a new &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.
Thus, the stories are strikingly similar: the small teams go to the mountains twice to do something that the army cannot do, and each time it is a crazy trip.
One reason for the failure of &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; is when at the beginning we are introduced to Simon Hunt, who is not allowed to be simply a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also foresees an affair with a Bosnian Muslim that they are going to kill later.
So &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the headhunters in the world could not achieve for five years. , which was to capture the war criminal and leave it to the Muslim Bosnians to retaliate in a fair way.
It&#39;s so bad, it makes you want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on the crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in reality, a profoundly human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really worried about persecuting them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar that a very famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
In this peoma it is a mask of an Asian demon: &quot;In the big wrinkles on his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad.&quot;
In movies like &quot;The Hunting Party&quot; there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of Balkan war movies.
He recently published in a newspaper that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are flops.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always one rule applies: when a star enters a crisis region or minefields, then something like &quot;Rangoon&quot; appears with Patricia Arguette, &quot;Across all borders&quot; with Angelina Jolie or &quot;Bloody Diamonds &quot;with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all of these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It takes at least decades for Hollywood to make a good movie about the Holocaust, taking as an example the movie &quot;Schindler&#39;s List.&quot;
Some movies already need more time. Classics like the works about the war in Vietnam &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; or &quot;Full Metal Jackett&quot; in their time were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that&#39;s because screenwriters have no qualms (which is necessary in order to be able) to tell good stories.
&quot;To be or not to be&quot; or &quot;The great dictator&quot; turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn&#39;t know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don&#39;t have to be a good person to shoot a movie.
Maybe you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant gaze of an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel &quot;Lemprière&#39;s Dictionary&quot; and the war in the Balkans, he replied, &quot;That&#39;s just because some things never change.&quot;
Big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly murdered and in Yugoslavia war will always reign.
Von Beust receives negative criticism about the Olympics in response.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and economics for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust reminds you to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director general of the Hamburg chamber of commerce, on Wednesday called the resignation &quot;not good for the economic situation.&quot;
In recent times, no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
&quot;Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level.&quot;
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application &quot;that refers to another time.&quot;
On Wednesday Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his remarks that Hamburg&#39;s ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
&quot;Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, it is decided by the German Olympic Sports Federation,&quot; von Beust says on WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December, on Munich&#39;s request for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
&quot;This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will not have any opportunity.&quot;
Despite everything, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut&#39;s statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympics.
&quot;It is too early to let the opportunity take away, if at the moment the plans are ruined,&quot; Günter Ploß, the director of HSB, said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is contradictory to the statement of the head of the senate that he made at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German public sports federation of higher schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg&#39;s application for the 2015 Universiade not as &quot;a substitution&quot; for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Higher Schools Sports Federation named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The Fraction of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the Senate for not taking advantage of the valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
&quot;For many years the senate delayed with the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses,&quot; said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) .
While the SPD always demanded integrated Olympia planning for little Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg&#39;s application for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
They are not the wooden boxes.
Whoever relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or if?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that hangs over Warhol&#39;s list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Gloss-Box &quot;types&quot; on this list are bogus.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; cast doubt on the authenticity of Andy Warhol&#39;s 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the Moderna Museet in Stockholm conducted internal investigations and reached disappointing conclusions: the six &quot;Brillo-Boxes &quot;, which the ex-director of the Pontus Hultén museum gave to the Moderna Museet museum, are false, and almost a hundred of the others of&quot; Stockholm type &quot;, which are in circulation in the international art market, also turn out.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first &quot;Brillo-Boxes&quot; in New York, he painted the wooden boxes red, blue and white, with the same sample that had &quot;Brillo&quot; soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his works in 1968 at the Moderna Museet hundreds of cardboard boxes were exhibited. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expense), but were brought directly from the &quot;Brillo&quot; cardboard factory.
They were not works of art, but specimens (which were only a few objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed some wooden Brillo-boxes to be produced in Sweden, but they were not exhibited in the Modern Museet.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered art and auction history as originals of the &quot;Stockholm-type&quot; &quot;Brillo-Boxes&quot; authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions some of them were bought for more than $ 100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him were produced and exhibited.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in Saint Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already died for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the chief curator of the Moderna Museet, investigated six Museum-owned Brillo-Boxes and also three privately owned Swedish that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. Their tight silvers were first printed and ground and then painted in oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies from the year 1990 shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the pressed plates. Also, it is not about oil painting, but about acrylic painting.
&quot;These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo-Boxes&quot;, says Lars Nittve, the director of the museum Moderna Museet and adds that if The Commission of Authentication &quot;Andy Warhol Art&quot; in New York he will not come to any conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify these six boxes as the copies / exhibits &quot;.
Already in July, the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these &quot;serious accusations&quot; in that they are boxes of soap powder.
But from that moment there everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the downfall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
The leader Antonio Trillanes, who criticizes the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for shedding blood.
Government loyalists had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers barricaded themselves in the building for a few hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had a trial on Thursday for having attempted a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 supporters.
Obviously the military policemen who were supposed to watch him had joined his ranks and continued his mutiny.
They entered the &quot;Peninsula&quot; hotel and demanded the downfall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blockaded the neighborhood around the Hotel Noble.
The president called an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Advisor, condemned the soldiers&#39; behavior.
&quot;People are fed up,&quot; Trillanes said.
&quot;We call on people to join our ranks.&quot;
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said that before long the other military troops wanted to continue the march.
The great critics of the government called on Thursday a large demonstration against the president.
For months his government has been reproached for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines there have been at least seven coup attempts against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel&#39;s largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday the company reported that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
You have only 20.05 percent of the capital stock.
There was a lot of speculation about the takeover of the company.
There are also options to further increase the financial side at Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
They made the assumptions about entering the business on Wednesday, after the bank Brendenberg increased its stake to the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market this means that the financial institution maintains the participation certificates for a third party partner.
United Internet already had the telecommunications company Drillisch participate with almost 10 percent the day before.
Drillisch in the capital increase measure placed 17.4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares from them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies began negotiations on marketing cooperations for DSL-products.
&quot;We are strengthening our collaboration,&quot; the United Internet spokesperson explained.
The two companies founded a joint venture MSP, to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday United Internet reported that at the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with the 10 percent stake in Freenet and do not use their right, that is, they involve 18.49 percent of Freenet.
That meant that both companies kept all options, especially the stake in the Freenet joint stock company.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This &quot;game&quot; with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or full contract.
Until now, the United Internet and Drillisch holding company had a direct 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
So they had agreed that Drillisch is going to get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
