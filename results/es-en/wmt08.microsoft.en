European inflation slid into food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is mainly due to the dizzying growth in the price of foodstuffs.
The price increase in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, registering - after 2.6% in October - annual inflation of 3.1% - announced the Luxembourg-based Office for Union Statistics.
Official forecasts only likely gave 3 percent - the Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and the reduction of forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least about two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "you have to negotiate" on inflation so that it does not have to intervene on this issue later.
Inflation of 3.3%, recorded in Germany, broke the record of twelve years; in Spain, it increased from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation soared in the euro area as a result of galloping food and energy prices.
Wheat term quotes increased by 88 per cent and soybean prices have peaked since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52%, reaching almost $100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1% to 2.5%, but by 2009 it will already decline to 1.9%.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain around 3% or 4 months over the next 3 months, however the average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates twice during the year 2008.
Gallup foresees government crisis
After a long stagnation, support for the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly by early December, peaking since 2002, whereas Gallup has never experienced such a low level - 13 percent - for the Socialists before.
The difference for party safe voters - due to the increased firmness of opposition voters - would mean support of more than two-thirds (71 per cent) against support from one-fifth for socialists (20 per cent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the limit necessary to have any parliamentary escano: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among safe voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous lower point - the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation particularly bad has never been so high, while another 46 percent believe the situation is rather bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as the next year is concerned, the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only a tenth expect improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of respondents, higher than any previous Gallup survey, estimated that the President of Government rather performs his duties badly than well.
13 per cent of respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány very much, wherea as Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 per cent of respondents.
54 percent of the population does not trust the Head of Government at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced in front of the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October unrest last year 35 per cent felt that it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, this proportion is now only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) believe that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of respondents to the participation question responded that they would surely participate and another 20 per cent said they are likely to participate.
By way of comparison, "a general election to be held on Sunday" would surely involve only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believe their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of voters, there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
74 per cent of the population would disapprove of the payment of study rights, 79 per cent for the medical consultation service and 84 per cent for hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would refuse the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupling its prices
The average price level increase of 16 per cent was maintained by hypermarkets in the golden trading triangle of Budas, with the difference that VAT has not been increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the golden trading triangle of Budas, the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth well above the HUF thousand.
As prices in food supermarkets had already been "soared" in December last year, this did not see a drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy at a price well below nine thousand HUFs today cannot do so for ten thousand.
Napi's basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003 that basket cost HUF 6800.)
The price of Unicum liqueur and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than HUF 200.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with a redeemable bottle of two liters cost less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan's basket it was the most expensive, as Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to Christmas prices last year, Cora increased by 15, whereo Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent the prices listed in Napi's basket.
Comparing the values of the most expensive basket of the past year with that of the cheapest basket of this year, the difference has been 12%, wherefore the growth between the cheapest of the last year and the most expensive of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during Christmas last year in prices there was an increase in VAT.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader mis plans the speed of circulation of a product, he or she may lose a significant profit in the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of Napi's basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher with HUF 1720 than the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year did not produce such extremes, since the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, catastrophic price growth was recorded in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of basic consumer goods grew by more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some basic foods, recorded in the 12-month interval a price increase of more than 30%.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to Napi's basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case only a 10% increase in prices.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, being able to impose the drastic increase in prices even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the gold trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
Based on our collected experiences, most consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking the preserved foods by pallets.
In Wednesday morning, the three stores formed large queues ahead of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country sales volumes are lower, numerous multinationals complain to the survey institutes because the income falls below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in that of household appliances.
In many hospitals you save on disinfectants
Several thousand infections first caused by the improper application of antibiotics have been reported in hospitals.
Hygiene circumstances in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and staff overload do not favor infection control - says the medical-head of department of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many hospitals you save even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, a contagion with MRSA has been diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital in the early anus.
An injured person from a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient soon after had to return to the hospital as a result of the contagion with MRSA and since then no major surgical intervention has been possible due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until December 10 of this year, cases of hospital infection caused by multi-party agents have been recorded in the Nosocomialis Surveillance National System- said Karolina B.R.cz, medical-head of department of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that this number of infections caused by multi-party agents has certainly been reported in hospitals, the rest of which is unensent.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxycillin.
A third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (HS) bacteria in their nose without causing any disease.
HS infections (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once antibiotics are overly or improperly applied, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics, develop into highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria and quickly spread in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause severe hospital infections, such as wound infections or septicaemia first of all to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with weakened organism, the elderly or low-weight people.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
Not to be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where his presence is not examined.
Antibiotic-resistant
"These patients are isolated, nurses treat them in rubber gloves and mask and there are antibiotics suitable for their treatment," Tibor Nyulasi said.
Hospitalized patients are pre-examined to check for mrsA in their body, but infection cannot even be prevented in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however current national hospital circumstances do not promote the prevention of training and contagion with multi-party pathogens, says Karolina B.
Because this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the patients who carry mrsA in their body.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also because the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient - said the doctor-head of department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes rigorous entrustments for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological tables.
It is necessary to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be done to prevent resistance to medicines, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less common for traveling patients or in basic care , said Karolina B.
Saved with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA spreads from one patient to another through health workers.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, however considerable faults are also experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
More importantly, hospital wards are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately you can also experience it," added Karolina B.R.cz , who in less favourable economic hospitals saves on disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and that is why there is a greater likelihood of infection.
In the view of Karolina B.R.cz, where appropriate prevention measures are met, fewer such infections are recorded or the contagion of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treating contagion with MRSA is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is fought.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
The program appears to be successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-party agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative blood alcohol control of police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report has been made on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of the XXII district.
It can be excluded the possibility that was driving drunk or in a stunned state since then resigned police commander of the XXII district, who on Tuesday ran over and caused the death of a passerby - attila Morvai, spokesman for the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, reported on Friday, after the expert report on the case had been prepared.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary blood-alcohol check that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The head of the XXII district police station on Tuesday with his private vehicle by bending to Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district ran over a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian area.
(The latter fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when bending.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
Because of what happened, the district's police leader resigned and applied for retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation into the case is carried out by the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with the prosecutors in charge with the investigation.
400 million euros more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EI) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements in Budapest on Friday worth 400 million euros to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EI) approved a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget environmental transport and protection projects, which will be made from the cohesion fund subsidy, of which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million , the contract they have just signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The credit agreement of EUR 150 million is also used to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EI approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective of Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million the decision will be taken later, when extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the project of innovations and research of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th Metro line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalized the details of Metro funding with the EU, they will return to the issue that whether or not it is necessary to amend the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EI has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth 8.4 billion euros.
The interest on the credits is in accordance with EURIBOR and the EI offers a grace period of 8 years, without charge for keeping the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that aforementioned Balkan country.
What, where and those who buy on the EU's even cheaper market, will get faster?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred goal for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slope apartments and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches Albena, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will pique the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Likewise, the capital Sofia can be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their lives and the way they live.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in ski paradises.
Foreign clients can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in bad condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They demand good communication and access, and for them it is important the proximity of a big city, the shops and usually a local doctor.
The second category is the buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group is real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital properties is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, in the last five years they suffered an annual increase of 21%
The increase in the price of real estate significantly exceeds wage growth.
Fodor and the six by hundreds Hungarians
As reported by environment and hydrology Minister Gábor Fodor, expert-level meetings will be held on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official opening, negotiations at the minister level on the post-2012 international climate regime will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world discuss the Balí Roadmap available on post-emission reduction efforts under the Kyoto Protocol, which is in force until 2012.
Lively discussions are currently taking place between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate on precise figures at the moment, although it tends to agree that compared to the 1990 situation, until 2020 the emission of greenhouse gases will decrease by 25 to 40%.
Another major theme of the conference is that if industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing or unwilling to offer material and technological assistance to countries that need it.
Further agreement was reached on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the Piac és Profit.
The six by hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Environment and Hydrology Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to retain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing by 2020, with respect to the 1990 level by 20 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed and it is willing to commit to even decreasing by 30 per cent if the world's other large developed regions and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in line with their responsibility and their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor noted that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol pledged to decline by 5.2 per cent, with the then 15 EU Member States committing to a 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce with 6 per cent the emission of greenhouse gases compared to the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will comply with - the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
Much is at stake in Balí, since in two years the international long-term climate policy agreement will have to be signed, because otherwise it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed by post-2012. In this case, the reduction commitments made under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need of which was noted in its most recent report by the IPCC, the UN international scientific association dealing with climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay the reduction in emissions and could not prevent an increase of more than 2oC in earth's average temperature, a fact that scientists say would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British army recruits on YouTube
British army units at a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First it was the British Air Force (RAD) that took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar's general body of operations, then sent to London for upload to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are already 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been uploaded in this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
The air force had originally uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the British army's presence abroad.
This type of propaganda costs virtually nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots - defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the raison d'e sort of military action decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army also cares about the fact that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear in the distributor, for example about the death of soldiers: in the propaganda films "official", a little hypocritical, the officers speak at most of losses, without presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded to the Internet from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only lately seizening this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with the free downloadable shooting video games called America's Army, where in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put themselves directly instead of the soldiers.
Tombola and savory cupcake at the Ministries Christmas party
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth doesn't seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 with savory cupcake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate their party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so the power is fun.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defence, but not for Ministry workers.
At the Christmas of the Orphans the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts and for Christmas the Missionaries are invited to the relatives of soldiers who currently serve missions abroad. A reception will also be offered for the press.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the end-of-year festive environment.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET festival will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of HUF 4 320 000 and of the six hundred ministry workers, approximately three hundred and fifty are expected.
At the party of the wallet will reign a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform and there will be a tombola draw.
Christmas of the ANF cost 4 700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Board of Directors of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers in one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we are unable to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas held the Lucia Day dance on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of its facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister's words of greeting and after dinner there was live dance music.
In answering the question [origo] they reported: to attend the dance it was not obligatory to wear a suit or evening dress.
Health, labour and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and party for its workers in its own building with a budget of HUF 400,000.
Instead, Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year work meeting.
There are the participation of one hundred and eighty guests who - as reported by the press department - will have only coffee and savory pastries, so the party will cost no more than 350 000 HUF.
Local government minister Gordon Bajnai will instead simply toast with his colleagues in the Ministry's classroom for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own function room with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of HUF 2500 per guest - from this budget you will pay the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse, but also by the afternoon schedule of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a Reception of New Year on January 20, the Ministry will not hold Christmas.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and as communicated by the portfolio, there will be a budget of HUF 1000 per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple reception standing, which will be invited only to specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary.
These receptions, held every year, begin with a brief greeting speech from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas parties - this is what the corresponding press departments communicated to [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that more than four hundred people were invited for the festival to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
Forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Commissions will on Friday form a strike commission to coordinate Monday's strike that will last indefinitely.
A rally of protest will be held on Saturday, while on Monday - the day the final vote on the public health law will be held - work stoppage will begin.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, since rail traffic will stop completely and until 13 hours the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike which they will hold in conjunction with the National Federation of Workers' Commissions.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Machinists' Union will also be formed to coordinate Monday's actions.
A rally of protest will be held on Saturday, while on Monday participating unions will go on strike indefinitely, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves of public health law, trade unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike action.
Instead, if the law is passed, strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of monday's agenda of the National Assembly, it is also possible that it is only possible to vote on the public health law at very late at night, or at best around midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will have to be significant difficulties in transport: the railways will stop working indefinitely, tomorrow there may be a part of Budapest's collective transport and more than half of the intercity bus transport of the Volán companies.
Simultaneously, in many points of the country there will be closure of half the roads.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, others for a defined time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) were unable to reach agreement even on minimum services, although as Christmas holidays approached, more and more people are travelling on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 13 hours the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be on strike, those of Budapest Airport from 7 to 9 in the morning, will hold a four-hour strike by the Liga Unions of the Electricity and Thermal Energy Industry, the Educators' Unions called for a strike of 2 and the Democratic Union of Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will go on a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers' Workers (SDTSSS) who are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is for the government to withdraw its proposal on public health reform and to put a new conception into a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation that will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, for advanced pensions the possibility that the occupations that deserve it may enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on railway side lines and expect a different proposal.
Political Capital: In the country the risk of the Hungarian Guard is increased
According to the Risk Analysing Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, established in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region.
The company's "risk warning" writes: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of ethnic tensions between Hungary's Roma and non-Roma population, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur."
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably the provocation of such an event, added the representative of the research institute.
They stated that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave public debate of the Roma problem to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the discrepancies between Roma and Hungarians".
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
On the other hand, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international average, "significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, especially in terms of the stability and democratic development of the country".
They remind us that: since the 2006 otono, many organizations that self-defence "national self-defense associations" have been formed in the country since the 2006 otono.
"The common feature of these groups is that they defend themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, that is, the state"- they add.
They said: all this occurs in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on society's discontent with politics and political parties.
To highlight the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations is not only used to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighborhood relations.
"In recent months, in many neighbouring states they referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures from certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard,.
All this influences the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks were increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a similar way as the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the mass riots of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to form the guard, on the grounds that the organization's objective is "national self-defense."
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - remembers the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes which certain Gypsy organizations in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that Hungarian gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Political Capital's director of research, Attila Juhász, to the news agency's question stated: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change in risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by issuing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around holidays - which next year will be less - workday is reorganized.
Even in the EU or North America, parties are not unitary.
Hungarian law makes a difference between national holidays, state holidays and holidays.
The festive days are mainly related to religious festivals and historical ephemeris.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter especially so that those who spent the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23, a commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th we celebrated the founding of the State, on May 1st the feast of work, on November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased family and friends.
In addition, in our country are two-day holidays Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it often becomes a bridge when before or after the party there is only one working day.
In exchange for the long weekends as well, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
He is the minister of labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory on the other hand for companies and service institutions that, due to their role, work uninterrupted even during the holidays.
This year the work order can be altered only around the end-of-year festivities: from December 24th practically life in the country is stopped, since according to experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year several of our parties will coincide with mid or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working hours than this year.
The agenda around the work party will first be changed so that workers can then rest for four successive days.
Saturday, April 26 will be working day, so that in return Friday 2 May is a festive day.
The other change relates to the October 23rd party: on Saturday, October 18, we will have to work instead of Friday the 24th.
On the other hand, the anus that comes during the end-of-year feast will be rested, since from December 24th almost no work will be worked on, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little deterrents to sour your colleagues' lives
Emails we forget to send, sound messages we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing it: they are all part of our daily Folklore" at work.
You have to decide if you adapt to the small discomfort or consciously avoid the confusing situations that can irritate others.
Tips.
$isculpa, I forgot to let you know you've been wanted from the marketing department" - says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best he's sorry and trying to fix the matter, he might call the marketing department to tell them he forgot to give you the message (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding with embarrassing explanations, it's worth pondering the things with which you can sour your colleagues' lives and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more irritating than when you want to pick up a document, an office tool or your phone and you can't find them.
Remember you put the stapler on the table yesterday, but by this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost pen on one of your colleagues' table?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they'll rightly be mad at you for subtracting their stuff.
Don't take envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and run out of time.
You gossip about your colleagues' private lives?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information you have about the particular life of your colleagues!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you've heard and not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even if others also know things about him.
Are you leaving sick leave unjustifiably?
When you phone the office and say you're sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or, you feel like you prefer to rest that day; think that others should do your job, your impossible tasks, your work on the end.
Don't with your buddy!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something can happen to you, so you will have to stay home, communicate them, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to confront you absence the next day.
Humming, giggles, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but are your colleagues' giggles abruptly taken from him?
Have you unintentionally heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to listen to it?
Don't bother your colleagues with your humming, singing, conversations out loud (except when you make them above their heads), kicking, constant profanities, expressing your discontents aloud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not currently delving into a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you've forgotten to send an important letter or a message!
Don't allude to the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
Feeling too much at home in the office?
Jogging and slippers: very comfortable habit for the house, but it is not suitable for the office!
Don't wear a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don't be disarced, respect your colleagues and yourself wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car is slowly advancing in the usual morning traffic jam.
A strange compass sounds on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I turn up the volume.
Change the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female chorus as a real gem intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays Zagar's song Wings of Love.
National musical life didn't spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jam seems totally different when you're listening to Zagar's new record.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs of the national digital underground gradually change the image and although again garage style rock is fashionable, it breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer began his career in the city of Pécs, played in Yonderboi's ensemble until he began his independent career perhaps because the two cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when asked for film soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc T.R.K. Szezon).
The wider audience knew the ensemble that initially performed only in small clubs when wan2 magazine selected their first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend trainer, capable of being sold in Western markets as well.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they are happy to wear this label.
The set reacted as it should react: it prepared a new and even better disc.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new ground for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient ensemble of Balázs Zságer.
It is well the reference about the airy, about the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris Gyergy Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a true success of the mr2 channel Petafi which lately broadcasts from morning to night popular music. This station brought wings of Love's high-flying music, recorded with six Hungarian singers ($ivas Underground, to the ears of the broadcasters.
Well, everything's in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success comes the question: what are you performing, to what extent is it music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from sincere inspiration.
Listeners' attitude also works in this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially west of us, light music has larger traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty years frequent the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from, and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good to see more and more people attend our concerts.
But we've never written music for the market.
We don't compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public rather is felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works solo and made his career rather west of us.
B.Zs: We don't go their way, even though they sometimes try to compare our music with his.
Rather we work as a team, rely on each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they would compare our work with Yonderboi's music, as many of us started our career in their group and from there we set out on another path.
hvg.hu: In the list of hits of mr2 Petafi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great successes and sell our album with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it to the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound of the album and the heavier tracks.
hvg.hu: How did you select all six singers?
Why just to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of good voice soloists from our own national musical stage.
This is how that six-woman choir was created - namely Seine, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik-Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was later christened Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you compose exactly how the song or did the girls change a few things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we had all the material on the album, we thought something was still missing.
The chord attracted singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came practically to the first attempt and incredibly spontaneously.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I also needed the Divas.
With my voice it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the record it looks like the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role of their own, they sing all together and no more loudly than music, so music not only accompanies their songs.
They are also located in the background on the stage.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously didn't want to distribute solo roles.
The song also deals with it, about us forgetting for a while our ego, the one from where it came from and where it goes, so let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted to make others feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you do the most work to?
Zs.B.: In musical composition actually none, rather when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma where I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to run the groove and then, little by little everything was put in place like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B:This constantly changes with the concerts and because I have already "released" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A disloyal embezzler.
This is how he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banker giant of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Trade Bank.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, without a doubt, to good abilities.
He sensed a long time ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" he let himself be hearn from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what follows from Kerviel's responses according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, is that he was a man who at the end of last year made a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros from his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in his answers.
Precisely, in the summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity has already been seen coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income clients or those who have struggled with payments in the past and that those customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not influence the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
"When I've already won my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify it," Kerviel confesses, adding, that he hasn't left anything to himself at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had misrepresented the records in such a way that his discovery would not be made.
He even tricked the bosses, even though the Eurex Stock Exchange became interested in his business.
Risk became a benefit
Were you afraid it would be discovered?
Rather, no.
"I thought I had earned $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would cheer them up."
Where did you get so much willpower to take such a risk?
In my position I had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing his study in Lyon.
His annual salary was handled at between $51,000.
Two years later he was an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
I still knew I was never going to make as much as everyone else.
"In my first interview in 2005 I already observed that I was looked at cautiously.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a 500 million euro title.
And this was a starter mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll leave you
"This is like a snowball," the police said.
But it is said that the chiefs knew about all this or that they rather suspected it.
"As I made money, they closed their eyes."
Only then came the coup earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all traces.
When he got to work on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did they get him to locate him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
"I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his file," Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of getting 365 billion
The government ministers of the Czech Republic yesterday signed with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can achieve EUR 14 billion (approximately 365 billion kronor).
This is practically half the total sum that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion kronor will come out of seven operational programmes for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kronor from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22% of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state transport infrastructure fund, which next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion kronor.
The Business and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should secure funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As regards the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly entered countries that use them the least.
A sentence of twenty years for the former president of Nicaragua, decreed the court
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday decreed a 20-year sentence for the country's former president, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of the embezzle of $100 billion (nearly $1.8 billion).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest on his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropili.
It is not at all clear at the moment, according to the AP agency that, the then head of central American state between 1197 and 2002, is back behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, will depend rather on the prison officers if they let German finish his punishment at home or if they bring him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how German constantly transferred government money to a company's account in Pánama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supportersT.
Some of this money ended up in the fund that German created to fund his campaign in the 2001 election.
That's how they approved our budget.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drawn up by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without opposition support.
This year's budget has already been approved with the support of SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and SSD could not be allowed not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, at this traditional hearing, although the most influential, quietly approved the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Each government starts and ends with every chapter and budget item, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics, but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and is why they devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State Budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three defects which for this year of 2008 cannot be so easily solved:
The first is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as the expenses of the representatives who are not only pensions but also the social benefits that were approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of SSD and KS-M.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit in public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not found in the deficit of the State Budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors, in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from money from taxes, fees and credits from banks, often issued, without meaning, obligations with which they disproportionately indebted their municipalities.
In recent years they managed to repay these debts through the massive sale of energy stocks and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we follow only official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, a few years ago, goes through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, which is boasted by SSD.
This was the ideal opportunity for his government to put state finances in order.
Instead, however, the state continued to become indebted.
The other countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to nations that are less threatened by poverty within global measures.
That is why massive social programmes that, unfortunately, in recent years have not been fussed with gigantic measures are not necessary.
And while they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist expenditures approved this year before the election, if the retirement age and pension reform soon change, then it will be the end really of any policy in this country, and, whoever rules, it will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little bit we can say that the politicians who govern will become civil servants, mechanical delivery men for most of the money from taxes for retirement and social benefits.
That's why this year's budget can't be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal spending on the mandates' expenses.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government had not wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We do not want the politicians who govern to become only officials so we must be patient and give this weak coalition of the government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to obtain from taxes and fees, the peace of mind for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks decided to fight the finance market crisis together.
In the Monetary Marking, more than one hundred billion dollars will be received through tenders.
In these tenders banks auction the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send forty billion dollars to tender, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by central banks in Europe and Switzerland.
After the 9/11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks in different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and lessen the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continued growth in free capital shortages that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report.
"This coordinated action by central banks likely reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent sixty billion dollars on unpaid credit, especially in the United States.
Economists are still expecting billions in losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what awaits them even when they decided to take this step," said ABN Amro's chief economist, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems with access to loans and will therefore have to lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the global economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, a London interbank tariff used for lending money on the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly fearing money being lent even as central banks in the US, Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another interest rate drop," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters agency Greg Salvaggio.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks helps to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the us housing market.
Klaus: Environmentalist debates are unbelievable
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed himself on the problem of global warming.
Criticism now emerged with the closure of the UN international climate change conference in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Azúl, not a green planet, he commented that the environmentalists' debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
"There the debates are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for solving the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this topic is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because as he said "many times I only encounter the caricature of my ideas".
Interested parties can now learn about their various opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement among scientists about global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor do they represent potential disasters, and that attempts to influence climate development are futile , ineffective and costly unacceptable.
Moreover, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
To the questions of those present he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental militants who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people couldn't change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the date and therefore did not change their old driver's license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request change so that officials will give them time until the end of the year to issue the new LICENSE.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year's Eve hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without a valid license.
According to traffic, the license has not been changed mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of cards, the offices of the metropolis are full of applications and interest in the new card has increased.
The City Council estimates around 2,000 daily customers.
A half hour is expected in the queues.
Around 140,000 drivers have not yet been taken out in Prague.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card within five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred kronor.
Drivers who must change their license and do not reach the end of the year, but will hit the roads without a valid license will be fined from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand kronor.
The policeman can arrange the violation with a warning.
In the event of an administrative infringement, the fine will amount to 2,500 kronor.
According to the above information, a person who is not going anywhere may be fined.
They could presumably pay up to 30, 000 kronor.
The Ministry appealed to offices to moderately enter fines of a thousand kronor, at most.
According to transport ministry member Karel Hanzelka, fines of a thousand kronor don't threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver's license is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the ID card that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should give up their driver's license.
Simply bring it or send it by registered mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the licenses issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of driver's license.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, these are about 2.6 million more documents.
Court cut sentence for Berdych's accomplice detectives
The ex-trials Josef Opava and Petr Kosaík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided as a final maturity to reduce the sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
Detectives in the department of organized crime were initially going to get between the age of 14 and 12.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only through revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case indicted, but he is first awaited by the court's verdict.
Despite this in other processes he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation in the 19-person heist and the high court today overturned 16 of them.
Most of the defendants' accusations were rejected by the investigation because they were fabricated causes.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up robberies, and helped criminal group members avoid penalties.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their robbery to Opava and Kosaík.
The indictment relates to criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
When it comes to theft, their victims suffered serious health impacts but are also charged with abuse of power as public agents and without weapons permits.
In the home register, police found pistols, steel-core ammunition, a laser directer and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the prosecution, stole tens of millions of kronor from them.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this process, the court has already convicted Berdych and others indicted guilty.
Other men related to berdych's case are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
For now, tomá's P't and Maro-Aulej, who have avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
An account for changing children: 12 million
For changing children in the Maternity House, the lawyer for the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants 12 million kronor of compensation from the hospital in T.E.B. plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondsej Dostál, does not in principle agree with Veleba's proposal.
"Such a demand is not approved, it is too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counterproposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty had investigated.
We'll find out if it has a reactionary value.
We remain in the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 kronor for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jablo's family wanted, for each month, that they did not raise their biological daughter, a million kronor.
Velaba served as the basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was prepared at the Motol Faculty Hospital in Prague.
The girls' parents according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stressful situation was better endured by men although they fought with recriminations over the change of girls.
Women carry it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with regard to what happens today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were traded by the nurses at the Maternity House of T.Ebi. on the year passed, on the nineth of December.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Eermakovs to the towns of Peibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Broo and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo.
The governor of Vyso-ina, Milo-Vystrsil, gave each family 100,000 kronor at the end of October as compensation expenses for the mistake made at the hospital in the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they should extract from the reserve fund and extraordinarily they can ask the administrator for help.
The court to this day awarded them proportionately low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and effortlessly of one million kronor.
Polyvka lost the kingdom of Lakia
Bolek Polyvka lost the lawsuit over the Brand Kingdom of Lakia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava he was the first to use the brand name Kingdom of Laquia but the project was created for many years by Tomá-Harabio with whom the actor collaborated.
Polyvka did not show up at the oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabi and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the process.
For him, in the face of the words Kingdom of Lakia, everyone comes with the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea also has Harabi.
"We've been after us for about ten years of work.
Searching for money and inventing activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that is why I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the brand name Kingdom of Lakia was first used by Polyvka in its television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat.
So it wasn't about orienting it towards the creation of a fictional kingdom.
A few years later Harabio came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Laquia.
From that comical origin it turned out to be a lucrative business and business of which Harabio later created the society Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polyvka agreed to the use of his name and signature on passports and even offered his holders discounts to his farm's viewers and show-goers.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabio only used a simple idea that Polyvka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polyvka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Lakia," she said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project there was Harabi and his team who devoted themselves to it entirely.
The collaboration, between the now broken parts, continued until 2000 when Harabio organized for Polívka the official coronation in Vsetín.
From that moment on, conflicts began between Polyvka and Harabi, the culmination of which came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the chosen one forever".
The leading role in the kingdom, through Harabi, resulted in singer Jarmila Ouláková as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an indictment against Harabia and his society which to this day has been rejected by the court.
One thing in clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which Harabi is already preparing.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to reveal any more data or dates.
"We have no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polyvka can introduce himself," Harabi added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
To tell you the truth, I've never liked the Peugeotu 206 too much.
Its gear characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is its successor on the market, the Peugeot 207, and this one, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and I have only better thought about it.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five-door, I complained, for example, about the headboard space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the bodywork of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer before two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I pass inside quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would value the invention of design more although the car already seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike the 206 model, the side steering has improved considerably.
And the space, and here you can feel how the body measurements have grown.
In the Combi disappears the aforementioned scarcity of space in the header.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
This I must value it as very accessible (thanks to the folding tailgate) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not disturb, and can be extended to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the morgue.
According to the tables, under the basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the .koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot lags behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On vacation abroad or when placing the child's stroller its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must quote the floor that is quite flat after lowering the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our automotive test was equipped with a four-valve injection ceding over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, that's how it should look like a 1600 who belittled the relative five doors.
It is quiet, consumes little and above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the Koda of that time that it looked as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that with this one I may be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, take into account that we have tested a vehicle elegantly equipped and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 kronor, you can still.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 kronor, which is already too much.
The premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 kronor.
Only we would still have airbags in the headboards, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything costs 531,900 kronor.
That's a lot, but count on the team's add-ons at the Fabia and it will reach a fairly similar number.
Now all that remains is to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
Children from eastern European countries attend English schools, which is why locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between migrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between slovak natives and migrants begin to grow.
Discussions, twisting and broncas between students have already caught up with even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was hitting a ten-year-old student with a green stick stick.
In his defense he said the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
Police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak migrant.
The girls treated him with racist slurs and threw rocks at him.
"When we were going home, a boy came up to us at the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to leave him, he made us the in addition to throwing apples and pears at us, and then he pulled down his pants and showed us his ass," he described another nasty incident for The Times, the Slovak student's mother.
Complaints are from both parties.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with eastern European migrants as fighting for survival.
The cases mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools is beginning to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For the sighters it's really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean Sea island you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island does it find even more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
In the time of the Spaniards, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called her, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port for the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional grew in the late 1920s.
He had him built by one of the bosses of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, as everything that was criminal in the US (and therefore banned) was welcome and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings emerged, by wide avenues ran the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought himself a hacienda in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita left their signatures the stars of show business and politicians from all over America.
And today?
On the walls of the Lebanese Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you will be mixed with cocktails according to your wishes.
And those already cult cars of the 50's, until today continue to operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have rusted in these wet and salty winds.
Even as Havana, especially the old quarter, deteriorates markedly, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surrounding area as there.
Other places are metamorphose in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money needed, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels grew not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguin province and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and that is highly valued by railway lovers.
Sugarcane is transported from immense plantations to sugar factories by narrow roads in steam or electric machines.
Their garages for tens of years were not discovered and are now there, machines that work and whose sister models are in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for most sighters does not change.
And for this reason, it is not necessary to talk about Havana or Varadero anymore.
Perhaps, just remember that in hemingway's aforementioned hacienda there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, they should not fail to visit it.
The Valley of Viñales is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows on limestone lands.
Mogotes, limestone pylons and rocks of high steepness in the fallen of the valley, and in their caves are acclimatized fertile lands thanks to which rocks form that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where the highest quality tobacco is probably grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the cigar habaneras factories you can find your final product.
Maybe someone finds it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was filmed there.
Trinidad
City of old abolengo that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by French settlers later, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is such a secluded place that even in the 50s of the last century there was no road linking it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for every person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth knowing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Ancón Beach or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it to be the most beautiful on the island.
That view is certainly already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that reach there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as by a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been registered as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its untouched nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (it is actually a cross that arrived 100 years later of the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Anvil.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Copper Charity, the Santeria, African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, all of which could be filled many pages.
However, as they say, it is better to see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is influencing the mission's march in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defense Minister Robert gates, should devise a concrete plan for the coming years.
Mison in Afghanistan is not working as thought, representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert gates, encouraged NATO forces to increase activity, Britain sees as a priority strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and the sharing of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the public that they alone can start economic and security development," defense minister Des Browne told THE BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to American army data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to last year by 27 per cent, and helmand Province by up to 60 per cent.
NATO countries have around 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which a quarter are in the south of the territory.
For the United States, however, allies have reached the same limit in terms of unit organization and equipment.
Exactly ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts pra train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
"I am not glad to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told the Reuters agency at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries that have been assistant in recent months, the controversy of whether all allies make the most of it in Afghanistan prevails.
By liability he was criticized, for example, Germany.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the fighting demands there are not as high as ours, in the southern and east part of the country," Gates said.
The tabloid Sun newspaper, this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan rebels discover that Germans play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where british troops played a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt to reach trillionth in 2009
For every Czech the state owes 84,000 kronor.
Total debt amounted in September to 842.7 billion kronor.
This year the government planned to lend 159.2 billion kronor.
However, in early December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kronor thanks to improved developments in the state budget economy.
The Czech Republic's state debt grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion kronor.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion kronor.
However, 13.4 billion kronor has declined since June.
Thus today, the Ministry of economy confirmed its data on state debt in early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 kronor.
Throughout last year the state was in debt with more than 111 million kronor.
"For now it seems that thanks to next year's low deficit we could cross the trillion-kronor border until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between $900 billion and trillion kronor," iHNed.cz, Patria Finance economist David Marek, said for server.
Similarly, next Finance economist Vladimír Pikora sees it: "We could spend the billionth in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political scene were seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But I don't see such a change," he added.
Doubt grows
State debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
State debt is paid through treasury bonds, state bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal indebtedness grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kronor.
Foreign debt for now has grown from 1.7 billion kronor to 123.3 billion kronor.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z kronor since June fell by 13.7 billion kronor.
The average maturity of government debt increased by 6.5 years.
"Total year-on-year debt from the first to third quarters grew by 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
Interestingly, growth is generated mostly from obligations where there is 20% growth.
It's bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that it's going to be negotiated until there's a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
The state's debt management and payments strategy for 2007 shows that the government planned to lend 159.2 billion kronor this year.
In early December, the ministry decreased the plan by 152.8 billion kronor thanks to improved developments in the state budget.
The amount is mainly made up of the deficit of the state budget which this year will be 76 million kronor in vey of the expected 91.3 billion kronor.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13.3 billion kronor, the reserve of 10 billion kronor for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kronor to finance state bonds and 1.8 billion kronor in payments of loans from the European investment bank.
I was comparing jartuum in front of a court today to have given a teddy bear a name
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insult to Islam has been sentenced thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British was accused of having let pupils 6 to 7 years old give Mahomet the name to a teddy bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
He was a pain in the ass.
This 54-year-old British school teacher, based at Unity High School in Khartoum in Sudan, has been arrested On Sunday at home and indicted with an attack on Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the stuffed bear in the class.
"Eight names come out of the mouths of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself - himself bore no label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons's Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting towards a religious faith, "I'm sorry only that he asked the children to vote for a name," according to him only a "innocent mistake."
Opinion divided by numerous schoolteacher students who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never speaks of religion in class."
Let us remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name I often choose for Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child in a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo have ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final session of discussions without having been able to overcome their divergences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach agreement on the statute," european mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "at stake," his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, called for Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
"We do not forese violence for now but enter a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist."
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troica, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go to Serbia and Kosovo one last time on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
Baden's discussions, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troica was in charge of further mediation by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on a persecution of the negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve it on its behalf.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced Kosovo's autonomous authority president Fatmir Sejdiu at the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his sorrows.
But he added that the plane of autonomy presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered for his part that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade says particularly fear a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the 1990s wars of independence.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto right.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the final say "
"Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have started: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the statute", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made "in concert" with the Westerners.
Bush rips off Israeli-Palestinian deal
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference meeting by himself Tuesday to Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately open negotiations in order to find a definitive regulation of the 60-year-old disputed point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush declared, recalling both sides of their obligations regarding the peace route they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues."
This name highlights the three main problems at the point at issue between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the American president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "global and deepened" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things."
Climbing on his return to the rostrum, Olmert pledged to what the upcoming negotiations are "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008."
Bush set the end of the launch of his "vision of two coexisting Palestinian and Israeli" states at the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had secured an endeavor in this regard from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plane, ended by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in Middle Eastern history, particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saoud says in his regular Arab interview with Saudi capitals.
For the solicitor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just as every time in such events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspection of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was driving on Sunday, shortly after 17, Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"I wasn't in intervention but on patrol, and I was driving at 40-50 km/h, with no rotating headlight," explains a police source.
A Green Motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "not approved, i.e. not authorized to drive on public roads" (read below) and driven by two young men without helmets, circulated "at full gas".
"He chased the police car on the left side, after a breach of the blind step right," the police said.
Blood alcohol control on the occupants of the vehicle was revealed negative.
The condition of the car (the front unphoned, windshield cracked, bumper ripped off) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the solicitor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérére de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for "acts of involuntary manslaughter and denial of assistance" to the IGPN, co-governed by Val-d'Oise's departmental directorate of public safety.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the solicitor states that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate three witnesses to the accident, understood sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the policemen, namely that this minibikecyclet arrived relatively quickly to his left."
Yesterday, a type of slot, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the panties on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been stuck in time for the police car to slow down.
The vehicles have been shipped and will be the subject of a technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated rapidly over Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen would have left the site very quickly, thus not providing relief to both young men.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also set aside "any serious misconduct" on this point.
"It's the most difficult aspect of research, which needs more research, which you have to be very cautious about," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness from these moments that have followed the accident.
One of its windows that precisely overlooks the scene.
"We went down right away, with my cousin who's a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them," this witness says.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw "a completely unscathed policeman, limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young men, the room was on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, to the certainty that people had present of the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen have been taken by car by colleagues who had leggano on the site.
Always according to this witness, the relief came "about twenty minutes after the police march."
They also had cardiac massages, to no ava sorry.
"I will not assume that the police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young men have been helped.
Firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them, " stressed the solicitor.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore in the east of the country, nearly 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against emergency measures have been injured by tear grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stone shots, injuring cops.
At least 350 lawyers have been challenged.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers charged and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been challenged.
To Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers required a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, man's rights militants and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement on Monday collected the support of religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president "urged the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and the waste to which they took an oath before Musharraf."
" Musharraf's promise no longer fulfills "
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
It had to rule in the coming days on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election to the presidential election on 6 October to indirect suffrage.
Court President Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court rulings," the magistrate told The News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president "no longer valued" after the establishment of the state of emergency, he told Assistant Information Minister Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy head of the armies.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, more than one pregnancy out of three (36%) it is not planned, it reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Different methods of contraception such as pill or sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception nevertheless allowed for a better "fertility mastery," according to the institute that the rate of pill use among women in their 20s and 44s is over 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less a month for a couple out of five and if possible for spring, season judged as the nicest to have a child.
Spectacular repair over the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of work in space for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his International Space Station (ISS) crewmates to perform spectacular repair of a torn solar panel indispensable for the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that amassed the records because of their duration, their departure from the habitable modules, the speed with which she has been imagined, instruments "sloppy" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday then that the astronauts had released from the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a thick cylindrical piece responsible for soon hosting European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see framing).
This module is a type of landing platform for modules-laboratories.
But you have to be able to provide them in electricity.
The crew's second task was therefore to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After displacing him, the crew began reorganizing the module's solar panels that have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which are deployed as accordions, has been damaged in just over a metre by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to damage the panel anymore.
The astronauts, who had at first perform a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go snailing at the end of the 30 meters in length of the shuttle's remote control arm added to that of the station for repair.
He's one of Nasa's best spacewalker.
Tall, sturdy, very skilful, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training physician has been in charge of "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After precisely inspecting the damage, he sectioned the fallible cable and installed types of "tablets" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second "spacewalker" who had stayed near the airlock and, inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a hockey mini-coat wrapped with insulator to prevent electrocution in solar panels producing several hundred volts, has been conceived and "sloppy" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before inventorying his instruments and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a midday off before seven astronauts returned from the Discovery shuttle today for Wednesday's scheduled return to Earth.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
The EADS action is currently in sharp descent to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently to the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to delays resulting from the slow progression of engine development of the A400M, which conditions the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay in delivering the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the mother house of the European builder EADS.
Because of these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result objectives (EBIT) by 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adding without any more encrypted accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be remembered that the operational result of EADS failed at 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads linked to delays in another programme, that of the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group envisaged a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Choosing the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, on the way out of the polls: the Russians are going to be a massive choice for President Poutine's party, Russia united.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, including authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today addresses to voters a televised message about public media, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealed to be crushing.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent by welcoming foreign ambassadors, content to hand over a new charge against the West accused of interference - his theme of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incident," he added.
According to the opposition, we're a long way from the truth.
Report a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there is "never ever had such dirty choices, even in the time of Eltsin."
After the crackdown on last weekend's demonstrations, former jaque world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, is prohibited from visiting according to his lawyer.
" The Russians kept the mindset of homo sovieticus "
Behind these uns surprised legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Poutine in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russia party that would elegy the government and the president?
Whatever it is, to legislative elections like presidential elections, outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mindset of homo sovieticus, they don't feel like they own their fate," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
The historian Nikola Kopossov, of st. Petersburg State University, goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine restored the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "renounce of their own free will the personal responsibility" of those who had briefly tested after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon touches all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, they won't vote for extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: "Why reflect?
Aren't those in power too bad, why change them? "
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidential character, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, describing the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archive documents, stored on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far consultable only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his successors.
The eleven states in charge of their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to seekers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow searches "particularly on the displacement of prisoniers, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominative documents, odd to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the supposed homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the countrymen deported or subjected to compulsory work and, possibly, to provide proof of their detention, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are dealing with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Search Centre on Anti-Semitism at the Technische University in Berlin, said in 2006.
European Union and India want to reach free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches around 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said.
The European Union's foreign ministers had last April given their approval to the European Commission to begin negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (LEEs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches around 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the European Union's 9th trading partner, according to Figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade agreement will do a lot of doping both economies" and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services," Dani-le Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, said this week, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential." The European Union and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about easing the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds to the base rate of 5.75% in five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight by the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to provide a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning December 6 in the form of an open market operation for five weeks," he says in a statement.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market as well on 6 December at 12h 15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
It is the first time it seems that the Inglaterro BoE bank puts on the market liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it "is prepared to take other steps to keep the "interbank loan" indices up to date in line with its base index.
The daily interbank index was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set to 6.6%, highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to some rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the change in the pound in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny consideration of PS party propositions on purchasing power
The UMP group and Nouveau Centre refused on Thursday to discuss articles in the socialist law proposal on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Registered in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the national PS office including the 50% increase in overshoote for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP (internal rate per petroleum products), a cheque-transport or rental restrictions.
Since UMP and NC voted against the examination of articles (180 voices vs. 115), the session was adjourned at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS MPs leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumours about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
"For our company, it's an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more or less, the current festival movement in America," Charlie Jones confided from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces chicago's Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival would take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Another time known under the name Mean Fiddler, Republic Festival director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park at Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been in charge of the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as "most inspiring event" he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we stagnate in low-level politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones is pursuing.
"Fortunately, we were able to argue with Melvin Benn and prepared to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately lead to Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, having been unmarked in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, while ours are held rather in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, one way or another, both formulas to give at the same time an impression of country festival in the European and urban way in the American way. "
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are quite interesting to allow us to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer of this festival is "very large", in the example of the 80,000 people of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
"Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 teammates, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.:
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to draw Hollywood movie dishes to Montreal when nothing else Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate functions.
A mandate -- "politically difficult" because California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runaway productions."
Is it hard to compete with the "Governator"?
"You have to be cautious, it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he's going to go there.
Our role is to offer the ones that will judge the best," he says.
The race to festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is nonetheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oskares is started.
All West Coast festivals, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle, or San Francisco, will need to present the Quebeque films, give them courage, and make sure the performers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented to the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the billboard for Santa Monica and will be presented to the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a New Year's Eve rally on the stock exchange? Experts, divided by 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks to say goodbye to the end of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional New Year's Eve rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this will be produced.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange tends to have positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainties lurk in markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the bag limping in the last weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, ready to invest given the lack of guaranteed alternatives, especially fixed income, affected by the effect fled to quality values in both long and short tranches".
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have rather lateral behavior, not without volatility "especially since the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulus from inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture out and say there will be a rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," the expert says.
Ibex has lost about 4% since the highs set on 8 November when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Still, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the Constitution Bridge.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, values that we are close to technical levels and "therefore we could see a rebound in the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analyst hopes these are positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will take ibex to new heights.
Solana, of Intermoney, states that "this year it is the great values."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some construction companies "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco ensures that the climbs will come from banking and the industrial sector.
Builders can also benefit from this rally, if given.
"ACS has been regaining positions for several months and we expect other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC to follow the same path," explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the holiday sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological ones will also do very well although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a bearish month.
The real new year-end rally was experienced in 2003, an exercise in which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered by 28.17%, December recorded an uptick of 6.68%.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of winnings (at the moment Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its year-end rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate much of its offices.
In total 200, those located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to make the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20.30pm, and open on Saturdays from 10 hours to 20.30pm.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of their offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not the public.
The results of Popular's experience will be decisive for other entities to sign up for this initiative that supports trade schedules.
This is precisely the objective that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to SMEs, freelancers and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
To do this, the entity will modernize the branches that it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers of the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
Commercial banking manager Angel Rivera says this restructuring is not a big investment, albeit a greater recruitment of staff, since it goes from having about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
Offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, angel river explains.
The branches of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets in Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that with success, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 operating under the Mundocredit brand, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax locations they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' Rivero says.
So far, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco folds the stock market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We've done it.'
With that phrase he expressed his satisfaction yesterday Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the close of the market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: 'it's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we've gone down less,' he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a 2.54% advance.
That gain puts your loss in what we've been in the year at 15.66%.
The exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulates a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Hurry (five-day editor) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we monetize it in terms of audience.'
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television network to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenue, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
If this announced data were made real, the television network would record a 3.6% increase in its advertising turnover compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the financial year (to reach 734.4 million) while net television revenue grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors pointed out by analysts for the best relative evolution in The Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that although it is too early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to leave our shareholders happy, who we have already given value to with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market currently shows some tiredness.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
This is because it has cut projected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same firm has lowered Antena 3's profit forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities based mostly on their high dividend return and long-term potential sustainable.
2.
Caja Madrid: see Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antena 3 (keep) by the 'attractive multiples' and business hike.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends underpondering in both cases by having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary process, which ended today with Congress' vote on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of both going into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activity of entities to make markets work efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Law, involves the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will enable financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal entities and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory firms (AFI), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of operations on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep track of all transactions they carry out, in order to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In his time on the Congressional Economics Committee, a number of amendments were incorporated, including that securitised debts be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high investor hazard, which has been demonstrated by the debt of US subprime mortgages.
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally define the functions that graduates can perform in Economics and Business 30 years after the real decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists was adopted in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work as an employee, will not require authorization from the CNMV and will be able to provide its product marketing and customer acquisition services to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases five tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a preview of how prices evolved in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to data produced in the United States.
The forward indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modeling methods to estimate the information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the forward indicator was for guidance only, so it did not necessarily have to match the final data, which would be released on 14 December.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the 4.1% increase in CPI in November is a "temporary figure," but at the same time has augured that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of Congress that "even if the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," the Economy Minister acknowledged against the data advanced today.
Virgin plans to raise 42 billion euros with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At the time he amassed record deposits of more than 25 billion pounds, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months because of the distrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of one hundred percent of that money offered by the government and which it will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to capture about a quarter of the revenue in British banks that are deposited over the next three years to achieve that remaining 18 billion pounds to reach the $30 billion target.
Tycoon Richard Branson's group, known for its eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin consortium offer, involving three other companies, as his favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Guardia Civil has arrested the current mayor of the Municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) earlier this morning because of his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the council secretaries of the consistory and the police chief of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales last May, the current popular deputy, and until then ruler of the municipality, and who according to sources of research consulted by Cadena SER, could be the 'head' of this plot.
Agents continue to search municipal units and urban planning counseling and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the plot of urban corruption uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore detained leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the purpose of the investigation, according to the sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in detention.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if the
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to top toledo's PSOE list for the next general election and to be president of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general election.
This has been announced at a press conference by the Secretary of organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he held this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he noted that "it does seem" that the Manchego politician will be the socialist group's candidate to preside over Congress if the Socialists win in the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín, who made public on November 15th his decision not to run for the next general election and to give up his career in active politics to devote himself to combating climate change at the university level.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the government has continued to insist that he return to the political avant-garde since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that, just as citizens know who the economic vice president will be if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce who will preside over Congress, in an "act of transparency."
If he reaches office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not insult or screaming." and make it "more and more like citizens."
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk quietly and calmly is Congress, the president of the government was once interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good work" and has no longer wanted to see himself taking up his post so as not to fall into what he has pointed out, his adversaries might see as "prepotence".
Climate propaganda
As the anti-climate change movement subjects both skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles to fearless persecution, it is bound to show iron coherence.
And more of a leader of the movement who is president of the government as a Shoemaker and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach forces him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain's lead the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance, in which sectors it has occurred and why its government, that of the contract with the planet, has not prevented it.
In addition, it requires the Spaniards to explain with the utmost clarity what steps they will take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected, what citizen habits should be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to do, what economic consequences it will have.
I mean, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there have neither been nor will there be those explanations.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the gas cent suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
I mean, it's about saving the planet with nothingness, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of all real consequences.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not intend us to cycle or cool off with the fan.
Detained by the mayor and the head of the local Police of Totana for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hospitality entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, have today reported sources of the investigation.
The building was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose premises he is currently located with numerous agents, who have also come to the Council of Urban planning and the municipal company of management of Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable so that the Galician company Nuaria built 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs the 1st Court of Totana.
The first six detainees made it to justice today.
As reported by the sources, the former ruler of Totana and now an autonomic MP of the PP, Juan Morales, is under investigation.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former counciler, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency integrated in the aforementioned Group, and through which bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Guardia Civil, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven registrations, most in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, in particular the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were requalified and its project would mean doubling the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate development; Conycase, which manages the Bourgeois car parks of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico square; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; It preconizes, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (by the way at the head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the same day that criticism of Blackburn's book appeared there curiously:
"The content of the philosophy signature has leapt into public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Counselor in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the mandatory basic course of Philosophy in institutes."

A colleague passes information on the introduction to the Criminal Code of crimes on Internet downloads:
To. Downloading a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to a year.
On the other hand, if you steal discs worth less than EUR 400 in the store, it is considered simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros in the store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still less than that imposed on the download (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the unloading (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous quarrel has a sentence of three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would be worth six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the authorization of authors is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone's getting out of hand, a very long hand.

My GP took away one of his articles on rare research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less.'
That is, the feelings generated by workers' monthly pay depends on what the peers earn.
The study has been conducted using tomographic MRIs at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "Strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The researchers observed that if when both were right they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received twice as much, the activation was higher.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Balkan prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly chasing Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecutor's office of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died - former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on that list from which the documentary by the Swiss filmmaker Marcel Schopbach takes its title, 'The List of Carla' (2006, not released in Spain) which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fleeing criminals and pressure the governments involved to narrow the fence.
What insurance suits me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be secured or the use of it, among others.
Having the car is just the beginning.
And it is that choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all you have to be clear about what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment materializes in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be secured or the use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the more likely they are to suffer an accident, the higher the fee to be paid.
That's why both over-25s and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower accident rate because of their prudence.
Also, by taking care of the recounts, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, thereby affecting the likelihood of some kind of mishap.
Increasing the frequency increases the odds.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
That is why the driver has to study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that the insurance, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 encounter various drawbacks when it comes to taking out insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the age of the card.
While it's ideal for being well insured, it's all-risk insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for a franchised risk, so that they get insurance coverage at all risk but at a more feasible price.
This type of agreement would mean that the customer pays a portion of the claim amount.
"The part of the amount of the claim provided by the customer will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, first Europe's head of Spain, an online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not those caused in their own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A tip.
If you are under the age of 25 try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, as this will have an impact on the bonus, being able to reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that base fee.
"Bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses," says Noguera.
After the 25-year-old range, drivers have it easier to take out insurance, as the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to hire a whole risk with franchise.
"Normally young people cannot make use of the experience previously gained when it comes to using an accident, and even when driving," says the European company's director in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children it is preferable that he negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation allows him, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the public with the lowest accident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risk with excess (this may be 300 euros), or, where a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to afford to take on a larger amount of excess," says Luis Noguera.
For retirees it is advisable to have all-risk insurance with excess (this being 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is an important thing, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us best according to our personal situation.
Celtic looks in Milan for a point worth the eighth
Milan and Celtic are measured on Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to condemn their classification.
The Italians add up to ten points and have already certified in the fifth round their pass with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that Shakhtar, with six, and who receives Benfica, who has four, does not go ahead.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan have to play in the Club World Cup in Japan, where he debuts on the 13th in the semi-finals in search of a place for the final of the 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie at Giuseppe Meazza seems like the most anticipated result, although the two teams will try to go out for a win, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would come first and ensure a better crossing in the eighth.
Gordon Strachan's outfit could even be ranked if Shakhtar does not win, but cannot be trusted because at equal nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to sour the night for the Scots, who hope to get into the champions for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after being precisely defeated in that round last round with a goal by Kaka in overtime (1-0) after 0-0 of the first leg.
Waiting for the victory of the Rossoneri will be the Shakhtar who is only worth the win, in case he loses Celtic, both to get into eighths and to remain in UEFA.
Benfica, despite being last and with no options to continue in the maximum European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first spice girls tour concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) stated shortly before starting their concert at Vancouver's GM Place Stadium that the group's reunion is "brilliant".
About 20,000 people sold out tickets to witness the concert that included a video recounting the story of the group that raged in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls took to the stage wearing bracelets given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowds crowding GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had been banned days earlier.
In the preview of the show's start, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star "hasn't seen our wardrobe at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been fixed and we love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines aircraft.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies awaited you.
Seven children add up to five o'clock.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California, USA, San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will perform on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases russia's risk of affecting Russia's export of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every friction between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopoly gas owner Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine was to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it will charge Ukraine more, as Ukraine has pledged to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say Ukraine could pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told reuters news agency.
"Changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [towards Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "must prove foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor criminal records of employees outside Europe, a watchdog said.
Auditor-General Robert Black's recommendation came after a foreign doctor was found to be related to the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no accurate idea of how many foreign personnel it has.
However, his report noted other checks that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European economic area, following attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep crashed at the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bombings in the UK.
NHS hopes to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates to ensure they meet qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although Scotland's health board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The auditor-general's report recommends, among other measures, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal checks in many countries outside Britain.
"While we found some of the personal records with evidence of these checks, this is not a routine review," the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS staff."
BMA Scotland President Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work at NHS Scotland but it is unclear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he explained.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because the boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely complied with.
This includes passport checks, work permits and qualifications check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide of foreigners in the NHS.
Health secretary Nicola Sturgeon says: "I was very interested in this work being carried out in the wake of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this would be reflected in updating the pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - what they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates in film awards
Control, the biographical film about late Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the Award for Best Picture.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was cast as Curtis, director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller "Notes of a Scandal".
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the variety award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - featuring soundtracks by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced at just 3,000 pounds.
But Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2's album Joshua Tree, awarded two awards- for Best Director and Best Debutante Director, also won.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning at the ceremony - such as Julien Temple's film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, won the Award for Best Documentary.
The Best Actor award was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as chauffeur of a Russian Mafia boss in London, in David Cronenberg's film Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fifler, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named after Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard HArris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, he's really an honor."
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 militants of terrorist cells planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world's largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda supporters have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents planned an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the television report stated.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world's largest oil plant, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert," who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned the smuggling of eight projectiles into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining Al-Qaeda as militants to fight allied forces and to support the Muslim Shiite government, which is considered heretic by the more extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants target many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the government-dominated royal family.
The militants - recruited by calls from Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden to harass the country's pro-Western government - targeted the residences of government-associated foreigners, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Those arrested also include a 16-person "media cell" in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sui Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of earth's future
Venus may have once been an appropriate place for life, scientists declared yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a twin on Earth than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion from solar radiation, and slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provides an overview of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission says: "It is clearing why the climate on Venus is so different from Earth's, when it is two planets so similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Policecomisa "enriched uranium"
One kilo of radioactive material, which they declare to be enriched uranium, was seizen yesterday by slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
It still stays open
Mitt Romney says it's not worthy for presidential candidates to answer a snow monkey's questions.
However, Republican candidates for the presidency eventually agree to have a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record video questions and send them for dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions presented on Wednesday afternoon, November 28, were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked Democrats about climate warming in the YouTube Republican party debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party for next year's election.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to turn up the dial when they heard ideas they liked: broadcasters noticed spikes in approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest word exchanges of the night took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the chance to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed on the issue.
Neither has the word to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both alerted the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and generally speaking, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, coupled with fear of China's toxic toys and other concerns abroad, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between Liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other topics appeared.
Mr. Guiliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations, first of all in the most recent Iowa poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed that Jesus was too intelligent to be a candidate in the elections.
The race is still unusually open.
I'm sorry. Huckabee increases in Iowa, coinciding with liberal Ron Paul's fundraising campaigns, and his heated statements from Wednesday's debate.
The two of them have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the match is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labor pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
No influences appear to have been sold, nor are they exhorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor extramarital finger-sucking.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour government party of more than 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million), for nearly four years using false names, and that the party did not denounce him.
Two months ago, when the prime minister referred to calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that he would provide strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat leads with increasing wit, because the dreaded Mr Brown has gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poverty of judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code has put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative sloppy.
A trio of retired generals started a mutiny in the House of The Lores, protesting against cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now they are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour general secretary (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they are unable to govern.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new lot takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot make things better, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government gets defensive and doesn't focus.
On the one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Even if he wanted to renege Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to Brown's decisions as chancellor of the erarium.
And even though he is not directly involved in Blairish's setbacks - or "cash for partners," investigating the financing of political parties - voters can assume that he is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
Gaffes aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been directly conned.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what the naturally Stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
I'm sorry. Abrahams, who compares his donations to gifts of charity, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but he doesn't make the decision.
Anti-anonymity laws for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those who have the power.
I'm sorry. Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Watt's agreement. Abraham, and that this one was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraiser who was asked about donations in October.
But Mr Brown so far is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these actions, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far the prime minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to convict his party for breaking the law, but he is diluted in decision-making on a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter - led to much by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
Besides, there are other things that mr. Brown must do, as he finds a permanent and independent head for the Committee on Standards in Public Life, because he has not had one for six months, and must also push for genuine reform of party funding.
This will require hard work by Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with trade unions - bitter measures for a partisan like Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Sharks cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's natural for dorsal fins to swim excitedly around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their sights set on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the underprime mortgage crisis spreads other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already visible.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or are more than 30 days behind respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million charges in its American consumer financing business, partly due to weak card borrowers.
However, it is too early for panic.
Delinquency and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, in the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost one percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in fees can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American People's Bankruptcy Act (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore delinquency) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, showing how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And confidence in credit cards and asset-backed securities is fairly strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge credit card debts now that lenders are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at liquidity flow than active securities, so falling prices do not necessarily trigger a change in borrowers' creditor capacity.
They can even work to outperg the emitters.
Incentives for consumers to continue to amortize mortgages decrease if properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card's debt goes up on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to difficult conditions as mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering creditor balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of rapid asset rework.
"We're not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Head of Finance at Capital One.
If a sudden infection of the subprime in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit crunsion push America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a harsher future.
We've got to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers convicted in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility for the frauds with former Head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were convicted on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found not guilty of seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. District, each was convicted of colution in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC at the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
Initially, charges against bankers were to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron's downfall.
The accusation against bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a Fastow-controlled Enron company, which was the architect of a run-in fraud in Enron, which helped its spiral of falling into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interest at zero, but the three Britons knew it would value on the rise.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest at $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 in interest at Kopper.
Fastow falsely portrayed Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million were left to British bankers Fastow and others.
Bankers collected $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted on two counts of conspiracy in Enron's collapse.
The trio of Britons were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was taking place.
Enron, one of the nation's seven largest companies, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their failing businesses seem successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were in charge of each other last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly straight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, Gulfstream's representative.
"But none of them ask for that model of so many seats because it's for private family flights or for company presidents."
I'm sorry. Firer was in charge of Gulfstream's booth last Friday at the Millionaire's Fair, a four-day consumer held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury vendors had installed their display stands, hoping to lure the wealthy new Russians into all kinds of products, from mahogany-coffered yachts to diamond-encrusted car grills, worth 50 cents.
I'm sorry. Firer cautiously looks at a bright orange Porsche at the stand next to yours."
"It's a beautiful car, but it's nickel and boiler compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was in full swing.
"We lived the same thing in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at Harvard University's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies.
"Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and spenders."
The world's most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below subsistence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time with the brand's Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in an afternoon suit, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Yumatova, who re-elected off the designer suit he wore as a carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum pen cutters, ice cream from Muvenpick, custom pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets of 30 euros ($44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," Mr. Gijrath, who sat patrioticly in a stand of the Dutch royal porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling."
In fact, vendors said that rich Russians of more background (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from flashy logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade show.
However, several thousand people: cash millionaires, millionaire emissaries or tourists fill the aisles every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the brilliant orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for private requirements, said he had sold three chain bracelet-shaped car grilles, for Rolls Royce Phantom, for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded in Swarovski colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel. The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
The cost: $22,000 for a set of four.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels," says Mr Karapetian.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of your Russian clients are rich, mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the wave of real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Non-millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths filled with piles of $1 million fake banknotes.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaire's Fair.
Visitors would stop to shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobiles while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Karryev says.
"Chapuza" surgery could be the cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving that Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the "A Little Healthier" restaurant and watched an ambulance go up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car showed up.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the ambulance go up, " said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that day Wednesday.
"That's when I found out someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at 212 West Scott's house.
Authorities still don't determine what caused Ms. Arroyo, but they wait for the toxicology test although the results won't be available for a few weeks. This will help solve the mysterious death he has grieving in the upper ranks of the Newark policeman.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and tenacious," mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me."
I'm sorry. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and left two 14- and 11-year-old sons and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for County Union Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine if Ms. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities, " declared Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said the house arrived about 3 P.M.
On November 21st and they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead at the site.
More than a week has passed and authorities have said little about your investigation or the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not tell if Mrs. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a withered rose bush is located at the front of the house, and a Dalmatian bark at the back.
A blue drum labeled "ethyl vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was located at the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to one side.
I'm sorry. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its tough political culture.
"She'd say, "You have to watch with this or that one, " he said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
It's embarrassing."
The federal reserve is expected to cut rates to lift the stock exchange
Stocks jumped to both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market waited for the federal reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which increased with reassuring comments from the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
The exchanges loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two ben Bernanke, chairman of the reserve, declared that policy-makingrs should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to continued financial market tension.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence was "partly reversed by the improvement in the market in late September and during October."
If the upward trend persisted, the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business would increase, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into US markets. and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the US economy. Like sales of homes that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were accentuated by a notice by Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in an overall cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, at close to 13,289.40, while the S&P 500 wide index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at close to 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of Britain's leading companies.
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of market credit stress after strong demand at a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001, was highlighted.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the action of the federal reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the stock markets in London strained the credit and rates of three-month "Libor" loans among British banks, the biggest rise since September, at 6.59%, after a steady rise since 12 November.
England takes Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara's lawsuits with trial
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the national team who is on loan - with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, director of England, is starting to fill up with offers to become a national selector, and if not, a part time.
Whoever doesn't get sixth place at bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and so is sport.
It's not easy to throw what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck without capacity.
It is not only in cricket that choice is difficult, as judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is that the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what a good level is for a cricketer, unless given the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a big influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the captain's eye at the same time as taking a wicket and a batter to get opportunities to change order if he wants to have an impact as a player one day.
But catching the eye of the recruiters is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who surely plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for fit and bowls as the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races each to earn one place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their moments high and can expect more of these.
Shah or Bopara games at Asgiriya Stadium may only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each race and did well in the first few, with 5 wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who became a player of importance, and despite scoring a hundred double against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion at today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and foster Shah's greatest experience over the exuberance of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both of us.
In Shah's favor is his brilliant and valuable early '88 debut test in Mumbai, 32 hundred first class versus only 6 from Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent antecents against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two shifts in May against West Indias in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, he seemed to have taken from his batting some of himan than in Bombay.
By contrast, Essex's team has joie de vivre on swords.
He is on fire for nothing on the cricket ground and his attitude was sued as when he dumped his vehicle in an exhibition for England's car sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate looking in the distance, to say with excitement, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he bats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not excel, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who ran out of cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I've read in the papers, about what happened in Baghdad and what's safe now."
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentary cessation.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia and a professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned to his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in his country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah phoned him to tell him that an allied US force was calling for him to take a call. The U.S. helped get Al-Qaeda out of its strong force west of the capital, and they urged him to come back.
One of Jordan's newcomers was the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe that had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad, by a grenade attack, after urged citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and needed my support and that of my colleagues."
"That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they have been drawn to the growing calm in the capital since US troops have been able to do so. The U.S. will strengthen groups of "concerned citizens," armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many claimed to have returned for visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, voiced the common suspicion among exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, called on the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people back.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian crews of death.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to iraqis, to force them back to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, easiing tension.
There are fears that a sudden wave of refugees will bring up sectarian tensions again and the fight will begin.
Little Saarland, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
As across the country, Sarlandes lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Irish man that we are not French"- that was the ironic bike about themselves from the smallest federal state for his cencuentenary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Saarland education system which in a study of the Institute of German Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" finished fifth.
In this way, higher schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrucken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day students can finish their university career here with two or three dipolmas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15, 6 per hundred.
However, the number of students from Saarland is higher than average in high schools. Many of them don't have a bacillerate.
"The Saarland takes advantage of the system of vocational education," says Axel Pl'nnecke, the education expert at the German Institute of Economics (IW).
More than five young people do their high school at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that Saarland is 7 points above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, relative to the number of populations, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences dropped by a third in recent years.
That was why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced high schools to advertise more for specialties in Engineering Sciences.
"After PISA's first study, we made some reforms in general education schools," says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
So the government introduced comparative evidence across the country.
In order for children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also mimics the other federal states.
Comparison with upcoming studies will show whether student performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of late school development pupils decreased from 29 per cent to 20 per cent.
But overall, Saarland didn't improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the chagrin of the Sarlandes, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, even if in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sarlandese are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory subject in the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chavez changes the time.
In Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez lets the schedule in the South American country change, delaying the clock by half an hour.
Chávez is currently becoming a comedian in Spain.
As the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State has reported, according to the new law, the time will be less than four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his desition by saying that the United States once imposed an obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the hostage action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would have no relationship with eer the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative Alvaro Uribe remained colombia's president.
"My dignity does not allow me to do so," says Chávez, who is pushing for constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide Sunday in a referendum.
This reform could greatly expand its power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's tenure in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in which it was about the release of the hostages.
On Sunday Chávez said criticizing that Uribe's decision has offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk in Spain about Chávez.
A new ringtone causes a feeling in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that half a million people have already downloaded.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who was annoyed by the continuing interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decrease in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong juncture.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Hans B'ckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real wage account in 2007 than the previous year.
"The blame for that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the stretching of food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Cycle Research told the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn.
The new burdens of unemployment insurance can also be on employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbruck told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrucker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% over the year is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the labour office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, in the words of a politician from the German social-democratic party.
Tuesday it became public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and the petroleum derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, they are rising by 3%.
Venus: Twin brother of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere not suitable for life, Venus is the closest planet to Earth, something that until now had not been raised. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls at the poles, which also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades now, researchers had a suspicion that lightning could exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays fall from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, cris Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles tells the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, lightning caused life on Earth: storms may have provoked reactions in the ocean that, for their part, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus it's not like that: if there were ever life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and temperatures of 500oC reign on the surface, oscillating in such a way that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Venus is possibly a "diabolical" twin on Earth, but she's still a twin," Russell said.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so Earth-like because of its mass and size, has evolved so differently.
Since there were no special missions since the 1990s, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of the research to be presented in many articles of "Nature", according to the opinion of the researchers, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
"This also proves that neighboring planets have more common characteristics with Earth than we had assumed," ESA reports.
Despite the well-known stormy winds at the North Pole, researchers discovered in the southern polar region also a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high earthly atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has the mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet also called an alba star or evening star orbits the Sun for nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and with its atmospheric pressure of 92 bar does not closely resemble Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets there had agglomerated water that on Earth stayed in the oceans, but on Venus dissote in the universe.
While carbon dioxide had become carbon stones on Earth, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between parties over Dalai Lama's reception at the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, worries about Germany's reputation and therefore demanded that the grand coalition end that fight over dalai Lama's reception.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as A divided nation," Koehler told the newspaper "Handelsblatt."
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding of Dalai Lama's reception by Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
"While I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute force to me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy meteria, stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the rebuke he received in making a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of China's politics.
China knows that too," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly expressed his displeasure at the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticised the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
Dalai Lama's reception at the Federal Chancellery led to great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the German Finance Minister, but also, according to information sources from the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Foreign Ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese head of government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception from Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians to receive the Tibetan religious leader in his official position.
Dalai Lama's actions and words showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and China's other Tibetan region, which now also includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like those in France.
Battles with police in the streets, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be riots as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move to the streets.
They barricaded the police, vandalos shot the police with rifles: after serious riots starring young people in France, the Federal Minister for Internal Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We also have to make sure that our country's social problems do not take the violent form."
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse," published in Hanover.
Not all young people develop into the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
That refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already paying off."
It's still early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that german suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The young men staged serious riots on the streets with police north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Tolouse.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of a imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Despite everything, performances are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 was above average.
We need to make sure there are more vocational training positions.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give a perspective to young people."
The president of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says: "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
Young people should be "given the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training faster."
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police officers took part in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
The authorities responsible reported three arrests, as well as rubbish and burned cars.
Since the previous day, a team of nearly 1000 police officers has been taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that police will take rigorous action until necessary.
On Monday to Tuesday night around 80 policemen were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The riot began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young men died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the youth was not because of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The action far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its last point and that nothing else should be expected of it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the lower house it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
With regard to her rebuke for repeatedly engaged in foreign policy proceedings, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial mode and thus showed that he did not want to understand what is of interest to critics.
In the lower house, it was very clearly stated to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
You couldn't feel any interest, or any kind of feeling about the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that flees in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: climate change prevention: she praised herself very much for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising herself - for two years the head of the Democratic Christian Union Party has not been able to afford so much modesty.
Well, it's about expressions to get a boost to people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going down the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, inner problems are places of little value.
Child poverty and concerns about low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about it using subordinate sentences.
It's amazing how many times you're wrong to talk when it comes to the supplement for kids.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in uncharted territory", when it came to more concrete information.
The attacks section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate over YouTube Republican presidential pre-candidates and must now fear only one foreign candidate.
From the beginning you can see the tensions between the candidates.
Mitt Romney reproached his adversary Rudy Giuliani for having turned New York into "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants."
He, for his part, responded with grave reproach: "I would like to say that his own home was a "port" for the illegals." Giuliani replies to the former ruler of Massachustes by saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: because so far the Republican group has no clear favorite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were sent to Youtube, also don't have much content.
"With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power," that was John McCain's rebuke to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one in the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from vietnam war veterans when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulate his death.
Public reactions in the hall in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that meanwhile the campaign's most important issues are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when they praised conservative values and denied the rise in taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"At the time I was wrong," Romney explains, "he wrote and apologizes to people and the television audience for being an abortion advocate in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without a uniform.
A day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
That's how the eight years of military rule in Pakistan end.
On Thursday Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan, took the oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his term as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and in this way accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he seized power with an inscrulent military coup, the former general rules the state for the first time as civilian chief.
With his resignation from the post of head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main status of the opposition and the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the oath Musharraf will soon annul the state of emergency and fulfill the second condition of the West.
Since he was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there have been many pro-Musharraf jurists. Last week the country's Supreme Court rejected all appeals before the controversial new elections of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-extension a copy of "Live 1974" was made that was written in the best time of the band.
Back then they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of them their box, their cables and above all their buttons.
In the middle sits Dieter Moebius, who is 63 years old and dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is Michael Rother, 57, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes to their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
A very exciting thing for Krautrock enthusiasts was the fact that the band Harmonia did music again.
What needs to be revealed here is this: the questions have accurately shown that the band's name rumbled in people's minds, but it wasn't so special that after 32 years the audience missed it so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially since the eritch Kautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of The 2003 Cologne band for their work of life, the surprising faces of German pop artists could be seen in the room.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Dusseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths in amazement.
Michael Rother later spent his time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and in those times I did not achieve a great effect on the audience, however, it subsequently obtained it thanks to the others.
A while ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for financial reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a time, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and later worked as a guitarist in the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that in those days was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed The Cluster musicians into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Comune I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was more like an artist's life full of surprises.
One day, an Ottenstein Harmonia singing association pennant reportedly appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages to the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just about getting to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Rother then expressed a desire to propel Harmonia and occasionally do rehearsals.
For Roedelius and Moebius this demand is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up into esoterianism and secured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and since that time has been more successful than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that's to be thanked to Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set a goal to cultivate this own German contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius's work, so did the band Neu! was again discovered.
Harmonia's performance as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There's Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade, is also present there.
In this way, all of Krautrock's influences to the following pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, she has funturous part."
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the black and white photo projections, where instruments are seen with wires.
Deep down are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but attach the microphones to the organ and battery in order to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Currently electronic music is just as it had to be.
Three people who delve into technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere she coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis she sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was already always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in the schools of music (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia remains calm.
The scenario reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does the music start and end?
That can break one's nerves or give away a few quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again devoted to war in the Balkans.
But they were both not very convinced.
Either the concepts look a lot at actions and shots or the two movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding on the Balkan mountain, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and minor roles in women's films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "The Hunting Party" when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and crazy today?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the eye: deep down, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life have already passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decline preserved until now most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
You can narrate the film "Moerderischer Frieden" in a nutty words: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not once again presented as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without a motorway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another script author (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story about American reporters in the war going to spot a war criminal Serb named "fox" could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now."
Thus, the stories are strikingly similar: small teams go to the mountain twice to carry out something that the army cannot do and each time it is a journey in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first we are introduced to Simon Hunt, whom they don't just let to be a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Bosnian Muslim who will later kill.
Then "The Hunting Party" is a long way from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters impressively achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the world's head hunters, who were capturing the war criminal and leaving the Bosnian Muslims to exact revenge, were achieved for five years.
It's so bad, it makes you want to appeal to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is actually a profonsedly human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadsei and Mladi are still free, and stresses that americans and French are not really worried about chasing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to mind a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this peoma it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the gandes wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not only the genre of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper he published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always worth a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or minefields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, "Across All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It has to be at least decades before Hollywood makes a good film about the Holocaust, taking the film "Schindler's List" as an example.
Some movies already need more time. Classics such as the works on the Vietnam War "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their day were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about global conflicts, and that is why in our day every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because script authors don't have the slightest qualms (which is necessary to be able to) in telling good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" proved so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to make a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic gaze and distant from an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lempriére" and the war in the Balkans, he replied, "That's only because some things never change."
Big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives in response the negative criticism of the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism of politics and economics for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, ceo of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said Wednesday this resignation as "not good for the economic site."
In recent times no other project in the big city fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal, political, sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded that the Senate not forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time."
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg's ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics would not take place until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but is decided by the German Federation of Olympic Sports," says von Beust at WELT ONLINE.
It referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December on Munich's application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we had until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance."
Despite everything, this dream is not over forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too early to let the opportunity go away, if plans are ruined right now," HSB Director Gonter Ploo said Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is contradictory to the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Federation of Higher Schools Sport (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for Universiades in 2015 not as "a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week did the Higher School Sports Federation appoint Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The Fraction of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bérgerschaftsfraktion) accused the Senate not to take advantage of such valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate was delaying the development of the small Grasbrook neighborhood, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, the deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required integrated Olympia planning for little Grasbrook and then the use of built homes, the CDU underscored the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's application for the 2012 Summer Olympics provoked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Brightness-Box "type" on this list are fake.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" put doubts about Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes authenticity a few months ago, Stockholm's Modern Museet Museum conducted internal research and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brightness-Boxes," which former museum director Pontus Hultén gave to the Muse Modernaet museum, are false, and nearly a hundred of the others "Stockholm type" , which are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and patriotic productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Bright-Boxes" in New York, painting the wooden boxes red, blue and white, with the same sample that they had soap powder cartons "Brightness".
According to Warhol, hundreds of Brightness-cardboard boxes were exhibited at the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet museum. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brightness" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but copies (which were only objects) on display.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden a brightness-wooden boxes, but they were not exhibited in the Modern Museet museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brightness-Boxes" of "Stockholm type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auction some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him were produced and exhibited.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmo for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Bystrom, the head of the curators of the Modern Museet Museum, investigated six Brightness-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and frosted their tight silvers and then painted them oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the tight silvers. Besides, it's not about oil painting, it's about acrylic paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol's official Gloss-Boxes list," says Lars Nittve, the director of the Moderna Museet museum, adding that if the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Commission in New York will not come to some conclusion, the Museet Modern Museum will classify these six boxes as copies/exhibits."
As early as July The Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious accusations" in which these are boxes of soap powder.
But from that moment on there everything remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
Rebel soldiers who had barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered in the Philippines.
The ringleader Antonio Trillanes, who reproaches the president for electoral corruption and fraud, told a reporter that he could not respond for spilling blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers were entrenched for a few hours in the building.
Nearly half of them, including Trillanes, had a trial Thursday for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended in a failure.

Evidently the military policemen who were to keep an eye on him had taken to their ranks and followed his mutiny.
They entered the hotel "Peninsula" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security adviser, condemned the soldiers' behavior.
"People are fed up, " said Trillanes.

The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
