What is counted? The ČSSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry shop
The new ČSSD councilors in the capital are apparently going to have to overcome the obvious language barriers in order for the members of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council to understand their renewed colleagues from the ODS.
The Aktuálně.cz period &quot;tested&quot; the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the marked slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
Mayor Pavel Bém&#39;s coded dictionary used by the political cream of Prague during the previous period includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councilors hardly understand these familiar concepts.
At least that&#39;s what they say.
&quot;Who is Voldemort?&quot;
&quot;The truth is that I do not know.&quot;
&quot;I am more of a novice in Prague politics,&quot; said Councilor for Culture Lukáš Kaucký during the &quot;collegueo&quot; terminology test.
And as for the veteran politician, Karel Březina reacted the same.
You may be familiar with the term &quot;golf hole.&quot;
&quot;Possibly the only expression of all the ones you asked me that I use from time to time.&quot;
&quot;If not, I don&#39;t normally use slang.&quot;
From the glossary, whose definitions were published by the newspaper Aktuálně.cz last June before the ODS voting congress, the editorial staff chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the concepts &quot;Voldemort&quot;, &quot;Prague&#39;s biggest golf hole&quot;, &quot;go to the bakery&quot;, &quot;nape of the bull&quot;, &quot;treason of the capital&quot; and &quot;shield&quot;.
Three councilors agreed to take the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague in the future, agreed at first, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councilor, Petr Dolínek, directly refused to do so.
&quot;I am not getting into these things and I am not going to assess how much fun civic democrats have.&quot;
&quot;What I do care is how we understand each other in the execution of our programs,&quot; he said.
As has been seen, the councilor Lukáš Kaucký allegedly did not realize that the above title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word &quot;Voldemort&quot; does not say anything; the only term that got the test right is &quot;the largest golf hole in Prague.&quot;
&quot;It is about the Blanka tunnel,&quot; says Kaucký, who immediately adds: &quot;But rather I know from the news.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m going to have to sign up for a language course,&quot; he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel on the golf hole, but also the Councilor for the Environment Lukáš Plachý.
Afterwards, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find that character; furthermore, he suspects the meaning of &quot;going to the pastry shop.&quot;
&quot;I think it means going to a company in Prague&quot;; Plachý is soon revealed to be the headquarters of the Janoušek companies.
Like Březina, he indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the test participants, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms among socio-democrats.
&quot;I asked my companions, but it really seems like we don&#39;t have anything like it.&quot;
&quot;Rather, between us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or we make puns on the names,&quot; says the president of the Prague ČSSD, Petr Hulínský, whose party colleagues call Hulda.
&quot;At school they called me Bříza, but I don&#39;t know if my classmates also call me that,&quot; confesses her own nickname Karel Březina.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper put the name to the test and it works.
To his party colleagues, Weinert is Děda (similar to &quot;yayo&quot;) or, less friendly, Dědek (&quot;old&quot;), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the elections hoaxes during the sponsorship of the party, receives the nickname of &quot;Igráček&quot; (&quot;playmobil&quot;) on the part of some of its companions.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínský does not like to be called Hulda, but the Aktuálně.cz newspaper even discovered other nicknames for this Prague president.
&quot;The baton rights doctor&quot; seems to recall that Petr Hulínský obtained his doctorate in law from the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of &quot;witches&quot;, as published in a brochure
Women considered as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are often elderly, cannot work, for example for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who &quot;become&quot; witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the town.
&quot;Men seldom suffer such fate.&quot;
&quot;Healthy young women are not isolated either, because they help with work and have children,&quot; explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state Burkina Faso, takes care of more than 100 women expelled from their communities in a special residence .
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual &quot;social measure&quot;.
It issued an information leaflet that should help prevent witch hunts.
However, this has a downside.
&quot;More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,&quot; warns the Die Standard newspaper about the disadvantages of writing awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Gana, Burkina Faso&#39;s neighboring country, Ammy Hemmah, 72, was killed last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate set of circumstances.
According to his version, the woman caught herself in the oil that is used for ritual anointing.
It was set on fire when the group wanted to &quot;drive out evil spirits&quot; from the woman.
The isolation of the &quot;witches&quot; is supported by people of all educational levels.
Der Standard newspaper quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: &quot;Eaters of human souls always posed a danger,&quot; he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government tries to quell the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president was still involved.
&quot;The Gambian president Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide hunt for the witches who, supposedly, had been related to his death and had tried to kill the president himself by means of black magic.&quot;
&quot;To help him he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president&#39;s personal escort, forcibly took men and women randomly chosen from among the Gambian peoples onto the president&#39;s property in Kanilai,&quot; he says in his report the organization Amnesty International.
At the farm, the arrested people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive their stay at the farm.
After international pressure, they finally released around a thousand detained people.
Bakala&#39;s tenant: heats himself with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The old and sturdy man walked through the doors of the customer service center of the RPG Byty company of &quot;coal magnate&quot; Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of rental flats in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried some documents with the new three-story rental contracts: his, his daughter&#39;s and his son&#39;s, who is serving sentence.
All three have just been caught by rent liberalization.
Instead of 3,500 CZK a month, the son will pay from next year 4,100 CZK for a two-room apartment with a separate second-rate kitchen.
&quot;In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler,&quot; the man shows with his finger in his son&#39;s new contract, over whose signature he has full powers.
&quot;But I signed it,&quot; he explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as &quot;incorrect and indecent&quot;, recommends tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing about how proceed in these cases.
But, faced with this, the man only makes a gesture.
&quot;Everyone says one thing,&quot; he says with a frown.
Ostrava is emerging as a large liberalization testing laboratory.
After the New Year, it will happen with the vast majority of the flats that, in the Czech Republic, were up to now under a regulated rent.
That is why Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the &quot;laboratory&quot; in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava, and by Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to take number.
&quot;Rent 2011&quot;, can be read on a light button on its touch screen.
When pressed, a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
There is hardly time to even read &quot;157&quot; and the number appears on the large screen at the top of the room.
In a second, you are in the queue.
Soon after, an elderly couple arrives to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here because of the new rents.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the old days: repair requests, insurance questions and the like.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava in the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 flats owned by RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty offers you in the letters a rent increase of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18 a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
&quot;It&#39;s been running for a week, so it&#39;s starting,&quot; the workers who are in it when the client introduces himself as a journalist respond, after a brief hesitation.
Liberalization and the former Bakala mining flats are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were discussed loud and clear by the Ostrava deputy speaker of the Parliament, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, and now they appear continuously in the newspapers in the area.
&quot;Twenty years later I want a new floor.&quot;
&quot;They didn&#39;t even change my damn bathroom plate,&quot; says the man mentioned in the introduction.
According to the workers, at the moment retirees are mostly coming to see if they receive a rent discount if they sign on time, as the RPG special offer promises.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15 will also receive half the discount on the February rent.
However, the window of mining &quot;liberalization&quot; certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
&quot;Of the 360 clients who were here yesterday, only about forty or fifty people asked about the rent in 2011,&quot; estimates the clerk at the window.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties cannot agree on the rental, an independent judge must resolve the matter.
&quot;It is not a threat, but information on the only possible way to proceed and completely in accordance with the law,&quot; RPG warns on its pages.
&quot;No one is going to be judged here&quot;, says one of the RPG Byty employees and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center agrees, at least in part, with the reason.
&quot;I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to court,&quot; he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows doubt.
&quot;We&#39;ll see&quot;.
&quot;Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people wait,&quot; he says.
Rent regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
&quot;The current rents still do not even cover the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund,&quot; recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, adding that the neglected state of the community fund is annoying to tenants is, for landlords, the main reason to increase the rent.
While during the five years that elapsed between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest four billion in apartments with rents, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen that hangs from the ceiling, in front of the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that is highlighted in red.
&quot;The rent increase in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG properties.&quot;
&quot;In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 CZK per month per square meter,&quot; is indicated on the screen.
It only increased the rent of 400 flats in RPG&#39;s portfolio by 38%.
&quot;In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts of 19.66 crowns per square meter,&quot; says RPG.
In 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not hit rents all at once, but will escalate over four to eight years.
In addition, add the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent increase (see the graph) again in the flats, mainly in savings in heating: new windows and heating.
People who sign the rent increase agreement will have priority.
The architects have understood that offices also need a nursery
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the Arch.Design company.
No one would say that it also hides a small nursery with everything that is typical of such facilities: colored walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can attend.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose studio many well-known Brno buildings emerged, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-nursery.
Around 90 people work in the company, mainly in the baby boom age and they wanted to allow the architects and draftsmen to return to work soon after motherhood.
Along with the possibility of enjoying reduced hours, the nursery is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers its employees as part of its social program.
Construction companies and architects thus have the possibility of combining a demanding profession with childcare.
The mini-nursery was the brainchild of Arch.Designu&#39;s own employees and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
The company&#39;s mini-nursery is financed through the European Social Fund within the framework of the Human Resources and Employment Operational Program, as well as the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the financing granted (an endowment of more than 2.8 million CZK) they were able to buy the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When the funding runs out (two years), Arch.Design is required to keep the mini-nursery running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the Economy Rating company contributed in the presentation of the financing request.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified personnel; Furthermore, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. The nursery currently welcomes children with no age limit, although most of them are under three years of age.
Given that it is a &quot;mini-nursery&quot;, it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is about individual teaching and care, the contents of the mini-nursery program are comparable to the usual preschool program.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality education: from basic learning to preparation for school, they even teach English.
The class not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for the children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can visit their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up children late from school when away from work.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
Not surprisingly, this naturally creates a loyal relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design ranks among the firms that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing of personnel.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudí&#39;s interiors
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur, and the balconies resemble the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its skeleton-like shape, locals nicknamed it &quot;the house of bones.&quot;
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade reminiscent of scales and the omnipresent gently curved lines, all this is typical of Antoni Gaudí&#39;s secession.
The front of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought out order are observed.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is enhanced.
It meanders and the twisting of the forms continues to surprise us also inside.
Corrugated wood copies window frames, railings, door trim, peepholes, and signs.
Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample neighborhood at number 43 on the lively shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, arose from the remodeling of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
Reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the old building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí&#39;s idea of a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, made up of various apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, ornaments for the property owner&#39;s representative apartment and mosaics used on the façade emerged from their project plans.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
Collaboration on the Casa Batlló proposals was the beginning of Jujol&#39;s successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Casa Milá and Gaudí&#39;s Güell Park, which houses other pieces of it.
Due to its organic form, locals shortly after its completion dubbed it &quot;the house of bones.&quot;
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it &quot;the house of yawns&quot;.
It is also said that, at the top of the building, appears the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motifs.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the time of central heating with ventilation vents and the typical chimneys.
Its 45 degree tilt may be strange.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect the construction regulations of the time at all and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so shocked with the result that it requested that it be correct.
It bothered him, for example, that the building included columns even down to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, quite the contrary: just fifteen days after the request of the city council, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself settled on the lower floors.
On the second floor gallery was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely traversed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí&#39;s reconstruction, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the interior patio and skylights.
The game with the two colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the sun&#39;s rays.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the largest and most ornate apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the famous creator&#39;s birth.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very profitable business and extended the visits to the common area and the loft, including the roof terrace.
The entrance price to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, pensioners and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly make friends with a resident of the neighboring houses and visit them at home.
How to choose the mattress and the box spring: women and men look for different things
No pompous frame for the bed; what really gives a good bed its quality is the surface to lie on, that is, the mattress and the bed base.
Above all, they must complement each other perfectly to suit specific users.
Numerous elements come into play during the choice, including the owner&#39;s weight, height, health, and gender.
The type of interior in which the mattress and box spring are located is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that is not typically heated, latex mattresses should not be used because they &quot;heat up&quot; more slowly.
In addition, they tend to weigh considerably more than regular polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them more frequently.
If the channels in the center are not adequately aerated and, above, they are on a firm base, they keep moisture inside. Mold can even appear underneath.
When choosing a bed, customs also play a role.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft underlay and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, harder surface.
&quot;Almost all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn&#39;t sleep as well here.&quot;
&quot;For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft memory foam layer.&quot;
&quot;This type of mattress is also recommended for people with diabetes who suffer from nervous system problems, which is why they receive poor information from the joints and the skin,&quot; explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Memory foam mattresses have long been preferred by many hockey players, as well as other customers.
&quot;Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico.&quot;
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate memory foam.
This &quot;miracle&quot; works in a very simple way.
Optimizes its stiffness and shape based on absorbed heat or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; During the night, it will not spin like after a hard game.
You just sleep better.
The memory foam also works as protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of around 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for one person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, for example single rooms, a minimum of 120-140 cm is recommended.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
&quot;If not, a simple rule can be applied to calculate the width: when lying on your back, you should keep your hands comfortably tucked towards your elbows,&quot; advises engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert from Cechu čalouníků a dekoratérů, who has been working for many years. of the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, a subject taught in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, everyone needs their own bed base and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to match the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the bed bases at different heights, which is not always possible on all beds.
The foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with interior springs a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
&quot;When you touch it with your hand or when you sit on the mattress, you should definitely not feel the springs,&quot; says Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a specific type of bed base.
Fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese twins, make no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe badly and their covers cannot be washed, which is often done today.
And, given that every night we perspire between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat, it is clear that after five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, the sellers give a tip: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of the cleaning and washing of the cover carefully, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although mattress covers with zipper closure are currently manufactured around their perimeter, so when they are opened they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), Their handling in larger models size (and by one person) when lifting the mattress it can seem like a fight between a flyweight and a heavyweight.
In bed, instead of a box spring, do you have a firm board?
Never!
At most for the beds designed for visitors to spend one night.
However, it should make (if you don&#39;t already have them) ventilation holes in the board and it should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (like the German Taschenfederkern) and a layer soft.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
Latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut fiber) can be used for non-articulating slatted beds containing between 14 and 18 slats, although a bed base with a greater number of mattresses is always better. laminae, 28 or more, in which the laminae of the lumbar area are reinforced and their stiffness can be regulated.
Articulating slatted bases should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to recline.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the slats, you can also use shoulder protection.
It is a special fixation of the slats that allows the slats to be pressed or even tilted in such a way that they perfectly &quot;surround&quot; the shoulders during sleep.
For men with very broad shoulders, this is very important.
Even mattress manufacturers remember them, who, in the &quot;male&quot; ones, began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding clients, there are slatted or cross-structure bed bases with so-called multi-torsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that even if you use the right mattress and box spring, if you use a bad pillow (large and &quot;fluffy&quot;), most of the benefits will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the corners can only reach up to the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can relax.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, which is normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on your side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the box spring with shoulder bolster or the softest area of the mattress) as shoulder height.
Modern mattresses seem to have something to do with original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are in fashion.
The petroleum-based raw materials, from which the polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soy.
In fact, practically all known manufacturers use soybeans.
&quot;Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin&quot;, explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Likewise, natural substances are used during the manufacture of mattress covers, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are &quot;cooled&quot; with breeze plant extracts, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to &quot;heat&quot; the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel more warm.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and memory foam rigidities allows for the manufacture of multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, shoulders and heels are going.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns and up.
Those that perform a therapeutic function tend to have a lower VAT, since they are considered as health means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and box springs.
Sometimes you can approve offers from manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a memory foam attached to the cover for 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and high density began with the &quot;cosmic&quot; material from Tempur.
Initially it emerged as material for NASA, because during takeoffs the astronauts were subjected to an enormous overload.
Tempur softens in heat and hardens in cold.
Consequently, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Memory foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents are using people tracking devices to monitor their children
Fear for children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in the case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device is about the size of a matchbox, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were afraid of the case of the missing Anička and began to inform themselves about the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
&quot;We are all trying to tell ourselves that it is not about spying, but about another means to reduce the chances of a tragedy,&quot; says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
&quot;I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are put in someone&#39;s bag without their knowledge, but we have not come across such cases yet.&quot;
&quot;Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,&quot; adds Pilin.
In his opinion, children should always know what the &quot;box&quot; is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková warns about the fact that if the child does not want to carry it, he will simply throw it away.
&quot;Even the youngest children show great creativity in intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled.&quot;
&quot;Before, parents relied heavily on mobiles, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,&quot; says Bočková.
In his opinion, it is debatable whether such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
&quot;If it is a prepared kidnapping, the perpetrator will practically always check if the child is carrying some type of electronic device that can reveal his location.&quot;
&quot;Now it&#39;s the phone.&quot;
&quot;As the use of tracking devices becomes more widespread, it will also look for them, since their sale will undoubtedly be done with a lot of publicity.&quot;
&quot;In such cases, criminals are always one step ahead of the police,&quot; says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the event of an impromptu pedophile attack.
According to Robert Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if the tracking device is immediately destroyed after an attack, their presence can help.
&quot;You can configure the device to send the position regularly after a certain period.&quot;
&quot;If it suffers damage, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question.&quot;
&quot;The more expensive devices have a built-in tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and becomes immobile, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,&quot; says Čech.
In his opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smart mobile phones with navigation, in which only special software has to be installed.
The problem with current monitoring units is that at the moment they are devices with a size similar to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, for that reason, tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital watch.
&quot;In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device.&quot;
&quot;Or to identify him after a certain time, which can save the police time,&quot; he adds.
Whether the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will still use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
It involves checking the position with a GPS system (used in normal car navigation) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough fuses to encircle the whole of the Czech Republic. But they only last two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of fuse to ignite explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of fuse to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the wick is two years, four at the most.
The army bought the explosives fuse from the STV Group for 40 million kronor.
The General&#39;s staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such an enormous quantity of match saying that soldiers need 60 kilometers of match per year for training maneuvers.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnicians, with whom MF DNES contacted, however, it is decided that, in such a case, all generals, high command officers, should carry out such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year. and even secretaries and cleaners.
Neither Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr nor Army Captain Vlastimil Picek wanted to be exempted.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army wasting sixty kilometers of fuse.
Such a length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if that were the case, the army would have enough supplies to last more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of fuse, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the engineering or special units) sufficient stocks for the 225 listed above.
Soldiers from the rapid intervention brigade recently complained personally to Minister Vondra because they say they have little ammunition for various weapons, so even target practice is limited for money.
And let&#39;s not talk about the lack of underwear.
&quot;I also cannot understand why they repeatedly buy such quantities of wick from us.&quot;
&quot;But it is their decision and they will undoubtedly know why they act this way.&quot;
&quot;For us, the army is a good customer that, as a company, we try to satisfy,&quot; admits STV Group commercial director Jan Děcký.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometers of match, also saying that he will have a stock of this &quot;ammunition&quot; for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from the STV Group indicates that the fuse only has a useful life of four years and, in the case of fireworks for the army or the police, two years.
&quot;If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four,&quot; says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require an additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometers of wick, it obtained a discount.
&quot;They cost us 60% less than last year&#39;s order for 244 kilometers,&quot; says spokesman Pejšek from the Defense Ministry&#39;s purchasing center.
Just to compare: the annual fuse consumption of the police pyrotechnics, who dispose of the ammunition of the Second World War or that left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask for only the right amount to use up the ammunition before its useful life runs out.
They decided it for safety reasons for the pyrotechnicians and, in addition, in the meantime more modern and reliable types of fuse are available.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the 200,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: hundreds of kilometers of old wick will have to be eliminated, which is now being bought &quot;cheaply&quot;.
Until now I continue to live on the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the &quot;Entrepreneur of the Year&quot; contest helped Lukáš Pytloun sell his hotel franchises.
In the last edition, the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec won the &quot;Entrepreneur of the Year&quot; contest.
His success story looks like something out of a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad, he realized that Liberec needed quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he made from seasonal jobs abroad and a loan from the bank, he bought a half-dilapidated five-story house.
Considering that he was still in his third year at university, he was really brave.
&quot;Today, the value for money of accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it,&quot; says Lukáš Pytloun.
He began renting the rebuilt first floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned was invested back in the building, which he gradually converted into a 54-room boarding house.
Since then, in seven years in business, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels in Liberec with a total capacity of around 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year he opened another of the same quality.
&quot;We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,&quot; said last year&#39;s number one businessman.
&quot;Winning the &#39;Entrepreneur of the Year&#39; contest was a great help to this sale of hotel licenses,&quot; adds Pytloun gratefully.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding areas.
&quot;People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,&quot; he recalls.
Without a doubt, he recommends everyone who wants to try a company that participates in the contest.
But consider that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He affirms that, so far, he continues to live off the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
&quot;With some people that I met thanks to the contest I have started to collaborate regularly.&quot;
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
in total about seventy.
&quot;I&#39;ve seen them show increased loyalty and are proud to be involved in something that garnered widespread recognition.&quot;
&quot;It is by no means my own personal success, but rather the result of the hard work of the entire team.&quot;
&quot;Only it is my name that appears on the front page,&quot; Lukáš Pytloun says modestly today.
I wish my successor a more peaceful year than we have had at Farmet
The euphoria over the victory was soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the victor&#39;s hard work, Farmet may already be past the worst.
The owner of the Farmet company, Karel Žďárský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone competition &quot;Company of the year&quot;, last year at the &quot;Slavic House&quot; in Prague.
The jury appreciated his efforts, with which he succeeded in turning a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
&quot;I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition,&quot; says last year&#39;s winner.
The history of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
For this reason, when the state proposed to Karel Žďárský&#39;s father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the seizure of properties during communism, he did not hesitate much; He resigned his position at the company where he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, they founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They obtained a greater presence also among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the media contest.
&quot;Not only our customers began to view the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to value collaboration with a company that was more successful in their country,&quot; says Karel Žďárský.
Last year was perhaps not just a display of the euphoria of victory at Farmet.
It also obtained recognition for the commercial results until 2008 and, partially, 2009.
And precisely the year 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
&quot;We, obviously, weren&#39;t free from such a situation either.&quot;
&quot;Revenues were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs,&quot; explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable business must sometimes even adopt unpopular measures.
Nevertheless, they controlled the situation and kept the company&#39;s profits, even if it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
Regardless, where Farmet didn&#39;t cut spending was on research and development.
&quot;With the grants, we have built a research and training center, strengthened our presence in the international market and obtained excellent reviews at national fairs,&quot; says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are on the rise again and, with them, the number of new employees.
&quot;The new achievement they hope will bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,&quot; notes Karel Žďárský.
A poll that reveals the ridiculous rules
The Absurdez of the Year survey is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already managed to remove some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was made by more than a third of nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the social security administration asked for an extract from the commercial register, although its officials can obtain it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
&quot;The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial register when carrying out a check on the insured&#39;s tax,&quot; said ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová.
The objective of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations that businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year it is for the fourth time part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and is also beginning to create fans among the general public.
While last year&#39;s edition had the participation of three thousand voters, this year it practically reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations to spare that must be respected simply to trade.
&quot;Perhaps we are in first place in the number of tax returns in the world,&quot; says Karel Havlíček from the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplifying business rules has been a declared goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation improves especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions to have a company, the Czech Republic is ranked 74th, that is, eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. The contest organizer then chooses seven candidates for the &quot;anti-prize&quot; and, during October, allows the public to vote online through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that receives the most votes wins.
For this year&#39;s survey, more than 100 were submitted, in particular 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples were sent by both businessmen, professional associations and journalists.
Among the &quot;finalists&quot; of the contest was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of the seventy proposals for this year is published on the pages of the contest.
The announcement of the contest, which always takes place at the beginning of November in Prague&#39;s Wenceslas Square, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, this competition event was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
&quot;Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continually hinders businessmen, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade&quot;, announced the Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek .
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations do not end in borage.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the employer&#39;s obligation to notify the business office of the permanent operating area three days in advance of his intention to attend a fair or exhibition with a booth.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that finished second in number of votes in 2007, that is, the communication to the labor office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the so-called green card law. .
And the third time is the charm.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales in their practice.
For this reason, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
New in this fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny competition is the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The purpose of this contest is to support responsible and fair companies.
&quot;In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities&quot;, says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
Companies for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal were submitted for this new special sub-category of this year&#39;s edition of the 2010 Vodafone Company Main Contest.
The history of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely from one to another, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it concerns, for example, disabled people, in others, personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from across the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in various sports tournaments.
Another example of a responsible company in the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main donor of funds to sponsor disabled children for seven years now.
In Poděbrad, there is a stationery that cares especially about the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the workforce; This is why it received the title of Company Responsible for the Central Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition it finished third in the region.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
&quot;We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities have the least possible impact on the environment,&quot; explains businesswoman Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit of the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; In addition, it supports working from home and uses the catering services of a local protected company at its business events.
&quot;In addition, we support the Person in Distress scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community,&quot; says company representative Ondřej Suchý.
The laundry company Praní a čištění in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive special bonuses that have an impact on their pension funds, also rank well with a mention.
&quot;We provide benefits in food, transport, skill upgrading and leisure,&quot; says Josef Strapáč from the Bruntál Czasch construction company, winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category of Responsible Company of the Year, all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically nominated, who answered the questions on the entry form and sent it to the organizers before August 15th.
The organizers eliminated from the evaluation the forms that were not complete or erroneous.
&quot;If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the contest for Responsible Company of the Year, but they are not disqualified from the&quot; main &quot;Vodafone Company of the Year contest.&quot;
&quot;Individual applications for this contest are not allowed, as it is a sub-category of the main contest for Company of the Year,&quot; explains Karel Goldman of the Bison &amp; Rose consultancy.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police made several arrests at the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media businessman and real estate businessman Luboš G.
Apparently, the latter attempted to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land would be received by a specific interested party.
He had to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns for it.
&quot;At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender,&quot; Pilsen Attorney General Antonie Zelená told Právo, adding that at the moment she cannot disclose more details about ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On the way in which he was able to influence the public auction, given the little official information, one can only speculate.
The Lubomíra Agricultural Fund spokesperson Černá responded to Právo&#39;s questions saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at the Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
&quot;This is a client, not one of our workers,&quot; he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called &quot;Call for the presentation of proposals for transfer of land in accordance with the law on land&quot; and is carried out when several interested parties appear in relation to the offered land.
&quot;These people, during the summons, offer a higher value than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced.&quot;
&quot;Based on the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and, later, the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the highest offer,&quot; explained the Fund&#39;s spokeswoman.
Luboš G. had information on who was going to present to the call and, given that he is also an interested person because he acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to those interested in the land that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain why, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was charged with dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund planned land for the construction of public infrastructures, in particular at the site where a large road to the Borská pole industrial zone should be built.
Later, he exchanged them in a very beneficial way with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay additional expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
As a result, families will have to withdraw from their wallets, from January, several hundred crowns a month more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas by around 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 kronor more per year than now.
However, the main electricity providers reduced prices, due to increasing support for energy production from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics.
However, gas becomes moderately expensive, especially at a time when heating is used more and, therefore, consumption is higher.
In this case, they should also have a couple hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive across the country, the price change for central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 more crowns per month for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns a year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rent for infrastructure.
If the rent remains the same, Prague residents will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest in the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
They can significantly increase rental prices for 450,000 rented flats in Prague, where regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, will increase the rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take to court those who disagree with the new rent.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of around 300,000 flats, could rise as much as 10% next year.
Young Czechs get drunk on Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer in mode, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
Those are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continually to get over a hangover are no longer an exception.
This stems from the experience of physicians who come across such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
&quot;Drinking beer or wine is no longer in fashion, because they take a long time to get drunk.&quot;
&quot;Now the trend is strong alcoholic beverages,&quot; Luděk Pelikán, head of pediatrics at Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia, tells Právo.
&quot;When they manage to get their father a bottle from the cupboard, it may be whiskey, but usually it&#39;s Fernet and vodka.&quot;
&quot;Vodka has the advantage that it is lightened with juice and that it doesn&#39;t smell as much,&quot; he explains.
It is also confirmed by the spokeswoman for Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
&quot;Usually this is Fernet or rum.&quot;
&quot;Those are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren.&quot;
&quot;In some cases, they use brandy that they took at home,&quot; adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, thirteen and fourteen-year-old drinkers are the ones who usually appear in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where she has been working since this year, she worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances brought young people from nearby areas.
&quot;A girl had to enter maybe four times.&quot;
&quot;It began when she was twelve years old, when they brought her with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy,&quot; says the department doctor about this case.
&quot;He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party.&quot;
&quot;The interesting thing is that her mother was not surprised that her daughter disappeared 48 hours,&quot; the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance towards drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, one cannot properly speak of dependency.
&quot;An alcoholic is understood as a person who has been chronically dependent on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children.&quot;
&quot;In those who repeatedly drink alcohol, it is rather due to a systematically unsuccessful social or family environment,&quot; explains Chief Pelikán.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová, this year at the Motol pediatric clinic forty drunk children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, the statistics only show those who come with a serious poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the mobile medical examination, go home with their parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children simply meet after school and drink brandy, for Pelikán there are three seasonal ups and downs that should be mentioned: Halloween, New Year&#39;s Eve and the end of the school year.
&quot;In such circumstances, they drink because of poor grades or, on the contrary, they celebrate the beginning of the holidays.&quot;
&quot;On Halloween, I have seen up to seven drunk children in admissions at the same time,&quot; adds Pelikán.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
The morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided with the injection of a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that the body lacks.
&quot;They wear it much better, because after a hectic night, they get up well and it doesn&#39;t hurt at all.&quot;
&quot;They are only confused about where they are,&quot; says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose their good humor at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization in a room for critically ill patients cost up to ten thousand crowns.
&quot;I have often used cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a youth job for you to earn enough to pay for that night &quot;adds Pelikán.
Health insurance, in his opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually reimburses people for the costs of treatment, does not do so for children who drink.
Two L-159 planes are in the hands of others for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Defense Ministry replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa aircraft - EADS is located.
It is the first time that such a device has been in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad for practice or demonstration flights.
It is the two-seater version L-159T1, which up to now was used by the Czech army and which was still in a state of flight.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seater L-159.
These are still kept at Aer Vodochody and the intermediary for the sale, the Omnipol company, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peješk from the defense press department indicates that it is not yet known when the planes will be physically removed from Vodochody.
&quot;The single-seater L-159 planes, on the other hand, were separated from the planes repaired long ago, without investments or additional contributions from the Ministry.&quot;
&quot;The two-seater L-159T1s were exchanged in their current state,&quot; he told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army does not run out of two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for an amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new aircraft was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS promised that the aircraft would be added to the equipment of some allied countries.
&quot;The contract clearly indicates that the EADS company is the one that retires the L-159 aircraft and that they will be used for the training of pilots from NATO countries.&quot;
&quot;So it is up to the buyer to decide how they are going to use them in this framework,&quot; says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published ahead of time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the Mirek Topolánek government.
The Defense Ministry did not launch a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense directorate claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Defense Ministry before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by conducting a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one is due to arrive at Prague&#39;s Kbely airport in fourteen days.
An index finger longer than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a longer index than the ring finger are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British cancer magazine.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
&quot;Our results indicate that relative finger length may be a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men up to the age of 60,&quot; said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Research. on cancer at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly if this characteristic is associated with genetic risk or other detrimental factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the indica finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They were as likely to have prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of men with an index longer than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men aged less than 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he is aware of the study, but does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be &quot;fully demonstrated&quot;.
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, woke up covered in snow on Thursday.
Roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by packed snow and snow throwers circulated throughout the night in many areas.
In the morning, the D5 road between kilometers 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov was closed due to several accidents involving commercial vehicles and passenger cars, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Ústředního automotoklubu (ÚAMK).
At kilometer 91 a truck broke down, at kilometer 93 two industrial vehicles collided, causing injuries.
Also several cars ended up in the gutter.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 in the direction of Prague.
There two trucks collided.
Drivers should drive slowly behind Brno at kilometer 190 or through Brno and merge at kilometer 182 at Kývalce.
There, traffic jams of several kilometers have formed.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 ºC.
Traffic jams are forming for example in Prosek, although Štěrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight in the morning, there will be another state of crisis in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check what the current situation is.
The Ruzyně airport was closed from eleven o&#39;clock on Wednesday night until five o&#39;clock in the morning.
Nowadays, most of the roads in southern Moravia can already be circulated, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska, three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brněnska tongues of snow are forming and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
To clear them, milling machines will be required.
At the moment it cannot be said when they will open to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians) area.
Roads in the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, simply have to be left inert, accumulate up to two inches of snow, according to ČTK.
In the Czech Republic between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall gradually subsides in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new &quot;smart weapon&quot;
The US military is using a new &quot;smart&quot; weapon in Afghanistan, known at the moment only by the code name XM-25.
The generals hope the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and &quot;change the progress of the game&quot; towards their victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol and with extremely precise aim.
Its bullets are fired with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive charge it contains causes it to actually function like a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point along their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Certainly no normal protection can be used, and when it casts its murderous rain of metal splinters, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use &quot;smart&quot; technology.
&quot;The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, aim their laser beam at it, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise crosshair and, based on it, corrects the projection line and pulls the trigger.&quot;
&quot;Let&#39;s say 543 meters have been measured.&quot;
&quot;When the trigger is pressed, the weapon loads and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus minus one, two or three meters,&quot; says Audette.
400 jobs transferred
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant of the sector specializing in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on the street. Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term another 100 more employees of the consortium, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, in addition the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way of working of the employees.
Furthermore, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner stated, &quot;In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.&quot;
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday caused joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
The head of the Frankfurt economics section, Markus Frank (CDU) affirmed that this has earned him a &quot;Global Player&quot;.
This is a &quot;great recognition of the location.&quot;
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu&#39;s decision.
Management previously informed the city of their intention.
&quot;We have naturally offered the company our help,&quot; Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons brought about the crash.
In such a way, now there is a large empty place to fill in the famous post.
&quot;I hope the owner and landlord of the building are cooperative.&quot;
The building previously used by Fujitsu on the Rathausplatz and the neighboring &quot;Kleine Vertikale&quot; were part with the leftover buildings of Marienbader Platz from ten years ago of a controversial construction project of the spa town.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the town hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for criticism regarding the massive building that previously used the holes as parking spaces and as for the level of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and appraisal companies, the software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, have been installed, as well as then Siemens joined the company manufacturer of computers Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, originally from Tokyo, is recognized as the world&#39;s third largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the necessary services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more businesses in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the next subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company under the name TDS.
That&#39;s why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex from the 1920s, its name refers to its star-shaped plan, houses, among others, the central electrotechnical association and the electronics industry.
Amazon Cancels Server - Threats Against Assange
Anguish is taking hold more and more of Wikileaks.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Possibly behind it is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is reportedly in custody in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, always louder in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are currently looking for an internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol&#39;s wanted list, must remain in detention in Britain, according to an article.
&quot;Wikileaks kicked out of Amazon&#39;s server.&quot;
&quot;To speak freely in the land of freedom,&quot; the activists of the revelations communicated through the messaging service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed the Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to publishing secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon services website in order to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: &quot;Perfect, we will use our dollars to hire people in Europe.&quot;
If Amazon has a problem with free speech, &quot;they should stop selling books.&quot;
Amazon halted use of its server through Wikileaks after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported according to a call to Lieberman&#39;s office.
The presidency of the Senate Council for the country&#39;s security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British &quot;Guardian&quot; reported.
&quot;I had wanted Amazon to take these steps before, before previous releases of classified information through WikiLeaks,&quot; the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
&quot;The illegal, monstrous and inconsiderate process of Wikileaks puts our national security at risk and threatens life in the world,&quot; the independent senator said in a statement.
&quot;No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to spread stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol&#39;s wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot;, the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The internet activist has consistently called the investigation in Sweden a plot by his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there have been threats.
&quot;There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange.&quot;
That is why there are fears for Assange&#39;s safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to the American statements.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, said that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations must be tried for treason and must be executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should &quot;be assassinated&quot; and Obama could &quot;use a drone.&quot;
A great dispute grows between the White House and Assange.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it &quot;ridiculous and absurd&quot; that Assange has called for the resignation of the secretary of state, should she be responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage.
&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,&quot; said Gibbs.
&quot;Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than your website.&quot;
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in a general way.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution for the National Counter-Terrorism Center, has been named exceptional manager, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing &quot;the important structural reforms&quot;, which are necessary in light of the Wikileaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists, they must endanger the publication of Wikileaks.
&quot;We have done everything possible to contact them,&quot; said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
&quot;We are prepared to help protect them if necessary.&quot;
Ice cream university
At the &quot;Gelato University&quot; in Bologna ice cream parlors are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day Basic Course for Future Ice Cream Makers has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
Of gelatiere and gelataio.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The gelataio removes the cream from the ice cream from the counter with a spatula, spreads it on the wafer and sells it.
To know this, you don&#39;t have to go to Anzola dell&#39;Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice creams, should not visit the &quot;Gelato University&quot; of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the university of ice cream with the freezer in 2003, so that the cream of the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day Basic Course for Future Ice Cream Makers has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlor.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of this art from California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years in an unnerving job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master ice cream maker Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants afterwards the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste is decisive, but also its silky smoothness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training or the cream covering of the national superior house and mainly of the south of the country: &quot;Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why each scoop has something romantic.&quot;
The first step to the elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and instantly cools it down to four degrees.
Then he opens the tap of the machine and a basic pasteurized white cream comes out, the base for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream cream be made only with natural elements or without stabilizer?
How can you unleash some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that they lose track of the trends of the time.
The one who talks about ice cream &quot;not only natural ingredients&quot;, maybe he has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, from guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, place it in a bag and the customer will bite into a sonorous granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
Regarding the taste of ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients those that are bought in the fruit or sweets section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
&quot;All vendors will try to sneak flavored ingredients into their merchandise.&quot;
&quot;However they must experiment sometime.&quot;
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the white basic mass, which with eggs will turn into a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the base for all the possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now course participants can use the ice cream makers.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream each time, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They also carry out the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
That it tastes better does not necessarily depend on it having more toffee aroma or more fruit puree.
Hazelnut ice cream does not need to taste like nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The task force makes the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water, and slightly less stabilizer.
A balanced mix first brings out the flavor of the ice cream, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is an artimetic problem: the peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, it is necessary to reduce the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a utensil with which he sets the amount of sugar in the types of fruit (the winemaker&#39;s measurement for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make it easy to count.
Making ice cream requires no more than physical application, as before.
Not only does the utensil help for the automatic preparation of the basic dough.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to sub-zero temperature.
In spite of everything, all the automation is left out when it comes to the small dough.
Brazilian Gustavo smears himself and his teammates from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if he were an uncontrolled giant mini-first.
&quot;In all the courses&quot;, affirms the teacher Luciano, &quot;it is only a question of time that something like this happens.&quot;
Inspectors in a difficult situation
The European food safety authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
Currently this matter is formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for the independent evaluation of the impact of biotechnology.
&quot;It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven&#39;t documented it well,&quot; said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
Harry Kuiper, the head of Efsa&#39;s expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been employed for years by the Ilsi association.
Consortia like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer pay for it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to Efsa&#39;s testing standards for genetically modified plants, which puts it in a clear conflict of interest, criticized Then.
Efsa&#39;s provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and mimic the writing of the company, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a senior manager from Efsa went without the support or the transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed her side with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were made by the General Environment Office as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Efsa cannot acknowledge any conflict of interest.
All the formal data is used, also some of the industry, as long as they are of a high and technical quality, they are arranged in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others, for risk assessment for biotechnology without being commissioned by Lobby.
On this subject, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that currently transgenic plants are allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not proven.
&quot;We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in agriculture,&quot; Then says.
Current practice consists in verifying only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
&quot;If risks are not sought, how are they to be found?&quot; Asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, the industry increasingly tries, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a rule.
&quot;Industry controls security research,&quot; Hilbeck maintains.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has gotten some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba on his back.
There were demonstrations
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September the bulldozers arrived and began to tear down a large chunk of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Thousands and thousands demonstrated against the 21st, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing became debris.
Broken into 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
A couple of chunks have been secured.
&quot;These stones are relics.&quot;
&quot;They must not disappear.&quot;
He gets excited: &quot;A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural.&quot;
As you said once, you have smelled cigarette smoke.
He still doesn&#39;t know what to do with the chunks.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The Stuttgart Stones trail leads to a forest in Tubingen at a former French Navy ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich Stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He has bought everything from the demolition in Stuttgart.
&quot;There would be disgrace, they would grind the gravel or send it to the dump,&quot; he says in his office, a little wooden house that was once a guardhouse.
They insulted and threatened him, he explains, when, in September, it appeared in the newspapers that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
He spoke with the enemies of 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that there was absolutely nothing he could do about the takedown.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80 kilos corn cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also with the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the woods, the rest have long been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could take in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of momentum has long become &quot;the wall&quot; or the boundary of Kräuterbeeten.
&quot;This stone is actually nothing special,&quot; says Rongen.
&quot;If it weren&#39;t for the political component.&quot;
Climb his SUV, take a tour of his vast 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he is interested in computers and finally works with stones.
And he is a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
Transport your treasures throughout Germany.
He claims to be the largest ancient stone dealer in the country.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic crushed sandstone stones.
&quot;They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge,&quot; he explains.
Limestone alba, yellow, warm, gets excited.
&quot;My dear stone.&quot;
The path crosses the forest.
Point out a lot: Red sandstone, a previous chunk of Karlsruhe station.
And it goes on.
&quot;Nice travertine.&quot;
Formerly the mazizos belonged to the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, tuff from Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones earlier and moved them with a simple rig and a cart, he feels very devoted.
&quot;It would be a scandal if something were destroyed.&quot;
He has not gotten rich, not at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave the stone dealer something to do, plus stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glazier and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
&quot;We work hard, but it&#39;s satisfying,&quot; says the man who takes care of the remains.
He has to go to Cologne shortly.
There are also stones to salvage there.
Talent struggle around great potentials
There is an active influx at the buffet.
16 students crowd around muffins, tomato soup, and candy.
The Braunschweig University of Technology and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with the VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
In rivalry and in the same way, many companies, like VW, meet in a hand-to-hand fight around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: To hire the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the job market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications about their students&#39; abilities, an attempt is made to spot and capture exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins over talent.
A lady from the personnel department hands out pens, gummies and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the excited young talents the internship programs and student jobs and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is leading the project with VW.
He sees advantages for both parties: &quot;Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience.&quot;
&quot;In turn, VW can get to know the students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers.&quot;
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so directly desired.
&quot;The main point previously was in the technical projects,&quot; says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large pool of applicants.
If not, they have to advertise and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students of engineering disciplines are in an excellent bargaining position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacant engineering positions in October.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this engineering void will grow even larger.
At the auditing and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of the talent hunt.
It organizes expensive recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern gymkhana, in which participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the US next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the start.
Only the crème de la crème of many participants goes to the US.
Universities are increasingly striving to pick and polish high potential universities, according to Dykta.
&quot;With the race we want to stand out from the crowd.&quot;
&quot;The simple journey alone fell short of us.&quot;
For the Dykta scout, the notes pay off.
&quot;Until today we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants.&quot;
&quot;Some are nearing their end, and they want to apply to work with us,&quot; he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also on the hunt, above all, small and medium-sized companies, classic with their job fairs.
&quot;We try to get students at the trade fairs.&quot;
&quot;Something about Intersolar,&quot; says Sitha Stübe, chief of staff for solar technology maker Solarworld.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
Currently 35 vacancies appear on the company&#39;s website.
&quot;It is being very difficult to fill the vacant positions.&quot;
&quot;It costs a lot of time and money,&quot; he says.
A shorter way is the contact with the professors of the university.
Solarworld collaborates with several colleges, for example the University of Freiberg.
&quot;The professors advise that you can do an internship with us or do your thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, level hierarchy and comfortable communication.
&quot;A large consortium cannot normally offer it,&quot; says Stübe, the Personnel Officer.
When looking for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The deciding factors are flexible working hours, childcare, or good promotion possibilities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld is ranked 55 among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute produces an annual list of the best German job providers.
For what he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the job and with the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the personnel manager, also expects extra points in her ranking for her job applicants.
&quot;I think the applicant is especially looking at the external classifications of a potential employer,&quot; he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies wanting a long-term strategy to earn a good name as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
&quot;The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves,&quot; he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called Internal Employer Branding, also promoting corporate identity within the staff itself.
&quot;Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.&quot;
When you treat people well and identify you with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer from friends and acquaintances.
&quot;It&#39;s like a gang game,&quot; says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
No new oil drilling has appeared in recent years from the coast of the US state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico.
The government of Washington issued a forceful ban and with it annulled its previous plans in an unappealable way.
Also off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains closed for the moment.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What prompted this strict ban, which will be in effect for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil rig in April.
Before the disaster that killed eleven workers and caused the greatest environmental catastrophe in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and the industry.
The supporters thus wanted to lessen the US&#39;s dependence on new supplies of oil from abroad.
Until today it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable oil spill in the gulf.
At the center of criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of lawsuits.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, different petroleum consortiums submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by employing tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently the responsible supervisory authority, which after being accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, is being fundamentally reformed.
Obama announces in parallel that lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
&quot;The government&#39;s plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries,&quot; says the result of the current survey conducted by the advisory firm BDO - ahead of Wednesday&#39;s extraction ban.
American Energey Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: &quot;Nobody knows what exactly changes with regulation.&quot;
Investments in new extraction projects continue for the time being, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water in the rivers is brown oil, it smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of oil spilled have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live off theft, corruption and the illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine with it.
&quot;Do not get tired,&quot; the environmental activist reassures journalists: &quot;Today enough oil will pass before your eyes.&quot;
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in chest-deep water with the glitter of lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene looks almost pretty.
It is not seen that brown oil stains are floating on the surface.
Before, I used to catch shrimp by handfuls here, explains Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty river.
Meanwhile, the flowing waters are totally dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland from a broken pipeline.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach the waters full of fish: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most plagued regions in the world.
On the way along the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat&#39;s engine removes a brown broth, who dips his hand into the water, will draw some full of oil.
Mangrove tree roots rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating palms that collide and dangle their palms.
Flocks of birds are searched in vain, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier outside is silenced, a kind of ghostly calm of a former paradise smelling of a gas station expands within it.
&quot;What is happening here is an ecological struggle,&quot; says Celestine Akpobari sullenly. &quot;We live in constant danger to health.&quot;
The war comparison proceeds.
The area of the settlement of the Ogoni has been a fought battlefield for years: The first European explorers broke in more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed The Shell consortium had to place its first factory here in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for the oil employees.
Even today the return of companies to Ogoniland is prohibited: While daily pumping more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters, steel platforms jutted out like bizarre water sculptures: &quot;Christmas trees&quot; they called affectionately to the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most have total corrosion.
Every moment a head fails, Akpobari believes, then a constant stream of oil gushes into the water.
According to expert assessments, more than two billion liters have been dumped in 50 years in the delta ecosystem: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the breakdown of the ship &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; 21 years ago in the Alaskan Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the long-lasting environmental region will deal with it.
While the Shell consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting headers and leaky pipes as the main culprits.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low standards of safety, normally in the world the conventional ones, the scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only the rates of defects of the pipes are &quot;about a multiple greater than elsewhere&quot;.
In a place that seems forgotten from afar, a workshop full of oil appears under the free sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered in oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the perforations, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire blazes: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated on the fire for more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, the gasoline enters the container through the pipes, later the oil pipe leaks and finally diesel comes out.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-liter barrels of diesel daily: &quot;It brings us 34,000 naira&quot;, about $ 22.
Delta dwellers take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in Black Africa.
Nigeria only has a single refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euro-cent per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: Thus they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from &quot;those in the bunkers&quot;, who rigged the network of pipelines that crosses Ogonilandia: According to experts, at this rate at least 16 million liters of oil are lost per day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a negligible part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, which also include politicians and high-ranking military officials, keep the best part in cisterns and sell it cheaply on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is due to population management or the lax way of production as purely academic.
&quot;If the oil companies did not behave like invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries.&quot;
While the conditions of the Ogoni are destroyed above all by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: &quot;Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as Chinese.&quot;
Michael gets nervous.
&quot;It&#39;s about time you disappeared,&quot; says the muscular Ölmann.
&quot;The soldiers can come at any minute.&quot;
If the army special unit catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten them with arrest, but with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to profit from raw materials.
&quot;This damned invention has completely shattered our country,&quot; says Akpobari.
Investigators Spot Dangerous Factory Defects in A380 Engines
Apparently the A380 has a big safety problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a hard landing, the investigators found a possible factory defect, which can lead to &quot;catastrophic engine failure.&quot;
Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers on the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were much luckier than you can imagine: Australian aviation safety authorities perceived a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s through their investigations, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a sleeve connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report released Thursday.
This could have caused &quot;catastrophic engine failure&quot;.
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal measures against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in federal court in Sydney that allowed for further legal action against the company.
Qantas director Alan Joyce stated that his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the brand of the engine they have lost parts and their wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian investigators announced that they will conduct further safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, a spokesman for ATSB.
The security issue has become significant enough to inform everyone affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet grounded for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily grounded.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a precaution.
This double-decked aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A nationwide snowfall causes traffic chaos
Germany totally white: From one day to the next it has snowed in almost the entire country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter Freezes Germany: Freezing temperatures were reached throughout most of the country overnight on Thursday, causing traffic chaos in many places.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a 6-inch thick layer of snow.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the snow plows are in continuous operation, plowing new snow again and again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects spring tides with the water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic Sea coast Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the meteorological service Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow there and cold and strong winds are responsible for swirling it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there overnight.
Also in Saxony Anhalt the police authorities reported major disturbances in the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
Snowfall in Thuringia affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major upheavals are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the rails or shattered catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service treated the 165 passengers on the train with woolen blankets, food and drink.
Snowy winds sweep the streets.
At the largest German airport, snowy winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokeswoman there are already 40 canceled flights.
The snowplows are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 tent beds prepared for them.
On many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a rail crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg due to snowy streets: Here too a truck was hit at a railroad crossing because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver lost his life.
In the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after overturning her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will get softer and more powdery and will therefore swirl in gentle gusts.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly still be very cold, in some places down to negative 15 degrees.
Deusche Bank seeks a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutschen Bank recently spruced up its headquarters: The twin towers in Frankfurt&#39;s banking district were modernized; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to cash in on the costs of the renovation, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the &quot;Financial Times Deutschland&quot; claims based on a spokesperson.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the planned sale.
&quot;We always check if it is convenient to own the properties or sell them and then rent them again,&quot; he said.
This is why Germany&#39;s largest credit institution relinquishes its company headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for € 272 million from a house fund investor and then made the necessary arrangements.
The energy reforms reached figures of approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would cost the bank a lot of money.
Experts in this field estimate the value of the newspaper towers renamed &quot;Greentowers&quot; at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are being sold to a bank fund or to an independent investor has not currently been disclosed, the spokesperson said.
Thousands of people mourning the deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who were declared dead after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures are still precarious at the scene of the disaster.
Almost two weeks ago an intense explosion took place at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced at the scene of the misfortune, but did not discover any signs of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue team was able to go down for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts concluded that there was no chance that the miners had survived.
No bodies have been recovered to date.
Currently, family and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed in the blazing sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand&#39;s South Island.
They are silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the miners&#39; helmets, lamps and names.
There were also photographs and personal items, underneath clothing and surfboards.
The flags flew at half mast in front of the country&#39;s government buildings.
New Zealand waited for the miners to return to the surface &quot;from the depths of the earth,&quot; John Key, the New Zealand Prime Minister, told the commemorative participants.
&quot;But they never came home.&quot;
You can&#39;t assume your son&#39;s death until you&#39;ve seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative ceremony.
In the first explosion on November 19, British and South African miners were also buried.
Salvage workers began by extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand&#39;s south island.
As soon as the explosive gases have been removed, the scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, Gary Knowles, the police superior, told reporters.
To hell, warrior!
Does gore fit into art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the frontiers of the genre with his battle epic &quot;Walhalla Rising.&quot;
What audience will Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when filming &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot;?
An imprisoned one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and slays his enemies with almost superhuman fights, sounds ideal for young viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and ripping his enemies guts out of their bodies alive when he&#39;s in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as he is actually called, says almost no words during the entire film and the other characters are carried away by at most one or two sentences or a couple of painful mortal screams.
Otherwise they shut up and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes of Scotland, which the backstage offers to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown-up filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a movie has multiple target groups it is a shame that they cannot be ruled out.
Director Winding Refn regards his savages and the &quot;Pusher&quot; drug dealer hairstyle trilogy as something of a Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his plays open to all audiences with a little more humor in it. mainstream or somewhat less art house brutality.
A brain mass and guttering guts can&#39;t deter most art film fans.
Most action fans are bored to death if Unojo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and is stuck for an eternity in the calm and fog before his team reaches America. and shut up there again.
It is a pity that &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot; has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, there is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into a film.
And so there is no escape for viewers.
Refn takes just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy trance soundtrack make a lump in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, that from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a little blond young man, who supports Unojo faithfully, retains something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, at any moment becomes a warrior out of hell to enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents doom, but maybe only for those who are lost anyway.
&quot;Walhalla Rising&quot; is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to be angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious earth movements
The nuclear energy organization IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
At around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
His name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with North Korea&#39;s help in the cube, hidden in a valley that comes out of the river.
According to information from the US international intelligence service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, a common reactor was designed under the name of the vicinity of el-Kibar, very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which they are built nuclear weapons.
On the other hand, the technique hardly serves any other purpose than for those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the components of the reactor were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or from inside.
The reactor was only up and running, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is scarcely better known than it was then, the enigmas grew larger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently disclosed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was absolutely certain that the Syrians had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but saw little indication that in the country had &quot;a nuclear weapons program.&quot;
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about a &quot;supposed reactor&quot;, although they consider the CIA presentation &quot;plausible&quot;.
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of you, a top UN diplomat responded lapidary in the summer that the IAEA has &quot;enough material to ask questions.&quot;
The Syrians very quickly disposed of the rubble of the alleged &quot;disabled military building&quot; and thoroughly paved the ground.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium traces in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, from commercial vendors in the moments just after the attack, which must have a greater informational value than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria always hinted that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA dismissed it as implausible after the particle analyzes.
Since then Damaskus has refused to argue about it, just as with satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are prohibited from a second inspection at el-Kibar and from entering the ruins of the bombed-out building.
Israel, too, is strictly silent.
&quot;We will never comment on it,&quot; Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and &quot;progressively becomes a serious credibility problem for the authorities&quot;, as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place at the IAEA in Vienna, he is finally pending a serious violation against the atomic weapons non-proliferation treaty, overseen by the IAEA.
The IAEA considers three more pieces of equipment as the key to progress in the clarification, which must be &quot;in functional connection&quot; with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not disclosed publicly so far what equipment they are, or what functions they have, or if they seem suspicious.
According to the Süddeutschen Zeitung newspaper, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as interns, again derived from the proximity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with the satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located on or immediately next to a military base, Syria for this reason bans IAEA entry to all three locations.
In Vienna, Syrians are said to fear a search that the US has requested from the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were on the alert for the equipment thanks to warnings from the US secret service.
Using satellite photographs, the IAEA has evidence that material is moving between the three locations and the cube to the shore of the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna claimed that at least one of the teams may be &quot;related to fuel production.&quot;
But there is &quot;no indication of sensitive activities&quot;, neither of enrichment of uranium nor of reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
Where the uranium should come from and where the plutonium should subsequently be separated for the bombs, for these core questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no question whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in all three locations.
As hundreds of truckloads disappeared from the ground, no one has information on where the rubble remains.
The OIAE considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located a few kilometers from el-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, unlikely, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste area.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of the satellite images for the prestigious Jane&#39;s Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show that the Syrians carried out earthworks at the three suspected suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which the Syrians allowed, to maintain possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors&#39; interest.
Meanwhile, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter does not have much urgency, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador wields the calls exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of &quot;an option to which I am open in the future&quot;, but he still hesitates.
This path is very risky: This requires the majority of the IAEA&#39;s governing council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected: &quot;What if they find nothing in the end?&quot;
Love in times of war
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the direction of her debut as yet unnamed.
She has written the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much else is known about it, but this is enough for the stir.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women&#39;s associations have quickly protested, moving at the last minute some planned shooting days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the women&#39;s organization for war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, informed a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the UN High Commissioner&#39;s ambassador for refugees.
She is not a diplomat, weeks ago the women offered her a meeting in Hungary that she refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
There are no love stories given in the rape camps, and Jolie&#39;s position on the matter gives the victims away enough about the script.
Her organization in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended removing Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly has Jolie written for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, after a tug-of-war granted a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie didn&#39;t go anyway.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she enters with great effort in the Yugoslav conflict, she wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains imprecise.
A second synopsis of the film circulates online that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the start of the war and meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant &quot;rape victim falls in love with torturer&quot;.
It is certain that the Jolie movie actually begins before the war.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is &quot;unfair and based on misinformation.&quot;
Currently they can make peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script is still on the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish again.
No trace of affliction
Instead, the home team dominates over its clients in Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans cheer for joy as loud music blasts, stamping their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the South Irish Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called &quot;Beerpong&quot;, and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a plane ticket to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a laid-back guy, this quirky drinking game and low-key computer scientist don&#39;t really hit it off.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with it, to distract himself from the withering question, what the future holds.
Fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
&quot;I have a bad feeling,&quot; he says.
&quot;It&#39;s a long way from home and I don&#39;t have a job there yet.&quot;
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, &quot;in one fell swoop he got his dream job as an event manager, maybe that&#39;s a good sign,&quot; says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanners&#39; three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin is currently working as an IT consultant in London.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, predict economic experts and the ESRI institute for social research in Dublin.
Until 2015 there are 200,000 emigrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, a migratory wave is coming, comparable to that suffered by the island in the eighties.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, now the melancholy is spreading.
The economic crisis especially confuses the young, well-educated Irish, for whom, until now, everything is uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the editor en masse from young emigrants, who complain that: &quot;In Ireland everything is sinking.&quot;
&quot;There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, leaves and loses our country and with it a whole generation.&quot;
&quot;The last one to close the door.&quot;
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Student Union, sees a bleak future looming as the government only spends montage and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
&quot;They reduce minimum wages, but they don&#39;t have strategies to get new jobs,&quot; says the 20-year-old.
Observe how your classmates go from one non-resumed practice to the next.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
&quot;This idea is sad and depressing.&quot;
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue in a positive light.
McLarnon organizes the &quot;WorkingAbroadExpo&quot;, a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
&quot;For those who are starting to work, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career,&quot; says the manager.
Photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another boy snowboarding in Canada appear on his website.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, but it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O&#39;Donovan has known what it&#39;s like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was no longer anything for the 29-year-old engineer to do, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
Now they set up a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O&#39;Donovan sees his homeland only rarely because he works overtime to pay off a loan for his home in Ireland.
&quot;The situation is a little crazy,&quot; he says, since it is a long time since he first stepped on the threshold of his house.
&quot;I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am never so good.&quot;
He laughs somewhat embarrassed and leaves for freezing rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with manicured gardens in front of the houses, large and expensive cars are parked at the entrance.
O&#39;Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
&quot;They were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions,&quot; he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O&#39;Donovan thinks for a while, pours more hot tea, and says, &quot;I have no children to feed and I am young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch.&quot;
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he hears often today.
&quot;No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by far, as dramatic as in the past here on the island,&quot; he says.
&quot;Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps with it we feel like Irish for the first time.&quot;
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
&quot;After seven years he came back and life continued in Ireland, very simple.&quot;
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He already worked in London for a couple of years and why wouldn&#39;t he and his girlfriend do well in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that worries him greatly: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could degenerate into a going-away party.
&quot;Just, not too many emotions,&quot; he says and takes a big gulp of his beer.
&quot;Farewell, it sounds very distressing.&quot;
&quot;We better call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games.&quot;
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does support for private companies.
Crime is of greater concern than unemployment.
Furthermore, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows for monitoring of attitudinal changes in the region.
Two related issues stand out in the results of this year&#39;s survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the relatively lively humor that prevails in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a reduced 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a large decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which is lower than the regional average (see figure 2).
About 44% of respondents in the region said they were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than the 25% registered in 2001 (Figure 3).
Around 34% said they trust their country&#39;s Congress and 45% their government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher in relation to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has persisted during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social safety net has contributed to protecting the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only marginally in 2009 and has dropped again this year, to 32%.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see figure 4).
Brazil&#39;s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general feeling of progress.
Such sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since the surveys began, more respondents in Latin America cite crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Figure 5).
About 31% say they or a close relative have been the victim of crime in the last year, a figure that has dropped from 38% last year and is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The more positive economic returns are reflected in greater support for private companies and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private companies are essential for development, while in 2007 it was only the 56% (see figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of those surveyed in Venezuela think the same (and 80% support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that exercises the greatest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of those surveyed (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections thrown away
No one expected the general elections held on November 28 in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went far worse than foreigners trying to help the country come back from its troubles feared.
Votes were entered in the polls, some people voted several times, ballots thrown in the gutters, polling stations destroyed, and acts of intimidation.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to figure out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the election to be annulled.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
Nonetheless, Edmond Mulet, the highest ranking United Nations official in Haiti, declared that it was &quot;a relatively good election in many ways.&quot;
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that &quot;we do not believe that these irregularities, no matter how serious, necessarily invalidate the process.&quot;
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is beholden to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The tiebreaker is expected to take place in January.
All hope regarding the elections has not yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition calling for the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has little, if any, support has advanced to the second round.
Considering that the cholera epidemic is sweeping the country and more than a million of the survivors of the earthquake continue to live in tents, a large abstention is expected.
Eventually, many Haitians wanted to vote but were unable to do so due to a lack of organization.
Around 250,000 identity documents, necessary for voting, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
The stakes are high.
Aid donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an essential step in rebuilding Haiti.
And, as has become clear, the Haitians themselves think so too.
Tiptoeing to the center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rating by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level that he has registered since his election in 2007.
Regardless, whether it can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year&#39;s elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fernández sets aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the additional income at their discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernández&#39;s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner&#39;s death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the ruling Peronist movement have clashed with Mrs. Fernández.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one deputy punched another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
&quot;I am not going to argue,&quot; said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore be applied to next year, giving the president even more leeway when it comes to spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it will probably grow as much as 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the unions, put it around 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who came to power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, put pressure on the private sector, and had INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now moderate these policies?
He has called meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been boosted by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports around the world.
However, inflation has limited the growth momentum achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason Mrs. Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina&#39;s financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with the bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs. Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes around 6.7 billion dollars.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not imply IMF supervision, as is usual.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer &quot;technical assistance&quot; to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems the prelude to the cleanup of INDEC.
It is not clear if President Fernández wants to continue in politics when her term ends, taking into account that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has grown weary of Kirchnerism.
When Argentines return from their summer vacations in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have subsided.
If she wants to win other elections, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate many of her husband&#39;s policies with ease.
Half hooray for China
Voters in Taiwan are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, turned out on November 27 to elect the mayors and councilors of five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become a champion of sentiments for the mainland, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just barely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to obtain a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (PPD), which has favored full independence from Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes compared to 45% for the KMT.
If it had been the presidential, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party&#39;s vote share has dropped by around 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the municipalities.
The elections featured the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with little flags and scantily clad girls dancing.
There was also the rigorous mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, Honorary Chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the elections.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The funny thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not addressed.
Instead, the candidates discussed public accommodation plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests the military threat from China.
Consequently, the KMT often avoids publicizing its ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, too, the PPD avoided encouraging anti-China sentiment.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan&#39;s economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma stated that his policy towards China had been confirmed to be acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
You would certainly like to achieve political integration as well, but first things first.
The best thing will be to wait for the 2012 presidential elections to pass.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago it was in a bad situation: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned on charges of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, he openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Ms Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been warmly welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing its best to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans to create a group of experts to act as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a &quot;reliable alternative&quot; to Mr. Ma&#39;s rash approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious at the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he claimed that the PPD candidates would have fared better if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen interceding, the PPD will have a difficult time choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT must also do an examination of conscience.
Mr Ma&#39;s valuations have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesperson says it will restructure its cabinet, as well as local teams.
Large PPD samples suggest that Taiwan&#39;s support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, &quot;the point of no return has already been crossed.&quot;
Grammy Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise pick in the Breakthrough Artist category.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will notice you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys surprises this year with a top-notch nomination at the Best New Artist category.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, &quot;Esperanza,&quot; the nomination is food for thought, but respects the Grammys&#39; rules that you must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that &quot;determines the public identity of said artist.&quot;
His ambitious 2010 album &quot;Chamber Music Society&quot; was certainly a breakthrough and, considering his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as great skill with influences from pop, funk and Latin rhythms, it can at least be established. a distinction between Spalding and Norah Jones&#39; path to success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammys voters, who have lately been concentrating on jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio&#39;s &quot;Historicity,&quot; an exciting and magnificent record that was a favorite last year.
Among Iyer&#39;s competitors is veteran saxophonist James Moody with &quot;Moody 4B&quot; and keyboardist John Beasley for &quot;Positootly.&quot;
Trombone Shorty, a raucous New Orleans favorite and a regular guest on HBO&#39;s &quot;Treme,&quot; was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest leans considerably toward fusion as on Stanley Clarke&#39;s John McLaughlin albums. and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James&#39; savage punk Argue&#39;s Secret Society garnered deserved recognition in the large group category, competing against the great chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, &quot;Pathways,&quot; It was a great example of the bassist&#39;s democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Directing Classical Albums
Classical music nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and songwriters from around the world.
Top nominations went to Michael Daugherty for &quot;Deus Ex Machina,&quot; for piano and orchestra, five movements, and Steve Mackey for &quot;Dreamhouse,&quot; an eclectic three-movement work for orchestra.
Nominees with ties to Southern California include Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, &quot;Los Angeles,&quot; a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are divided into thirteen categories spanning orchestral, opera, choral, and solo albums.
The Classic Producer of the Year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
Nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot; and &quot;Metropolis Symphony&quot; of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for &quot;Dreamhouse&quot; from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; &quot;Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati&quot; by various artists; and Verdi&#39;s &quot;Requiem&quot; of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for &quot;Lulu&quot; from the Royal Opera House Orchestra; Adolf Hasse for &quot;Marc Antonio e Cleopatra&quot; by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for &quot;L&#39;Amour de Loin&quot; from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for &quot;The Enchanted Wanderer&quot; from the Mariinsky Theater orchestra and choir; and Arthur Sullivan for &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.

Pärt&#39;s Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece is nicknamed &quot;Los Angeles&quot; and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman&#39;s &quot;Mandolin Concerto&quot; is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for Avi Avital to play on the mandolin, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
&quot;He composed it with Middle Eastern sounds and numerous North African scales and rhythms,&quot; Dorman said in a telephone interview.
85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez was nominated in the Orchestral Performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky&#39;s works.

In the classical mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of &quot;Roots - My Life, My Song.&quot;
Proposed Mosque in Temecula Gets Ordering Commission Approval
The mosque project for Temecula has garnered the unanimous support of the local law commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project, saying it encourages terrorism and traffic jams.
However, commission members decided Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local law and would be aesthetically impressive.
&quot;Many good people came to show their support, both Christian and Jewish or Baha&#39;i, of all faiths,&quot; Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, said Thursday morning.
&quot;The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud.&quot;
&quot;Show that justice prevails.&quot;
&quot;The opposition is really minimal,&quot; he adds.
&quot;They just speak very loud.&quot;
&quot;In this valley there are wonderful people.&quot;
The meeting started at six in the afternoon and lasted until almost midnight; most of the time was spent with people who were advocating for or against the center, roughly the same number on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper&#39;s website.
&quot;The United States no longer exists,&quot; reads one of the comments.
&quot;This is another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand.&quot;
&quot;America has fallen.&quot;
Plans to build Islamic centers have sparked protests in other parts of the country as well, including near ground zero, the part of New York where the September 11, 2011 attacks took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families had been living together without problems in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse he was renting on a property shared with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, in a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the Municipal Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth ... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that life forms may exist without the main elements they considered essential.
&quot;This organism has a double capacity.&quot;
&quot;It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic.&quot;
&quot;That makes it very peculiar, although it is close to being a really &#39;alien&#39; kind of life,&quot; said Paul CW Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in Thursday&#39;s online edition of the journal Science.
It has long been considered that there are six major elements essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
&quot;It makes you wonder what else is possible,&quot; said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated much speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It did not.
What the discovery &quot;does show is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of&quot; standard &quot;elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be so fixed,&quot; said Charles Cockell. , Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the investigation team.
&quot;This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure,&quot; Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA&#39;s Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could substitute one for the other.
&quot;Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus.&quot;
&quot;As a result, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate between them.&quot;
&quot;However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn&#39;t work as well as phosphorus, so it goes in and, so to speak, weighs down the biochemical machinery,&quot; Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they adapted to and used to grow.
The microbe grows best on phosphorus, but proving that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that an arsenic-using life form may exist naturally, either in other parts of the world or on another planet. or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that phosphorus can be substituted for arsenic is not new, but an example has never been found to show that it works.
Arsenic was more common in Earth&#39;s early eras, he noted, so the researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
&quot;It does suggest that there might be other means of generating life, not just the way life formed on Earth in ancient times,&quot; said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy, and the National Institutes of Health.
Missing stolen dogs found in Compton
The two missing dogs of the four stolen have been found outside the Bellflower motel, Los Angeles County sheriff deputies said Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis, went missing Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck they were spending the night in outside the Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found late Wednesday night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#39;s Department.
&quot;The good news is that the dogs are fine,&quot; Whitmore said.
&quot;They are in good condition&quot;.
&quot;They have returned to their rightful owners.&quot;
Whitmore declined to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
&quot;An investigation is underway.&quot;
&quot;We don&#39;t want to say anything,&quot; Whitmore said.
&quot;We are following some leads.&quot;
The dog&#39;s owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found for comment Thursday.
They were reunited with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff&#39;s deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not been harmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to display at competitions in the area this week on behalf of the dog&#39;s Japanese owners, were still missing as of Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC / Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and were planning to showcase Trace.
The other dogs were to be shown in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC / Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple&#39;s nearly two-month tour of dog competitions.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their room window.
They were taking three other dogs (a boxer pup, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany) who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have very thick fur and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van being stolen at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, as MGM&#39;s restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the plan &quot;pre-assembled&quot; by creditors to erase approximately $ 5 billion of debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on production. and premiere of movies and television shows.
Thursday&#39;s ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to relaunch under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become executives. main aspects of what will be a reduced study.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In reality, MGM will not exit Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $ 500 million loan facility to fund the operations and production of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the loan, which on its own is contributing $ 75 million, and is expected to be financed in mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management necessary to order its finances, while it struggled to be able to make interest payments of 300 million dollars a year .
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron President and bankruptcy recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Donuts.
Moelis and Cooper&#39;s attempts to resolve MGM&#39;s financial woes and satisfy the study&#39;s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $ 2 billion that creditors were seeking.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally endorsed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper&#39;s companies will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $ 1.2 million, will get a payment of $ 9.5 million.
Cooper&#39;s companies, which have been raising $ 375,000 per month for their company management services, will receive a &quot;success fee&quot; of $ 4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released just one movie this year, and assembled an annual slate of seven or eight films due out in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between $ 265 million and $ 275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM&#39;s debt, had been trying to arrange a studio merger with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to balance its gift budget
While the iPad is the leading contender for this year&#39;s most wonderful toy, followed by perhaps the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can put a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $ 99 each, and a Kinect set costs the same as 10 classic beaded jump ropes, or roughly 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, and BJ&#39;s Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $ 80.
It was immediately clear that Moore&#39;s Law has been working; This year&#39;s tech toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even slightly less compared to last year&#39;s.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with partner websites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button-battery-powered toys are on the rise, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, unless otherwise stated).
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $ 13, for ages 3 and up) are plush toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when their bellies are clenched.
One squeeze equals one note, and a second squeeze begins to put together a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start squeezing, you cannot stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $ 60, for ages 2 and up) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year&#39;s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic dummy plays turn-changing games like Simom Dice, and is able to moonwalk, thanks to its innovative articulated feet with locking device wheels.
The children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you are a kid from the 80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He&#39;s back (Hasbro / Playskool, $ 40, for ages 3 and up), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a car ride into a witty self-correcting workbook session.
If you are wary of giving your child your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech&#39;s MobiGo ($ 60, 3-8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; Although the games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($ 70, ages 3-12), it is the first major overhaul in the Leapster line, with a newer, brighter screen.
Neither version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price iXL ($ 90, ages 3-7) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot for viewing family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($ 30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a game of five blocks barely bigger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The objective is to make words by placing the blocks in a row before the time runs out; it&#39;s great for an impromptu word-building competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based solely on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2 &quot;Mix &#39;N Match Figure Pack, ($ 5, ages 6-12) that includes a coin with a hidden code .
When you redeem the code online, your child earns enough Club Penguin store credits for two items.
These could include roller skates or a puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than your toothbrush bristle, Hexbug Nano ($ 10, for 5 years and up) is the latest in a line of button-battery-powered micro-robots.
The fake bug moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.

A more moderate side of law enforcement is promoted in China
Like an urban drill sergeant, Tang Shenbin paced a city square, sternly inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan, China&#39;s burly urban law enforcement officers, feared and despised for their capricious crackdowns and penchant for violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of onlookers.
&quot;Stand firm!&quot;
&quot;Attention!&quot;
Show them, he whispered, &quot;what pretty girls are like!&quot;
Four girls barely past their teens in white gloves and identical olive green jackets and skinny pants to get attention.
Four pairs of perfectly lined black shoes.
Four stylish hats perfectly placed on top of hair tied with blue and white striped bows.
&quot;Personally, I think they look normal,&quot; Mr. Tang said dismissively.
&quot;The models are cute.&quot;
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China&#39;s urban inspectors.
One city mandated that all new recruits have a bachelor&#39;s degree.
Guangdong Province changed the gray-green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating looks: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a wayward snack cart, frowning at it constantly for half an hour, until the street vendor He packed up his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, expressly chosen for their appearance, proportion, and youth.
The idea is to give the rough cop a softer, feminine side.
Sadly, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China&#39;s paltry respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors beat to death a passerby after using his cell phone to film them while breaking up a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a Beijing inspector training manual was stolen and posted online, describing how to effectively whip criminals without making them bleed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon street vendor suffered brain damage after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
&quot;Chengguan has left a scar on the government,&quot; China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded &quot;a really meticulous cleaning.&quot;
Skeptics say the current approach is a long way from this.
After the district solicited eight new female recruits through an advertisement in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered whether the women had royal duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district ad called for female candidates between the ages of 18 and 22, with a good figure &quot;and five harmonious facial features.&quot;
They had to be above average height, greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the job was physically too strenuous for women over 25.
&quot;Your image is the important thing,&quot; an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
&quot;First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine if they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc.&quot;
Then comes the temperament &quot;and the inner qualities.&quot;
The female chengguan are like vases, he said, adding, &quot;Besides being vases, they will have other responsibilities.&quot;
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to back up that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job postings for both genders.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
Whether this means being handsome is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, the handicapped or disfigured person should not appear.
&quot;We cannot allow a lame person or a hunchback to come to work here,&quot; Mr. Zheng said.
&quot;His image would not be good.&quot;
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with flushed cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn&#39;t think the accent on her looks is sexist, she said.
&quot;Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?&quot; he asked with a sardonic look.
His dimpled coworker Xu Yang, 21, said &quot;Our work should present the image of the city.&quot;
They are also not opposed to their part-time work, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply chasing salespeople into the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the squad faces a dozen or so street vendors who rush off on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many muffins or bowls of tofu as possible before being thrown out.
&quot;Mr. Wang, you have to go.&quot;
&quot;We have told him many times!&quot; Miss Xu said as a vendor escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle cart with garnishes of noodles.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
&quot;This is pretty much the same every day,&quot; said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his spare time.
&quot;Very routine.&quot;
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to seize merchandise from vendors.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the Yunnan provincial capital, rioted after a false rumor spread that Chengguan officials had murdered a vendor.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
For the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Plaza, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, as required by regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle was yelling rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before scowling officers elbowed their way into their vehicles and quickly drove off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men&#39;s squad, stood behind, his white badge turned upside down to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 and over, play a purely support role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
&quot;Sometimes we fight verbally.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes we fight physically,&quot; Mr. Li said quite naturally.
&quot;Most of the time it is the public that starts the fight.&quot;
Prosecutors will not press charges against Senator Ensign
The senator&#39;s attorneys announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges stemming from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the wife&#39;s husband.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair made national headlines last year and damaged his career.
The Ensign office said it was &quot;surely pleased&quot; by the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign&#39;s attorneys said the Justice Department had &quot;informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of its investigation and that it has no plans to press charges against him on this matter.&quot;
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics attorneys outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have conspired to violate a federal criminal lobbying ban.
Interviews, email, and other documents first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, obtain lucrative lobbying work to achieve the silence from Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator&#39;s affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted various political backers to find Mr. Hampton work and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
Because Hampton had recently been an Ensign aide, he was barred under the law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, came at odds with the so-called &quot;revolving door lobbying ban,&quot; which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections for personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, &quot;it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute,&quot; said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending government-investigated clients.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics attorneys said the department appeared cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its law enforcement section. public integrity, including last year&#39;s decision to drop prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens amid charges of procedural misconduct.
Federal prosecutors &quot;are clearly cowards,&quot; said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Accountability and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that brought up multiple complaints against Ensign in the case.
&quot;This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,&quot; he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign&#39;s chief attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to press charges against his client.
Ensign&#39;s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, &quot;acted in accordance with the law.&quot;
Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
&quot;I don&#39;t feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we think they made the right decision,&quot; he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to reverse an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $ 96,000 payment from Ensign&#39;s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to show that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got a job through lobbying thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign Chief of Staff John Lopez contacted Hampton and told him he was &quot;hammering&quot; the Home Office on an issue. in dispute.
Ensign also attended a luncheon with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the secretary of transportation to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after it had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first broke last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, the Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that it planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesperson Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, she said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department&#39;s lead and conclude its investigation.
&quot;Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada,&quot; he said.
Cheshire&#39;s appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them &quot;chatting&quot; in the lines of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the gruesome testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three family members from Cheshire, Connecticut, is set to come to an official end, with the judge&#39;s imposition of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes&#39;s attorneys have filed briefs in court outlining the arguments of the appeals that are likely to occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reporting on the process, including the extensive use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created &quot;a circus atmosphere&quot;, and such widespread and immediate saturation with exalting detail caused public passions exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appellate judges to grapple with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
&quot;Based on what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual&#39;s rights to fair trial,&quot; said Thomas J. Ullmann, lead attorney for the defense of Mr. Hayes.
Trial Court Judge Jon C. Blue of the State Superior Court laconically dismissed the claims in a ruling last week, saying the news media was &quot;carefully controlled&quot; and that there was no evidence that the jury was brought up. for passion.
But it probably won&#39;t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that coverage of high-profile cases can raise questions about the fairness of a process.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the United States Supreme Court reversed the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, Sheppard v. Maxwell, that there was &quot;a carnival atmosphere in the process&quot; due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the television show and movie &quot;The Fugitive.&quot;
Some attorneys said that the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes&#39; conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be necessary to control the form of communication from courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time. of Dr. Sheppard&#39;s case.
&quot;There is general cause for concern about the impact of new media&quot; on high-profile prosecutions, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who studied Connecticut&#39;s death penalty and wrote a report in which it was said that it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes&#39; attorneys, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense attorneys also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test potential jurors&#39; reactions, showing them lurid photos of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense attorneys say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and maintain that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that it had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for its bizarre decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But your arguments about the effect of intense coverage of the process may attract most of the interest.
They noted in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the US Senate.
They argued that the media continually fueled the fire with emotion over the case.
&quot;The daily agglomeration of tweets from the media, cameras and reporters outside of court,&quot; the attorneys wrote, &quot;was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps across the state.&quot;
His focus on Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly was a Luddite view that would make the court&#39;s policy on controlling coverage weak in future proceedings. .
But some lawyers said appeals courts were often drawn to arguments about adaptation that was required in court due to social and technological changes.
Hayes&#39; attorneys are pushing for that claim.
In their brief, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, overturning Dr. Sheppard&#39;s conviction due to coverage of the process, and made clear that they would demand that new media require new rules.
&quot;This case,&quot; they wrote, &quot;represents the Sheppard v. Maxwell case of the 21st century.&quot;
Can civility bridge the gap to bridge the gap?
After a notable campaign of invective and negativity, this week has sparked a bit of civility in Washington.
Is it a harbinger of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday&#39;s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders did not produce any progress on the big issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what everyone is saying, it was at least a polite discussion of the two sides&#39; differences, as well as an acknowledgment of their shared responsibilities to rule, rather than just another empty episode to score partisan points.
Wednesday&#39;s public meeting of the president&#39;s deficit committee was equally civilized, despite remaining political differences among members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates the members.
That&#39;s just enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are on a probationary period, probing each other for signs of cooperativism and commitment, as they try to assess the limits of public opinion and voters&#39; patience for a renewed partisan war.
Reason why Tuesday&#39;s meeting and subsequent evaluations of it by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deeply ingrained to suggest any rapid change in climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxes, expenses, healthcare, or welfare, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Still, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
&quot;There is no question that things have changed in terms of the way you say things,&quot; said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
&quot;They are inevitable after the elections.
The elections arouse party passions, which are later extinguished.
That&#39;s good&quot;.
On some issues, particularly those on the outgoing session agenda, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
The Bush tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans cannot make believe that they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday&#39;s meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution cautions that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th. Congress meets in January.
On the contrary, he affirmed that it is very probable and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
&quot;After the things that need to be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will revert the situation to one of confrontation,&quot; he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) that civility can lead to true cooperation.
&quot;I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012,&quot; he said.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, who were instrumental in its creation.
As aware as Republican leaders are of the dangers of overstating their position, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut state spending and overturn the new healthcare law.
Those party lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the deficit commission&#39;s recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes and the retirement age, and cutting spending.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, by their own estimation, have forced the deficit issue onto the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been struggling to get close to that number.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel, suggesting that on fiscal matters there is, at least currently, little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between Republicans in the White House and those in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as it did in 1995, then both parties will carefully watch the reaction of the people.
Whoever they think is losing is likely to change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there appears to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility on display this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven for corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a &quot;kleptocracy,&quot; and it leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money it collects directly to the Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service are reported to operate huge blackmail schemes, helping to explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each stratum of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the &quot;vertical authority,&quot; takes its part as money moves up the ladder.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and he blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who own a major construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when asked by a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he said: &quot;It&#39;s crazy, a hoax, a bummer.&quot;
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details spelled out as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
&quot;The direct links of the Moscow city government with criminality have led some to call it &#39;dysfunctional&#39;, and to claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government,&quot; the note states.
&quot;Criminal elements enjoy a &#39;krysha&#39; (a criminal and mafia term that literally means &#39;roof&#39; or protection) that is passed on by the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD ), and the prosecutor&#39;s office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
&quot;Analysts Identify Three-Tier Structure in Moscow&#39;s Criminal World&quot;.
&quot;Luzhkov is at the top.&quot;
&quot;The SFS, the MVD and the military are at the second level.&quot;
&quot;Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.&quot;
&quot;This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services.&quot;
The report claims that the SFS collects money from larger companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report stated, &quot;explained that Moscow&#39;s business owners understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) since they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law. &quot;
&quot;For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.&quot;
The note observes that while money collection is complete, protection can be spotty; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don&#39;t pay quickly find their businesses closed for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken out several times about fighting corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
&quot;In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats,&quot; Georgy Satarov, head of Indem&#39;s think tank in Moscow, said in a recent interview.
&quot;But he is a part of this bureaucracy.&quot;
&quot;He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.&quot;
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $ 300 billion per year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the note from the American Embassy, which did not occur until late at night Moscow time, is sure to cause displeasure within the Russian government, and although Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow&#39;s weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin argues that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation claiming that American diplomats were calling him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
&quot;The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country,&quot; he said.
&quot;But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way.&quot;
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with stained and peeling walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School remembered the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
&quot;Everyone here loves Ta Mok.&quot;
&quot;He was a good leader and he cared about his people,&quot; said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as &quot;the Butcher&quot; for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where they still live. thousands of former soldiers of the organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a mixed court of the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years. from prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
&quot;There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but there is nothing they can do,&quot; said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
&quot;For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.&quot;
&quot;This is creating divisions within families.&quot;
During the Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-led government in 1979, remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia&#39;s border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated a following in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace accord led to the country&#39;s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the utter misery common in rural Cambodia, and many are nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their arms, the common soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
&quot;These people have made little profit after the surrender,&quot; said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
&quot;They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime.&quot;
&quot;They were raised with no concept to do business.&quot;
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before turning to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
&quot;Life with the Khmer Rouge was good,&quot; he said.
&quot;Ta Mok fed everyone.&quot;
&quot;But now life is difficult because we have to provide for ourselves.&quot;
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concern here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court&#39;s mandate is to prosecute top leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This did not do much to ease fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told investigators at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are thought to have died.
During a recent muggy afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden stilts on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the parched grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his Khmer Rouge past.
She stated that if the court summoned her, she would not appear.
&quot;Cambodia is peaceful and stable,&quot; he said.
&quot;If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.&quot;
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court goes after more suspects, although experts and historians question this.
&quot;Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,&quot; he said.
But facing the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
&quot;Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is putting the broken pieces back together,&quot; he said.
&quot;It is our obligation to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand.&quot;
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called &quot;A History of Democratic Kampuchea,&quot; at 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education&#39;s high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city&#39;s ties to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of its history.
But her parents were skeptical when she brought the book home to study.
&quot;My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,&quot; he said.
&quot;They are suspicious because they are not sure about the number of people the court will prosecute.&quot;
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to make an impact, he said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm here.
In the Dangrek Mountains, an overgrown path covered in discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot&#39;s body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cell phone salesman, said he didn&#39;t know much about the man who was cremated there.
&quot;But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him,&quot; he said.
It was Nuom Sothea&#39;s birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to Pol Pot&#39;s last resting place, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its reserve of qualified uranium for weapons
In a surprise victory for President Obama&#39;s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will forfeit its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the US government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But US officials told the Washington Post that a pair of classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the past two months, to remove 84.82 kg of weapons-qualified uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday&#39;s agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke anonymously due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
&quot;I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.&quot;
&quot;This shows that this process is working,&quot; said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the agreement is &quot;a very significant and important step&quot; taken by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material around the world for the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of all of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
&quot;We have conserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-grade uranium) and low-enriched uranium,&quot; Lukashenko said at the time.
&quot;This is our raw material ... we are not going to make dirty bombs, and we are not going to sell them to anyone.&quot;
&quot;We use it for research purposes, that&#39;s all.&quot;
However, Belarus reached out to the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said that the first task of removing the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly difficult, as the material had been lightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was carried out by plane.
The US government spent $ 13 million for the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the low-enriched uranium research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official working on Global Threat Reduction, said &quot;this was very carefully coordinated and orchestrated to build trust&quot; that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-qualified uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko&#39;s harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday&#39;s statement suggested a potential détente.
It was stated that &quot;while welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme for enhancing bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens. &quot;
The Spanish Government did not object to the CIA flights
The Spanish government did not object to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners headed to Guantánamo through Spanish territory, according to the US ambassador in Madrid in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then First Vice President of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested that the Spanish Executive be informed in order &quot;to be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance on foreign planes that cross Spain &quot;.
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe in which it accused a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting took place between former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice president acknowledged that the Council&#39;s report &quot;had taken the Zapatero government out of the game&quot; and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
&quot;De la Vega stressed that Spain has no qualms about intelligence flights through Spanish territory.&quot;
&quot;They simply want to be informed&quot; to avoid being &quot;caught off guard,&quot; Aguirre said in a cable.
The then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive &quot;wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity to influence.&quot;
For his part, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge&#39;s initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on the flights of the INC.
&quot;These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information,&quot; the Embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about the &quot;apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors,&quot; rather than the declassified information from the CNI or the Defense Ministry.
&quot;This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments,&quot; laments Aguirre.
In March 2007, at a luncheon between the US ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that &quot;although the Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate,&quot; he had instructed his collaborators &quot;to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature.&quot;
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the performance of the PP in this matter.
&quot;Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US government, &quot;he says.
The confessed parricide complained in the network of the &quot;burden&quot; of being a mother
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and had a blog: &quot;Terror a la gallega&quot;
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is &quot;Muki&quot; on the net.
With this nickname, which she has used since she was little, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the town of Coruña from which she is a native.
The messages are from 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through the testimonies of their relatives.
The young Galician woman, 30, began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get a DNA test.
It did not take long for him to meet another courtship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long period.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the job market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even came to accompany her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance was fractured, that they broke up.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: &quot;Alberto is very strange and pissed off, because I have come to work.&quot;
&quot;When I told him it was fine, but of course, now he realizes what it is like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do whatever he wants.&quot;
Then, he talks about a message to the mobile he just received: &quot;I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the child to you.&quot;
She complains: &quot;If you don&#39;t like me leaving the child with my mother, I&#39;ll pick him up when I get back,&quot; she alleges.
In May, he talks about going back to his hometown: &quot;This week I&#39;m going there, but I&#39;ll only be there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to show up for a job so as not to lose it.&quot;
He clarifies that if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
&quot;He will be with who he should, that is, with me, and never in my life will it occur to me to leave him again with anyone other than my mother,&quot; a doubtful intention given his bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When you type it, the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was supposedly murdered on the 10th, is assumed to be dead.
&quot;Cesar is happy on one side, but not on the other.&quot;
&quot;On the one hand he is with me and he likes the site a little, but on the other he is going to class almost every day.&quot;
Talk about a move to Mallorca.
&quot;He (the child) will go there to some summer classes, and that way I save some money from the babysitter.&quot;
The 17th, memories and complaints.
&quot;A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come.&quot;
&quot;Alberto says that he sent you I don&#39;t know what videos to the email, look how when he wants to find me, you have to screw yourself.&quot;
On the 30th, another: &quot;The child is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan.&quot;
Of Victor, his current partner, there is one: &quot;He advances me money.&quot;
On the internet there are messages from him on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
She even had one of her own in the now tapped MySpace universe, calling herself &quot;Muki the Ex-Prisoner.&quot;
&quot;Terror a la gallega (epigraph)&quot;.
The last man who lived with her, a juror, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
She doesn&#39;t want to believe that everything happened because she didn&#39;t tell him that she was a single mother.
Monica entered the Palma provincial penitentiary yesterday from the Menorca judicial detainee center.
The public defender, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events occurred, &quot;nor having any intention of causing harm to the minor.&quot;
Earlier, he did confess that he had drowned Cesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has its sights set on the general elections because, whether there is advancement or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in these elections it usually doubles the one it receives in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the regional elections of 2006, the figure rose to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC obtained 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend continues, which has been fed by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would confirm that the Catalan square is fundamental for the PP and the PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular ones, ERC would lose one deputy - now it has three - while ICV would keep one deputy or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular ones can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their replacement at the head of the Barcelona Provincial Council, one of the administrations with the largest budget - 661 million euros for 2011 -.
Both nationalists and popular people agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the city councils of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not obtain a majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes -.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced of being able to star in the turnaround in the Tarragona capital, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has been only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popular ones have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of towns.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the General Police Information Commissariat in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, provided passports to different Al Qaida groups, including &quot;Los Tigres para la Liberación de la Tierra Tamil &quot;(LTTE) and&quot; Laskar e Taiba &quot;(Let), the latter author of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Interior Ministry has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that the &quot;Kampai operation&quot; has &quot;weakened&quot; Al Qaida&#39;s counterfeiting apparatus at the international level and, therefore, its operational capacity.
The researchers calculate that the cell, in the two years that it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that their &quot;fighters&quot; can cross the borders of Europe and other western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence the investigations have involved, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that they may be taken into EU territory carried out in the next few days blows similar to the one developed last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another one developed in Thailand with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones who led the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists that met the requirements set by the so-called &quot;World Islamic Front&quot;.
That is, the documents had to be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, valid for several years and without stamped visas.
In the investigation media it is emphasized that, at the moment, no data has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the author of this attack, &quot;Laskar e Taiba&quot;, was one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that were &quot;invested&quot; in the purchase of mobile cards that were later used by the members of the &quot; command &quot;that killed 106 people.
The Police have seized abundant documentation.
The PP requires Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and dispense with philo-sovereign adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to propose in the middle of his term.
The president of the popular Catalans attended Artur Mas&#39;s meeting with the assurance of having obtained 18 deputies in last Sunday&#39;s elections, more than enough to be loved, since the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations that they will exercise the opposition abstain in the investiture vote.
The future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held will depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas is holding these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in a Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investiture &quot;it will be necessary to park all the sovereignist and independence speeches&quot;, as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to thinning the political apparatus of a highly inflated regional administration and the elimination of the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiation on Mas&#39;s investiture will be dealt with, by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home affirms that the deaths were not due to &quot;lack of measures&quot;
The owners of the Olot center do not rule out that their guard killed more than 11 elderly
Those in charge of the nursing home La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while he was employed there killed at least eleven elders in his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the center&#39;s lawyer, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that &quot;La Caritat&#39;s wish would be to be able to prosecute the person responsible&quot; for the deaths, but &quot;the legality and responsibility they force to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible &quot;.
And it is that in addition to the social loss of prestige that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the guard in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims&#39; families are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the order that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former nursing home patients - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but that, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure by phone.
The Charitat, through its director, flatly denied this point yesterday and pointed out that &quot;the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what has happened.&quot;
La Caritat&#39;s lawyer added that &quot;in the case there is not a single indication that there has been a reckless action by anyone other than the accused himself.&quot;
The one already baptized as &quot;Angel of Death&quot; confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and, a month and a half later, he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by injecting him with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he committed with the help of a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the center&#39;s staff have access to medicines.
Insulin punctures and the cocktail of sedatives would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyzes that are being carried out in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila is not lying and sought a less cruel death for his first victims or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside by giving them bleach as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the warden&#39;s manifestations, not even to the number of confessed murders, which they do not rule out that it is higher, and they justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his behavior after having committed eight successful murders.
That is why they say that they are brought to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to yesterday&#39;s threat from Trichet who warned &quot;the markets should not underestimate our ability to react.&quot;
Peripheral spreads have closed strongly and European bank stocks have risen more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the ECB&#39;s ability to be wrong, and the euro has barely rallied, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that, just as it collapses, recovers but is motivated by the closing of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take time to lose fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to be retracted tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
The Bundesbank demanded to end the plan to purchase public debt as ineffective and eliminate all extraordinary measures of liquidity in the term and leaving only unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures &quot;at least until March&quot; and to maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond buying program and even give the signal to step it up.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
As in their May meeting where they said they had not even contemplated buying bonds and the markets crashed, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday said he had already bought a lot, causing a further market crash.
Yesterday the auction of one-year bills in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million at 5.28%, versus 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment following Trichet&#39;s words.
In Ireland, the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole figures have been released.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and they have until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland does not have any credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still does not have enough support, so Ireland continues to be a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension ahead of the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14, in which a political commitment is necessary to show that we are one union and that we all play the same music sheet.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the Beethoven hymn of joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity when he presented yesterday the plan of measures to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment ring in the ears of investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Market has risen 4.5%, double that of the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will be resolved with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, asking for an Aid Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, three times that in March, at very expensive rates and it closes access to the markets sine díe.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar&#39;s wife, &quot;in addition to being so, appearing so.&quot;
Courage, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm does not abate in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it &quot;null and void&quot;, the judicial meeting of El Enebro on the 16th, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the owner firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services to the company does not seem willing to give in in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
He was dismissed from his board of directors by five of his seven children who were appointed administrators at the shareholders&#39; meeting of January 18 of this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Mercantile Registry.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next day 16, summoned by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of thunder within the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to set the meeting is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The latest movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a &quot;desperate recourse by the applicants and their five children to, through procedural trickery, in clear fraud of the law and abuse of rights, to treat to validate and clean up the radically null meeting of January 18, &quot;according to its official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for, once the meeting is held, proceed to challenge it, considering that it is &quot;null and void.&quot;
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group, however, claims the usufruct of 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the substantive issue that the judge must decide once the hearing on the challenge is held, for which there is still no date set.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software designs car improvements in real time.
Since Red Bull burst into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final stretch of the championship, everyone bet on the triumph of Fernando Alonso&#39;s Ferrari.
Without detracting from the ability as a driver of the finally champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that powers his car, in the world of Formula 1 the &quot;secret weapon&quot; that the multinational Siemens has become a legend. has put it in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from high-end car competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computing instrument has been used to design assembly lines for manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce and faithfully simulate the product or process before actually building it, thus avoiding avoidable errors and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon&#39;s cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan&#39;s most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this computerized instrument in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out &quot;in a few hours, almost in real time&quot;, the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the races and in the tests.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were capable of introducing a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
Today 180 highly qualified young professionals work in the Red Bull team who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and plan all kinds of modifications to the racing cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all the elements of Red Bull racing cars with the exception of the engine, which is entirely the responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation on this madness of technological improvement is the figure of 40 million dollars that each Formula 1 team can spend at most each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its racing cars in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered &quot;top secret&quot;.
The staff for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two drivers, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull&#39;s Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose competition is inestimable and their notoriety is null.
The factory&#39;s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago you could say that R&amp;D advances in wagon cars accounted for 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science as &quot;they are unpredictable gladiators.&quot;
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first in the network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational company plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will make this initiative compatible with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the remodeled store located on Barcelona&#39;s Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has collaborated for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible openings, although he recognized that Madrid could be the next destination.
The also director of HP personal systems assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is in charge of the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of store personnel.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to &quot;improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, customer service, after-sales and even packaging.&quot;
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that is responsible for solving possible problems with HP computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
&quot;Thus, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days.&quot;
&quot;This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since large companies already have technical assistance services contracted,&quot; Helena Herrero remarked yesterday.
Sabadell is committed to &#39;stealing&#39; a million customers from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, the CEO of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a tough year for banks, but initially rules out a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will be partially compensated with increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes to attract one million private customers in three years, its pending issue.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 that will last for three years.
The objective, in addition to surviving without having to resort to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share by attracting a million new private customers -700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted-, its great pending issue, since until now it had pampered SMEs and companies more than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 individual clients and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the foundations of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Few banks in these times dare to set goals and make them public since the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close its Optima master plan this year, set four years ago, although initially it was for three years, but the market situation made it extend it for one more year.
Customers who miss savings banks will be their main target.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a &quot;difficult and momentous&quot; year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain &quot;will be slow.&quot;
In addition, in two or three years it will be &quot;very difficult to create jobs&quot;, something essential for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he believes that the war on liabilities -which penalizes margins- is being reduced, the price of the risk premiums that banks and savings banks are paying for their issues to obtain liquidity are already being transferred to the price of credit to compensate for the fall from the margins.
&quot;The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it will be a factor of pressure on credit.&quot;
&quot;We have not closed the tap, but the differentials are higher,&quot; Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto already gave orders to its network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of spreads - see CincoDías on November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend of banks now &quot;is to raise commissions&quot;, but &quot;there is a competitive framework.&quot;
Sabadell&#39;s master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he assures that in Spain &quot;larger sizes will be required.&quot;
&quot;Next year everything will move,&quot; he assured.
He affirms that the capital needs are &quot;raised a lot&quot; and does not rule out that some Spanish financial entity enters the red.
And he points out that the FROB can supply the market in raising funds in the face of new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he downplayed what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repos, which dampens the crisis.
The CECA rules out a second wave of mergers in the savings banks
The director general of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that a wave of savings bank mergers will take place and once again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several entities that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will take place.
&quot;I think that the largest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol to the Banca Cívica group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments.&quot;
&quot;Most of it is completely done; instead of 17 we may go to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have already been carried out and supervised by the Bank of Spain, which has also collaborated a lot in this,&quot; said the manager.
Speaking at a breakfast held by the Association of Executives and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is being undertaken &quot;as quickly as possible, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is taking place within the deadlines. that in their day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain &quot;, he emphasized.
&quot;Going from 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million in volume of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that is unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to comply with Basel &quot;, he highlighted.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that &quot;there are a series of rather unfortunate opinions about the slowness of the process&quot; that demonstrate &quot;a lack of seriousness and meaning&quot;, because &quot;what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before end of the year&quot;.
The director general of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and &quot;probably&quot; in the world, and attributed to those who question it a &quot;lack of knowledge.&quot;
The manager pointed out that, within the current economic situation, &quot;we can be very calm&quot; with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a &quot;very important&quot; concentration process and that &quot;is going to the highest possible speed. &quot;
He also recalled that Spanish banks came out very well in the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but has set the conditions for the entire Union.
The tensions in the markets have provoked a double governmental response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or suppression of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without benefits, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, of the management of the Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How are these movements to be interpreted?
Go ahead that Merkel&#39;s position is not an error in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turn of the screw in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of many of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible solutions to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines for transgressing countries, possible suspension of payments from some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans for fiscal rigor and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the forehead was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully lengthened the decision to rescue Greece.
Already then it was the object of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public and published opinion were very against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, again Merkel emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union&#39;s treaties, to make it possible to rescue a country and, at the same time, force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, having precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the Union reform process that makes those measures possible as of 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although now we have to take measures with which he may not agree very much, as of that date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries will be severely sanctioned, they can be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is signaling to us that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that has dominated Spanish growth in the boom years, they simply will not tolerate.
The stake is clear.
And we would be wrong not to understand it.
It is not just about bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand of us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these circumstances is fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil will give way to more calm.
And that we take advantage of the window of opportunity that they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood it this way and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday&#39;s meeting with large companies and yesterday&#39;s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, it has been opened I walk the thesis that you have to put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it does not seem that they are going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, that of leaving a monetary area that is too crowded with not very serious countries, cannot be excluded.
Then Germany can always tell us that it has already warned us.
Sports and law fraud
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but not the will to escape a penalty.
The expulsion allegedly concocted by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether or not such behavior is unsportsmanlike and if, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which their team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when taking fouls to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will already finish as the leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next game of the league, against Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean of cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned the team&#39;s coach, José Mourinho, with two matches, and the players involved with different financial amounts.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten, but followed, rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the aforementioned case is due to the fact that it has been carried out by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and that on past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history as a histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulations contradicts the principles of sport, that is, if these actions commit fraud of the law; Well, in effect, they are actions that are respectful of the sports regulations, but they seem to elude their meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they do to sportsmanship.
One of the assets that sports spirit comprises is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that these actions did not endanger, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these assets referred to by fair play is to prevent the offending players&#39; team from taking advantage of the opposing team in an unfair way, which did not happen either.
Now, the paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that they did not accommodate what we normally characterize as cheating or fraud, since their violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but that precisely his action tried to be the most obvious in order to receive the referee&#39;s punishment.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage offenders get on the intentional fouls examined.
Here it seems necessary to verify that the rival is not placed in a disadvantageous situation or benefit is obtained in the same match, since obviously the result of the action means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it is not a useful strategy for the next game either, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, since the team can be eliminated at the first change, and also with this action the players serve a penalty game and go to the second cycle of cards, in the one that the suspension due to accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, going through rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions do not go against sportsmanship, which is part of making strategic decisions that favor making the most of what the rules allow.
In the case at hand, the players did not act to evade the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding punishment or running away from it.
Although the border between ingenuity and fraud is blurred, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was about two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the transmission of the directive to provoke them was carried out.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reserves for the 16th and 17th.
Self-sustaining celebrations proliferate by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the nougat and the lottery, with the arrival of December the group dinners before Christmas also return, which continue to act as an oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but due to the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to attract the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or lunches, the interviewed businessmen and associations of the sector coincide.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year&#39;s calendar (when New Year&#39;s Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16 and 17) and hardly any movement for the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the lean stage began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners due to budgetary reasons.
In order not to do without tradition, many workers maintain it by paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer&#39;s association, to this day, does not dare to predict how the festivities will be this month.
&quot;People think about it a lot before booking.&quot;
&quot;He wants to go out but he has the alerts on on the subject of prices,&quot; he points out.
The business will go well &quot;to those who give quality at a good price and with good service,&quot; he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a notch with the crisis, so that the band around 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey in various downtown establishments, the collapse of requests for the night of the 17th was found.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a real boom in applications for that Friday, with the claim of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more advance booking, even since the beginning of November.
&quot;We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,&quot; they detail.
At AN Grup, which is the flagship of El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 stores, they remain optimistic after detecting a turnover boom since the second semester and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group emphasize that the 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends that pre-celebrate the holidays.
To their six group menus they have added a Christmas one, with 30 euros or more as the star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that invite their employees again and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat higher.
On the part of the Fecasarm employers&#39; association (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure), its vice president, Enric Gomà, hopes to begin to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that as a whole the reservations are &quot;animated&quot;, although the clients &quot;negotiate to the maximum&quot;.
Of course, the illusion for the festivities has not decreased, whoever pays, he indicates.
The Pakistani nuclear program raises great concern in the US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at &quot;a faster rate than any other country.&quot;
The Wikileaks leaks confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program causes in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer on the content of the conversations and the thoughts of the US diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, &quot;decreases&quot;, and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons &quot;at a faster rate than any other country in the world.&quot;
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - constitutes one of the main reasons for vigilance in Washington.
This is how the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists it in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Adviser, James Jones: &quot;The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials &quot;.
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and a reason to keep watch.
&quot;Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural standards, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear or missile programs,&quot; said the expert Yuri Korolev, from the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with his American counterparts.
The most novel of the documentation leaked by Julian Assange&#39;s website is the diminishing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, calling communication with Pakistan &quot;frustrating&quot;, argues: &quot;Transparency is often non-existent; offers of help go unanswered or discarded.&quot;
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that &quot;despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.&quot;
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it &quot;very clear&quot; to the person in charge that &quot;the Pakistani Army must end its tacit support for terrorist groups.&quot;
On the hunt for the Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a senior person in charge of the fight against terrorism to prevent new leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange where he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a &quot;red alert&quot; to &quot;locate and follow the movements&quot; of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Also, it is not new, but dates from November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer for the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that &quot;the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.&quot;
It was on the 20th when the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange &quot;with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition.&quot;
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as explained by the organization, do consider the so-called red notice a free way to proceed with an arrest - which must be undertaken by the national body police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange&#39;s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks has been willing to respond by videoconference to questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, whom they compared to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin&#39;s head of security.
&quot;This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution,&quot; the letter denounces.
While the world searches for him - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of her son - Assange remains unknown, but not silent.
On Monday he gave an interview from an unknown location to the editor of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
&quot;If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering US diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the US has signed, he should resign,&quot; he said.
His opinion was reviled yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described the request for his resignation as &quot;ridiculous and absurd&quot;.
&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,&quot; he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior person in charge of the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama&#39;s spokesman to downplay Assange contrasts with views that these days are proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the House National Security Committee in January, has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations &quot;to intervene and their funds and prosecute anyone who gives them any contribution or help. &quot;
Further still has gone Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to recant after saying that Assange should &quot;be assassinated.&quot;
&quot;Obama should target it and use a drone or something.&quot;
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former Arkansas governor and a possible presidential candidate.
&quot;Whoever is in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment,&quot; he said on Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winks to those related to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to overcome the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without a goal due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his threat of resignation is insufficient for those related to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can not cause him the headaches he had with other extinct streams.
For this reason, the leader of Esquerra will try to win over the new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national councilors of ERC will be able to pronounce on its continuity in secret.
By ballot, and not by show of hands.
If the Carodistas want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that a &quot;Bulgarian&quot; result would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand from the president something more than to put his position at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercós controls the highest body between congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive on a roadmap between now and May.
To do this, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will put to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for his promising to bring the congress forward to the fall of 2011, something that the leadership already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that &quot;polyphony&quot; harms stability and that his goal is to make, once and for all, the organization able to wash the dirty laundry from inside doors.
Along these lines, the article that the acting minister Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the head of Innovació took for granted that the leader will be endorsed &quot;in exchange for various objectives.&quot;
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first, &quot;rebuild&quot; the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the membership, that is, to include new faces that come from the sector related to Carod.
The second may be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assemblyism as an operating mechanism at once.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held by delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the management to review the assembly in a specific congress to reform the statutes.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years advised against facing the matter.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking, it may be a good time to pick it up and try to shut it down for good.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the count of MILENIO Estado de México, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the MILENIO State of Mexico count.
Among the murders are that of three women and the discovery of a couple of severed bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year there are 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases, the one of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca, stands out.
The subject had at least three shots from a firearm and the coup de grace to the head in addition to the feet and hands tied with cable.
The following day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street, in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
At dawn on Thursday the fourth, ejidatarios found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal toll highway, in the section that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Beside the body was a message allegedly signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old man was killed by eight bullets after leaving his house to start garbage collection.
On November 7, two 30-year-old men were killed by a bullet in the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc neighborhood, Ecatepec municipality.
In Chalco, with the coup de grace to the forehead, the corpse of a man was found on a lonely road in Colonia El Naranjo and under the body they found a percussion shell of a 25-caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Playa Golondrina neighborhood.
The emergency bodies conducted an exhaustive search of the other members of the body, however they were not located.

China Maintains Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets
The representative of that country at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, that country&#39;s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, he stated, in the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars in efforts to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this matter.
He said that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programs.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Law, which includes the objectives set in terms of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in coordination with state and local authorities, to achieve the objectives of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he added, various multi-year plans are underway or have already concluded, both financed by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries.
For example, he referred to the Program for the Efficient Use of Energy, which was implemented during the last five years and which received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the exchange of incandescent bulbs for savers and one more for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific advisor to the government of that country on climate change, said that China&#39;s efforts have been greater than is generally thought.
For example, he stated, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution in pollution.
Likewise, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the last five years and plans to do the same by 2020, he added.
Sticking to legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN explained that the former PAN leader has the right to go to the National Order Commission to demand what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to the law and that the former PAN leader is within his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is convenient for him.
In an interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
&quot;It is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission.&quot;
&quot;Mr. Espino has the right to go, in his case, via complaint to the Order Commission of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body,&quot; he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action will emerge stronger from the internal election on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be chosen.
&quot;That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach for the local election that was successful and met the objective,&quot; he said.
The PAN leader specified that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so &quot;we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary,&quot; we enjoy it and it strengthens us, &quot;he said.
He said that without a doubt the council will know how to choose the best or the best leader required by National Action for the next three years, hence it will hand over the baton &quot;to whom the council determines.&quot;
&quot;I have that absolute tranquility and openness, to any of the five I would be proud to hand over the office of the party president.&quot;
He predicted that the rebound that the party registered in the last elections of July 4 will be reflected in the next races, although &quot;it is not yet time to think about 2012.&quot;
&quot;For now it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task.&quot;
In this framework, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, hence &quot;many hopes and hopes are placed on them, and I am sure that Gabino will be lived up to expectations. &quot;
When questioned about the PRI&#39;s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech during the four years of his government, César Nava called on the PRI members to reflect on the six-year terms of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
&quot;If the PRI thinks that the Zedillo and Salinas governments were better than those of Fox and Calderón; let them start defending them; come out of the closet,&quot; he said.
He believed that the head of the federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, much less censorship.
Obama promotes law on Twitter in favor of undocumented students
&quot;If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,&quot; the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal account of the social network Twitter.
&quot;If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,&quot; Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyber link to a larger document that asks the public to immediately contact senators, as a vote on the legislation is imminent.
&quot;With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,&quot; he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation, unless the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding are approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that once the fiscal issue is resolved, a timetable can be set for the rest of the projects.
&quot;I think there is a lot of time ...&quot;
&quot;We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year ...&quot;
&quot;I think we can reach an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,&quot; he said.
The leader of the Democratic Senate Majority, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a &quot;closing vote of the debate&quot; for the Dream Act, for which the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted as of next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have stayed in the country for the last five years and entered an institution of higher education or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, requiring the participation of a handful of Republicans, at a time when pro-project organizations carry out intense lobbying to ensure passage of the law.
Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Yet at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against it, and only one Republican has voiced support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Therefore, supporters of the Dream Act require adding several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Florida Senator George Lemieux, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have stated that they will not support it another time.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the sore
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where the participants showed off the storytelling
&quot;That sex on the tongue I understand but ... the finger on the sore? What is expected of me?&quot;, Inquired the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of Los pleasures de la lengua, a cycle that he celebrates literature in Spanish and that this time he used the subtitle of his question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to El sexo en la lengua, he explained).
The finger on the sore ... &quot;puts us in trouble,&quot; the Argentine writer gently snapped to the public, mostly young people, who gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who, in search of knowing what the &quot;sore&quot; is, goes from doctor to doctor, of those who do not he gets answers although he does get clues in the same narrative thread.
She comes out of the infectologist convinced: &quot;patience is not my strong suit, it may be my sore&quot;.
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who clarifies that sore is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: &quot;the wound is the open real, the symbolic is the scar.&quot;
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded &quot;from the wound I only managed to know that the real is open and that it does not exist&quot;, but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very intertwined.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative that he entitled In Praise of Invention, where the finger on the sore is not named but is discovered in a moment.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, it tells of a famous sorceress, who touched clouds the same, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a maiden had lost, a narrative that turned to speak later America, the great novel to which he did not lack from the beginning his own chroniclers to tell it and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of what was told by the conquering captains.
&quot;Cervantes, who invented all of us (the writers), made fun of the pretended witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told with an imagination that lacked even modesty. &quot;.
However, he highlighted &quot;it is the crazy and the deceitful who best imagine&quot; and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that what is narrated belongs to one side or another, where fiction literature reaches its apogee.
He calls it in fact the &#39;Cervantine tradition&#39;.
&quot;By his inheritance we are what is told.&quot;
In her turn, the writer Mayra Montero limited and applauded the variety of interpretations that the FIL&#39;s invitation gave rise to with her round table El finger en la llaga.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed hers towards the great wound of social violence that is going through her country - and shares Latin America - as a result of the disputes over drug trafficking and sale.
&quot;I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated,&quot; he indicated, after citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment established between the author. and readers, and that in a &quot;chemical reaction&quot; of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized &quot;that finger on the sore of the writer committed to the writer.&quot;
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatism, forgetting &quot;that behind each statement there is a small no and behind each negation there is a small yes.&quot;
&quot;To be masters of our thought and to be masters of reality we have to qualify: and qualify often means putting our finger on the wound and annoying those people who are much more comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturb the powers that prefer a world in black and white &quot;, he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine ended up comforting himself with the runner-up medal, he has stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he fell 4-2 on aggregate to Toluca; later, in the Clausura 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a 3-1 aggregate and it was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Devils, Rubén suffered a setback again, since his team ended up tied 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he got into 3-1 lead with two chances to seal the title for finally three of his players missed from 11 steps and suffered the somersault 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore he does not want to suffer the same fate, he seeks to get rid of the curse and be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing it is the institution.
&quot;I want to be champion, I do not want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing,&quot; commented the helmsman when questioned him about the numbers he has against playing finals.
The previous final is very current, from which, he assures, he has learned a lot, &quot;the only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the Previous time, with two penalties to shoot, we were ready to run and I think that&#39;s a lesson, until the game is over we can celebrate. &quot;
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty kicks, something that does not worry him, since he trusts his players: &quot;One never seeks to reach the penalty shootout, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other way and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately fate made a bad move on us, sometimes due to nerves or anxiety of having the title in our hands, but it left us, that left us something for this final that we hope not get to that instance. &quot;
Romano has in his hands to stop being a runner-up coach and to taste for the first time the glory that titles give.
EU changes rules to obtain visa
People should go to the Visa Applicant Service centers before their interview at the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and so will the waiting time.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASC) prior to their interview at the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the biometric information of the applicant, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, among which are:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to make the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another one for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $ 140 for a tourist visa, $ 150 for petition-based visas (including temporary worker visas), and $ 390 for merchant and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
Because the biometric information will be collected at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section will stay there for less time than in the past.
Likewise, those who request a visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $ 26.

NASA to announce discovery of extraterrestrial life
The US space agency summoned the press to present tomorrow a finding that will impact the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will release tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could test the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as being in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When quoting the press, NASA assured that it will present &quot;a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life,&quot; which prompted speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures alongside us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of them becoming intelligent beings like humans if the conditions in which they live improve.
Apparently it is a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some way, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that &quot;yes there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know&quot;.
The space agency will announce the true scope of the findings at a press conference tomorrow Thursday.
The conference will include the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (Saturn&#39;s largest moon), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern &#39;bloc&#39; opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of &#39;bipartisanship&#39;, they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of &#39;bipartisanship&#39; to the camera.
Before starting the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, from the PRD; and Patron Montalvo, &quot;thundered&quot; against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, &#39;bipartisanship&#39; begins, because now it will be two people, from the same number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the PAN Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in their capacity as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, explained that with these reforms, in an institutional way, political marginalization on the part of the PRI and PAN is constituted.
He explained that in the coming days they will speak with the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, based on a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be subjugated again by both parties and with that the opposition coalition is over.
&quot;This is where (the opposition coalition) has come, is what I see, because we are excluded from any decision, not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.&quot;
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and that is why they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopoly, is now &quot;duopolic.&quot;
&quot;It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is eternal bipathism in Congress.&quot;
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other colleagues to make them more, the convergent added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from the PT, explained that currently the Congress has become a &#39;booty&#39; between two, alluding to the PAN and the PRI.
&quot;Before it was just one game, now they are dividing it between two.&quot;
Patron Montalvo, asked that the deputy&#39;s personality be respected, that he be given his place at the negotiating tables.
&quot;That not by dome agreements, leave out 5 that we will probably make 9 deputies, right now the five who see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify to find a place at the negotiating table, that is the theme that in the reform that they made that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform. &quot;
$ 200,000 more goes out for &quot;the provider&quot;
Mazatlán City Council pays another check to the questioned owner of an electrical material company.
One more check for just over 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical material company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of &quot;settlement of accounts payable.&quot;
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had anticipated that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this provider, which was observed by the Superior State Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed and, consequently, how many more checks remain to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
&quot;Nothing has been bought, it is simply being paid what is owed, like the rest of the suppliers,&quot; he said in an interview.
The last checks &quot;reappeared&quot; in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two from October 15, October 19, October 29 and this last one, from November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official State Gazette, as established by law when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used their services again. services.
The above, after the fact that on July 25, Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in Mayor Jorge&#39;s triennium Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos was paid by the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where he cashed checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urge to attend tourist sites
Tourist businessmen regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to poor conditions in the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the Mazatlán tourism sector asked the authorities to give attention to the areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected the fact that tourists come to walk and see the disorder and take out nearby businesses.
&quot;The politicians do not know what it is to close a company one day and they have no idea of the money that is lost, or else they would not do the works in such a long time and without due planning.&quot;
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
&quot;The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it by giving preventive maintenance and not just fall into the corrective,&quot; he said.
&quot;We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to maintain the city well.&quot;
There are other sites that also look neglected and incomplete, he said, such as the Escudo and the Venadito de Mazatlán.
&quot;Today, for tourists to come does not depend solely on promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions,&quot; he said.
&quot;Due attention has not been given and this type of event reveals something that is notorious to all, maintenance is necessary.&quot;
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, since they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is a tourist vocation.
&quot;Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be sorted first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination.&quot;
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa due to the various challenges it faces.
A Legislature of decent work and free of agreements between parties and the state Executive demands the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature was installed, made up of seven political forces, 19 deputies from the PRI, 13 from the PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergence and one more from the PVEM, which adds up to a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship are not repeated. or paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the recently released 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa due to the various challenges it faces.
&quot;We hope that the deputies really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to protect their own interests and become carnival groups of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary factions.&quot;
Hence, he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that move the Governor in turn.
&quot;We want them to come and do a decent job and above all committed to society and the sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections.&quot;
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of economic growth in the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
&quot;The most important thing is that they boost economic growth, that they create incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in some way will promote job creation.&quot;
As for tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give it the weight it has within the state budget to strengthen the state Secretary of Tourism.
&quot;I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the smallest budget and it is incongruous as an important economic activity and generator of foreign exchange and investment and that it directly competes with agro-industry.&quot;
In addition to the fact that it is required to label resources to triggering tourism projects and that contribute to giving security to the state and in updating the Alcohol Law that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Wanted a wizard king
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For his parents, the next Three Kings Day will be difficult to please their illusions, since their home is made up of no more and no less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live from day to day because the father does not have a permanent job.
&quot;Well, sometimes we find it tough because my husband doesn&#39;t have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes ... already in the afternoon I go out with the &#39;plebes&#39; to sell on the street,&quot; said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the children.
4-year-old Adelaida wants a doll or a bicycle, while her 3-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10 years old, has long aspired to have a &#39;monster&#39; car and for his little brother Jesús, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothes size for one year.
&quot;He (José Alfredo) told me, &#39;I would like this monster&#39;, but I told him &#39;let&#39;s see son&#39;, because it was very expensive,&quot; Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children, who were in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, is a size 12; Isaías, 10, is a size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears a size eight.
14-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be very helpful.

Fourteen alleged drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, there were a dozen persecutions in the framework of the dismantling of a network for the production and sale of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the production of the drug was carried out.
&quot;Around 750 Cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment destined for production have been seized,&quot; says Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse in the hours following their arrest.
They could face accusations of Cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have been produced after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
&quot;It has been the information provided by the public that has allowed us to carry out the arrests,&quot; says Mr. Ruel.
Around seventy officers from the Quebec Police Department, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
It will be possible to fight against clandestine migration without problems
The Conservatives&#39; bill, which the government says should solve the problem of boats laden with clandestine migrants, will surely face strong opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
&quot;I rely primarily on the Charter.&quot;
&quot;I am here with a party that has created the granite that you step on,&quot; declared liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting was held.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone coming from a vessel identified as the carriage of clandestine immigrants to be detained for up to one year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not endorse the bill because it points to the wrong target.
&quot;We are against it and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government does,&quot; said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD&#39;s critic on immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected with a stroke of the pen criticisms that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
&quot;The neo-democrats agree that measures be taken against those in charge of the clandestine boats and that is what we want with another bill, the C-35,&quot; says Mrs. Chow.
&quot;We do not support the Conservatives bill because it targets refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of one year,&quot; explains Ms Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position of playing politicians and of ignoring the will of Canadians.
&quot;The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country like a doormat.&quot;
&quot;They expect Canada to take firm action,&quot; says Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has communicated to the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request that a vote be held so that each deputy who is going to oppose himself later explained to his voters.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Although the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit had been announced by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation on this issue since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Consequently, Tuesday&#39;s announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It should be noted that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services held on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for Stéphane Bergeron, a critic of the Québec party on the issue of public safety, to call this ad &quot;a rabbit out of his hat&quot; and as &quot;a sloppy last-minute solution.&quot;
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence over possible future unity.
&quot;You&#39;ll see the results when we announce it,&quot; he says simply.
&quot;We are aware of this problem.&quot;
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public poll.
&quot;The more Mr. Charest persists in avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide,&quot; he explains.
&quot;The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest,&quot; explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To break out of this stalemate, he suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the Comptroller General to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
&quot;We must be able to extend the mandate of the comptroller general,&quot; he concludes.
Likewise, it considers that Quebec could grant the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the making in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Penal Code to better accommodate this type of crime.
This request appears to come from the prosecutor for the Marteau operation, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed for his part that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments in relation to this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to biker groups, although the Penal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Later, Ottawa pushed for the adoption of the Gangster Law.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several waterways are being closely watched due to the heavy rainfall that has occurred in various regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon at Shawinigan in Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred at Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, various regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Also, an additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected between now and Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations are added to the melting of the snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have washed away a makeshift bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflowing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security unit remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, according to Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Center, for its part, issued announcements on Wednesday communicating the strong floods of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
They partially blame Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback before the Canadian Council for Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding welfare and Haitians, as well as for his foul language on the radio .
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained &quot;inaccurate information about social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians, and foul language that should not be used. in broadcasts broadcast during the day &quot;.
The Council has also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued after a complaint from the Common Front of People Receiving Social Assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were not correct.
Presenters must report data that is reliable and not misleading.
In relation to suicide, the nominee Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life&#39;s problems.
&quot;The majority of the Committee considers that the disputed episodes of&quot; Dupont le midi &quot;have dealt with a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate way.&quot;
Consequently, in this regard, any blame has been dismissed.
The latest litigation concerned statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media confrontation that had elicited numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure if those in need were actually going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
&quot;I&#39;ve already served my three-day suspension up there.&quot;
&quot;My file has been clean for a year and a half,&quot; said the presenter.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the emission of foul language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio station has collaborated &quot;even more than required.&quot;
The consequences will be minimal for the station, which must, among other things, announce the decisions once during prime-time hours within three days.
A king of kung-fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montréal Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who excels in &quot;sanda&quot; (kung-fu &quot;full contact&quot;), kickboxing and and thai box, climbs the mats and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
&quot;I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria,&quot; explained Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance to the professional level.
&quot;In my case, I look for fights everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground that involves mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America.&quot;
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals in the Amateur World Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from October 23-30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
&quot;I have won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and thai box,&quot; he explained.
&quot;I am currently preparing to participate in the san shou World Cup in China.&quot;
&quot;They will invite the athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category.&quot;
&quot;In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto.&quot;
&quot;In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place.&quot;
&quot;In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009,&quot; he added.
&quot;The interesting thing is that I have been progressing in each competition.&quot;
&quot;At this rate, I&#39;ll be the first this time or next year!&quot;
The &quot;san shou&quot; or &quot;sanda&quot; is a discipline originally from China in which it is allowed to hit with the fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
The matches are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal only has to maintain one competition in his career, he will undoubtedly attend the great tournament &quot;King of Sanda&quot;, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
&quot;This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China,&quot; explains the nice boy.
&quot;It&#39;s like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).&quot;
&quot;It has been an amazing experience&quot;.
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
&quot;The one who has beaten me is a true professional,&quot; he says.
&quot;There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg).&quot;
&quot;The winners of the semifinals meet in the final of their category.&quot;
&quot;Next, the champions of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu.&quot;
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $ 450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the center of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained the most important contract, that of project management, without a prior tender, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec&#39;s decision to entrust the private sector with responsibility for managing this major $ 5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium won the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
For the Québec Party, the use of business consortia raises a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause a rise in prices.
&quot;This is a new method of collusion and of eliminating competition.&quot;
&quot;That is to say, people, instead of doing it in secret, now they do it openly&quot;, declared yesterday the deputy of the Québec Party Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he claims, he does not understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there has been a collusion with this contract.
&quot;I&#39;m starting to get tired,&quot; he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted &quot;dishonestly&quot; and &quot;lacking in rigor.&quot;
He noted that &quot;the least&quot; would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Typically, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already started and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without competition coming into play; it has been a negotiation.
Furthermore, the consortium formula is no longer the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula for consortia in the technical advisory sector is under investigation by the government.
A quick glance at Quebec&#39;s commercial register identifies more than 200 consortia, some of which appear permanent.
In this way, the Dessau company works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal entity, that is, Dessau.
Regarding the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that &quot;the territory of James Bay responds to a particular workforce dynamic and Hydro-Québec has specifically responded to it since the 1970s&quot;.
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d&#39;énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
&quot;If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher.&quot;
&quot;You have two options: you can contact the players in the sector and tell them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price.&quot;
&quot;However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people,&quot; said Mr. Laporte.
The contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $ 50,000 obtained by the Québec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical consultancy contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $ 449,783,344, including the $ 295,131,564 Énergie gérance contract.
Sylvain Simard has hinted that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are &quot;good acquaintances of the Liberal Party of Quebec&quot;.
Minister Normandeau has pointed out that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which &quot;finance&quot; it, before specifying that it is more about their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The &quot;green&quot; label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but deeply skeptical.
The Québec consumer hardly trusts the sustainable development actors, as well as fair trade brands and organic certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that defend a more responsible consumption abound, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that this even slows down their commitment.
Even if consumption of so-called &quot;socially responsible&quot; products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or their environmental advertising, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of the consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates that carry the products called fair, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that carry labels indicating that they are &quot;eco-responsible&quot;, points out the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians&#39; speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumer sector, currently supported by about a third of Québec consumers.
In fact, the gaps and the doubtful nature of the information make 46% of consumers reject this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they also distrust the supposed returns of ecological products or services that are being sold to them.
On the other hand, practically half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood stores and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, points out the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points out of a maximum of one hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to occupy the position of the king of recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment by caring about the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social conscience seems to be from outside the doors (of their car): in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, support cycling and walking.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to make a financial commitment to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex pos la Société Angus and el Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, which were waiting for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy back the eXcentris film complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent from Daniel Langlois and give him back his true vocation as a moviegoer, have not obtained it. they asked.
The government has agreed to get involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected grant, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would, in fact, be less than initial expectations; this could constitute a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a request for 12.8 million last spring, but since then the requests have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who heads the eXcentris dossier, submitted a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a last report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counterproposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
El Parallèle and Angus have until December 31 to respond to it.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a donation from the State should be completely discarded.
Let us remember that the Association of owners of cinemas and film complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, various representatives of the sector do demand considerable financial aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same, has carried the burden of auteur cinema in his premises in the complex for ten years, after financing his own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had managed to build loyalty among its clientele.
The Angus company and the Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, for their part, are promoting a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $ 700,000 to make their way towards the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues to screen films at eXcentris.
The aim of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, showing Xavier Beauvois&#39;s beautiful film &quot;Des hommes et des dieux&quot;.
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals they have received.
The veil of self-conscious Canada is lifted ...
The new US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers as the complex of Canadians with respect to Americans, but at the same time they reflect the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think about Canada-United States relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama&#39;s visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget passed in 2009!
The four new communications between the US embassies in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable from September 22, 2008, that is, during the full federal election campaign, recounts the extent to which the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
&quot;Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex practically inherent in Canadians when it comes to dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign). &quot;, write.
Consequently, he concludes, the United States is &quot;the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about.&quot;
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this &quot;deafening silence&quot; because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
&quot;Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, of a party and, even more, of the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting.&quot;
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d&#39;Affaires in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
&quot;His trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada will register deficits for the first time in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between 30,000 and 40,000 million dollars. dollars, &quot;writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is there a mention that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being replaced by the coalition or that the opposition parties conditioned its survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication from January 2008 signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image transmitted by the dramatic series broadcast on the United States&#39; CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which unsubtle references are made to Maher Arar, the &quot;No-Fly-List&quot; or even kidnappings for the CIA to carry out. energetic interrogations.
Another cable says that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to take in some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but that it depended &quot;on each case&quot;.
At the end of the meeting, they wrote &quot;you have delivered a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.&quot;
&quot;The Secretary agreed to review the file.&quot;
Finally, we can mention that tempers have heated up in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive leak should be &quot;killed.&quot;
In the United States they echo Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renovate lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) by an amount that corresponds to practically a third of the additional reduction that must be carried out. carried out to stabilize the planet&#39;s climate before 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of large concrete projects that the UN hopes will be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by compact fluorescent bulbs or, even better, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, it would be it would avoid much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary automobile fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that were to cut global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, a further 5 Gt of this amount should be reduced to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from getting out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat and the rest, that is, 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is reduced even more by two times.
Fluorescent light bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, like the ones launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a incandescent light bulb, which allows us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in one hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also be powered by rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above, they do not contain any mercury.
Various specialists have expressed their reservations regarding CFLs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not fluocompact bulbs, but coal-fired power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted with incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international program would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save one billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits announcement of election results
The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the &quot;immediate&quot; publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d&#39;Ivoire, given that the established deadlines have expired.
&quot;The Secretary General highlights the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately,&quot; highlights a spokesman for the UN chief.
&quot;He calls on all the parties in Côte d&#39;Ivoire and the institutions to show their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.&quot;
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has let Wednesday&#39;s deadline pass at midnight without the results being published, three days after Sunday&#39;s vote.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI had commented on television that the commission was &quot;still working&quot; to announce the results.
On Wednesday, requests multiplied in the world that the CIS finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, Gbagbo&#39;s side is counting on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of the &quot;fraudulent&quot; votes in the north, in the hands of the old rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N&#39;Guessan, campaign manager for the Ivory Coast president, has claimed that voter intimidation maneuvers carried out by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts Gbagbo&#39;s complaints.
However, Gbagbo&#39;s opponents consider that the highest court in the country is not neutral, since it is headed by Paul Yao N&#39;Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has deemed the delay in publishing the results &quot;unacceptable&quot; and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory. .
His allies claim that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put the icing on the cake to the reunification and reconciliation process of a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned the Ivory Coast political class on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the votes compared to 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% in continental territory (9.7% taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by data corrected with provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of unemployed stands at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the active population in continental territory and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate has registered an increase of 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter, but want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks for work and whether or not they are looking for a job.
The situation of young people present in the labor market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year ), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), that is, 482,000 people from over 50 years, a figure that rises to 6.6% with DOMs.
Stability of unemployment has only been recorded among people aged between 25 and 49, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS President of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the framework of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social assets, embezzlement of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
&quot;Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions that the magistrate asks him, not ghosts.&quot;
&quot;It is easy to persecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to demonstrate them,&quot; his lawyer, Florence Rault, had told AFP before his client&#39;s appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began to investigate and also imprisoned one of their close friends, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr Lucien Simon, the only thing his client has done is take care of the landfills that he has to manage.
As for the allocation of the contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, he does not know anything about it, according to the lawyer Simon.
In the framework of this file, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, has also been investigated since Wednesday for embezzlement and complicity, but he has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
&quot;My client has been able to explain all the facts that they have reproached him for.&quot;
&quot;The investigating magistrate has taken the explanations into account and released him,&quot; explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, they interrogated four other people and released them, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as indicated by the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) property, has been charged with &quot;influence peddling and passive corruption&quot;.
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for &quot;theft and embezzlement of public property by a person engaged in public service&quot; and for &quot;complicity in the embezzlement of public funds&quot;, respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini&#39;s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for &quot;covering up the abuse of social assets.&quot;
Among those who have confronted Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect that their companies have served to launder the capital of grand banditry.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 after receiving anonymous communications, of alleged fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that the investigations are especially focused on the allocation and operating conditions of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: Elisha has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for &quot;espionage&quot;, has kept the public in France in suspense, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of US diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own &quot;hostage&quot; crises in Iran (a small group of Shining Path).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not come in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the US justice for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he did nothing.
A diplomatic telegram drawn up on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled &quot;Iran: French comments on how to handle hostage-taking cases.&quot;
The Eliseo&#39;s advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d&#39;Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speak with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly held in Iran.
&quot;Make noise&quot;, they say, &quot;continually release&quot; in the media the words &quot;fundamental human rights&quot;, &quot;innocence&quot;, &quot;immediate liberation&quot;.
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
&quot;When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more frequently.&quot;
Because, once the attempts to negotiate through discreet channels are exhausted, &quot;silence will not solve anything&quot;, the Iranians are &quot;experts in delaying maneuvers&quot;.
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is &quot;a common Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail.&quot;
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day she will take refuge in the French embassy) &quot;will require the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians&quot; (230,000 euros in reward).
In addition, he points out that Eliseo anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that &quot;is going to increase.&quot;
The Iranians could &quot;in the near future detain another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,&quot; he says.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is released: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by decision of a judge.
The US embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which surrounds the clandestine Iranian networks for the acquisition of material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand constitutes bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier guarantees that it was not.
Eliseo, he says, not only &quot;has been greatly surprised by the judge&#39;s decision,&quot; but has also tried to oppose it.
&quot;There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice&quot; (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but &quot;the French government cannot annul the judicial decision,&quot; he says.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand is still under the &quot;close&quot; surveillance of the French intelligence services.
Elisha&#39;s advisor dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the US diplomat that the Iranian &quot;is currently in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy.&quot;
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elisha does not skimp on efforts, uses communiqués and organized &quot;leaks&quot; in the media to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an &quot;important&quot; and &quot;influential&quot; role in &quot;mediator&quot;.
Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and see that the manipulation pays off, since several newspaper articles broadcast the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions &quot;the media blitz of French officials.&quot;
Why such &quot;gratitude&quot; towards Mr. Assad, wonders the embassy in Paris.
&quot;Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.&quot;
Next, the document deals with the reasons that led Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The great communication effort &quot;aims to validate Sarkozy&#39;s policy of openness towards Syria,&quot; he believes.
A policy that began in 2008, which &quot;in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, had just been branded premature and undeserved&quot;.
By &quot;exaggerating the Syrian role&quot;, Paris tries &quot;to show Syria the praise it can garner if it plays a constructive role in the region.&quot;
The goal is also to &quot;sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.&quot;
The American embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: &quot;of course, we don&#39;t know if the Syrians have done something or not.&quot;
&quot;But anyway, we have thanked him.&quot;
&quot;At the very least, this should cause confusion among Iranians.&quot;
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Eliseo.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for having played an &quot;active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot.&quot;
Starting at midnight, Korean youth cannot play online
The South Korean government is going to adopt a law called &quot;Cinderella&quot; that will prevent teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, according to government officials.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, as indicated by representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family .
&quot;Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day.&quot;
&quot;We believe that this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,&quot; declared AFP Jo Rin, ministerial official in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he says.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of the young people so request, added the official.
In addition, it will make free computer programs available to those who request it that limit the time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the most &quot;connected&quot; countries and newspapers regularly report on various events related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the organizing countries
In the midst of the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee designates the organizing countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups on Thursday, a clearly political election where influence struggles and lobbying can reach take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue with its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan , South Korea).
The list of the personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies the economic and political interests that are at stake in a World Cup.
Backstage transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not weigh heavily on the 22 members of the executive committee when it comes to voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of their country, the birthplace of football, which only hosted the World Cup once , in 1966.
The BBC added fuel to the bonfire on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has exposed three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to upset FIFA and embarrass UK officials, who have launched into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The Head of Government hopes to repeat the successful coup given by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the Olympic Games in London in 2005. 2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England&#39;s brilliance against the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also have numerous strengths thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (World Cup in 82 in Spain, Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its soccer culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects for both countries could derail their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they get is to give points to Russia, which has become a weight outsider despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to go to Zurich and has denounced &quot;unfair competition in the preparation of the vote&quot;, in a direct allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
&quot;They are bringing up their dirty laundry, trying to compromise them,&quot; Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems the most logical favorites.
The world&#39;s leading economic power and home to FIFA&#39;s main sponsors, the country appears to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, who have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the concession of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by weak paid TV rights (based on time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had implied that he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d&#39;Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubts.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less so.
One command in the Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be a candidate again in 2012.
However, the evidence for this does not sit well with the mystery often associated with the presidential office.
Therefore, you always have to pretend that you doubt.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac&#39;s friends affirmed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision &quot;sometime in the fall of 2011.&quot;
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the deputies of the UMP, on Tuesday night in the Eliseo, the possibility of &quot;two terms&quot; has caused a certain stir.
Is it the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was simply conveying the facts, not an advertisement.
It is not the first time that he speaks of the presidential elections, with a humorous tone, in meetings of this type.
&quot;At worst, or best, of cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me,&quot; he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: &quot;Do not think that I am not considering what will come next.&quot;
His statements the day before yesterday do not bring him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
They elicit comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has come to the fore that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to open up.
Quite the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people in the PS to demand that the battle be organized ahead of schedule.
On the other hand, bad soundings.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L&#39;Express).
&quot;We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject&quot;, the environment of the Prime Minister has reacted immediately and prudently.
&quot;If you think you can lose, you will not be a candidate,&quot; says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
&quot;He will always think that he can win,&quot; corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of State Bills
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities of exit from the crisis or, at least, announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should end by the end of year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuance institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, supported the active role played by the ECB in favor of solving the debt crisis of the European states.
He did not want to say whether he believed that the central bank should do more, for example increasing its government bond purchase program.
&quot;I reserve my opinion for my European colleagues&quot; ....
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more eloquent in terms of his intentions, stating only that the program for the purchase of Letters of the State in the secondary market &quot;continued&quot; and that &quot;we will see what we decide&quot; during the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Treasury bonds by the ECB has doubled last week to close to 1.35 billion euros.
In addition, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday he would have bought Irish and Portuguese titles again.
In total, the central banks of the eurosystem have acquired securities for an amount of 67,000 million euros since May 2010.
Among market players, there is no doubt in the slightest that buying will continue (see page 29).
Economists also do not anticipate any significant course changes.
Although lending operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB&#39;s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited allocations of liquidity on beneficial terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to last for a few months today.
&quot;I do not imagine that he is going to significantly modify his program.&quot;
&quot;If not, it would run the risk of causing new tensions in the short term,&quot; says Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
&quot;It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011&quot;, anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the public debt market, &quot;the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these bonds so that the market remains stable&quot;, adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks&#39; exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institute has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
&quot;It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in the yields paid by the most fragile states&quot;, opined yesterday an important bond manager.
Because, if interest rates go through the roof, states will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government weathered the storm
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the ebb in 10-year bond rates.
A recovery of precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have stated that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as &quot;indecipherable&quot; and that an &quot;unpredictable&quot; weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached a record figure of 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy hedging contracts (CRQ) had shot up to 263 points, causing a some stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; by &quot;the turmoil in the markets&quot; and a possible contagion from Ireland.
&quot;The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland.&quot;
&quot;The bad news is that it is like Portugal,&quot; explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, its problem is the lack of growth and the associated stagnation of income, which puts the State at risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a jug of cold water for the government.
Italian growth is estimated to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% expected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2, 7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions may be applied after the holidays, for an amount of 7,000 million euros.
&quot;If necessary, new austerity measures should be adopted&quot;, says the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
&quot;The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time,&quot; says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
&quot;There is no immediate problem, neither in the short nor in the long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are less than those required from other countries. &quot;says Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, it would open up a period that is not very conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: &quot;I believe that we have already shown on Sunday, night and day, that Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, committed to defending their currency and of your currency zone. &quot;
Although it was relative, the easing registered yesterday in the types of the obligations of the European States has boosted the governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalization.
The rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s announced that it could downgrade the debt of Portugal, currently the most frequent target of speculation.
&quot;As in May, there really is a lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs heavily on banking systems,&quot; say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since &quot;the political rhythm is much slower than the rhythm of the markets.&quot;
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying their debates to strengthen the existing mechanisms for exiting the crisis.
Informal consultations between Finance Ministers most directly affected and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform Far Eastern investors about the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly paves the way.
The first EFSF bond issues are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative confided to Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in the funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries that are in the front line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organization of the labor market.
These reforms are added to the austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path from the one followed by Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid at all costs requesting international aid before applying their own budget corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they consider essential to boost confidence in a lasting way.
Lastly, the capitalist partners of the European funds are considering the options available to accelerate the normalization process of the public bond markets.
Passing through Paris on November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750,000 million euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again .
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an amount of around € 100 billion additional would be sufficient, &quot;preferably&quot; in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
The instrument exists for this: the European financial stabilization mechanism, currently endowed with 60,000 million euros.
Advice that European capitals could undoubtedly examine in detail.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 apartments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are currently on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, the heavy snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly in the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm, specifically between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d&#39;Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowfalls are strong enough to cause circulation difficulties and affect some economic activities, alert Météo France.
In the Côtes d&#39;Armor, access to several departmental roads has been banned for heavy vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
According to the gendarmes, the circulation in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, reason why they recommend that it is not driven except in case of necessity and has prohibited the circulation of certain TER vehicles during the day.
During Thursday, school transport has been banned in Picardy.
No specific measure was planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture &quot;urges all drivers to drive with the greatest care on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation.&quot;
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissy Paris airport and 10% at Orly on Thursday because of the expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends air passengers to contact their airline.
In Great Britain, Gatwick airport, south of London, and Edinburgh airport, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris metro: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in the Ile-de-France has reached its peak, billions have rained down.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23,000 million for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of 4,000 million euros.
On a theoretical level, this sum will be the one that will subsequently allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The amending finance law of 2010, examined in the finance committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices provided to find the first part of that money.
There are two modes: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in the tax on offices in the Ile-de-France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is &quot;for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris&quot;.
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: &quot;The product of this tax is 117 million euros a year.&quot;
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists &quot;to modernize it, increase its product and allocate said increase to the Société du Grand Paris.&quot;
How much would be obtained with this method?
Who knows.
Figures are not given in the text.
But it is far from 4,000 million.
&quot;It is specified that the fiscal resources are added to the 4,000 million euros of the allocation of funds that the State will mobilize and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses&quot;, we can read in the explanatory memorandum.
SGP is not surprised by this system.
&quot;From the moment that income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as we explained.&quot;
&quot;It will be recorded in the budget and used as needed.&quot;
The SGP estimates that it will begin to receive the 4,000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised 4,000 million are not included in the credit, can provoke a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks subject has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let&#39;s go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The &quot;extraordinary&quot; American revelations about Berlusconi&#39;s sexual habits only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and the sinisterly ridiculing profile of Gaddafi has long given ideas to artists from cabaret to create your skits.
The rule that secret files should only consist of public knowledge news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the occult not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms that that they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown&#39;s success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as the head of the secret services is lazy (or has little anxiety) (if it could not be, I do not know, editor of the Libération), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the American embassy in Rome to the State Department was the same as that published by Newsweek the previous week.
So why have the disclosures of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultured person already knows, that is, that embassies, at least since World War II and since Heads of States can call each other or take the plane to meet for dinner, have They have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, they have been transformed into centers of espionage.
Any viewer who watches investigative films knows it perfectly, we just pretend that we don&#39;t know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker could consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world greatly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the &quot;executioners&quot;.
But let&#39;s get into the true nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell&#39;s time, it could be conceived at full power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell&#39;s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that not even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power be endured that can no longer even keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); It is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without a secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but revealing, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton&#39;s secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power.
WikiLeaks has not done any harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it has done a lot of harm to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any confidential information online, since it would be like posting it on a billboard in the middle of the street.
But it is also clear that with today&#39;s technologies, you cannot expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than discovering if and when a Head of State has traveled by plane and has contacted one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my forecast is something of science fiction and, therefore, fictional, but I imagine government agents who move discreetly on errands with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned by heart or, at most, hiding some information written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology currently advances like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a corded (telephone) telegraph.
Videotapes (analog) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, going back and forth, discovering all the secrets of editing, whereas now (digital) CDs only allow us to go forward or backward from chapter to chapter , that is to say, to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the displacements that it entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques lead us back to horse-drawn carriages.
One last comment.
In the old days, the press tried to understand what was secretly up to embassies.
Currently, it is the embassies that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: France&#39;s botches in its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine whether the promises of rapidly unlocked financing (called fast start or early) made by developed countries have been honored.
And the French bungling has been revealed.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged to provide $ 30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged to contribute 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (that is, 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU put its best cards on the table to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a great complementary event, the distribution of brochures ...
The transparency operation resulted appreciable and was appreciated for what it is really worth: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released € 2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right track towards meeting its € 7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Accord, the money must be &quot;new and additional&quot; to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without undermining official development assistance.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what &quot;new and additional&quot; means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonization, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Currently, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission has taken the year 2009 as a reference: international financing is maintained and 150 million are added in three years as fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks for the year or level of official development assistance.
By contrast, France considers the funding for &quot;all new projects&quot; in 2010 to be &quot;new and additional&quot;.
In other words, no reference is made to expenditures in previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France&#39;s aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while pretending that it respects its commitment to &quot;new and additional&quot; funds ...
Another crucial element, the distribution between grants and loans.
Once again, there is no rule and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that each euro loaned is equal to one euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (frequently, projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro to be recovered as equivalent to a euro to be recovered. donate ... At most, only the cost of the loan for the country granting the loan (that is, the equivalent of an interest rate) should be computed for your commitments.
But France does not find such reasoning useful: it &quot;respects&quot; its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros) ; Check out the EU document to see for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to fulfill its commitment, France contributes only ten cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the true financial effort.
Spending just € 36.1 million, she manages to give the impression that she is spending 420 million &quot;new and additional&quot;, just as she had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) And in negotiations, since developing countries are not stupid ...
The early finance chapter is a relatively short-term minutia in relation to the climate negotiations as a whole.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Hopefully not.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But especially, France could advance the discussions on the stakes in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of &quot;additional character&quot; and the method of compute loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
Therefore, we are left with the hope of the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France&#39;s fast start-ups and their vision of &quot;extra character&quot; and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move the negotiations forward.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the ancient movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results &quot;do not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with&quot;, purchased the food that is usually used in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September. to consume a child of about ten years in four meals and a snack a day.
These model meals, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day), as well as the sweets, were tested in laboratories for chemical substances , pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances capable of acting as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
&quot;Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual chemical are not exceeded, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to possibly carcinogenic pollutants and / or PE is of concern&quot;, indicates the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as around twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a school snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in the food, in which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
Additionally, Russian steak, canned tuna, and even loaf of bread or chewing gum were flavored with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, tests found nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most &quot;nutritious&quot; with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk that these &quot;pollutant cocktails&quot; pose to the consumer &quot;is probably underestimated,&quot; the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed &quot;given the gravity of the situation&quot; to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop &quot;the increase in diseases associated with civilization.&quot;
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
