Four members of the Kemerovo group detained in Estonia and Spain
Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group in Spain and is known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky, was detained by police in Spain, according to the Post.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with court permission.
Yesterday, the court also took custody of three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspect is said to be members of the so-called Kemerovo Crime Society aged 27 and 57, mainly committing drug offences.
The alleged leader of a criminal association has been detained in Mija, Malaga province, Spain.
Three men were arrested on suspicion of being arrested in Estonia, one of whom is a leading figure in the criminal association, according to the data collected, and two are members of the criminal association.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles were clearly distributed in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug offences and thus generate criminal proceeds," said Mr Verte, head of pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case.
"We are not ruling out increasing the number of suspects in this case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement authorities in the past, and some have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish counterparts had been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation will show the success of the cooperation," said prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the CCC, said the arrests were preceded by a preliminary investigation lasting nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the year, the long-running work materialised and we held suspicions of crimes in Estonia and in Spain at the same time," he said.
Leis added that Central Criminal Police officers were assisting in the arrests in Spain.
For years now, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These arrests are yet another message to criminals that we will get them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the men who have been arrested may continue to commit new crimes while at large, which is why the prosecution has requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized as part of this criminal case.
Pre-trial proceedings in the case are carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organised Crime Bureau and led by the Crown Prosecution Service.
Slava Gulevich was convicted of racketeering in 2005 by the Tallinn district court and sentenced to five years in prison.
In the middle of last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after Nikolai Tarankov, then the underworld leader.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxider lord and prostitutes operating at various hotels and charged businessmen with monthly roof tax.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal proceeds and court rulings that have come into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court rulings, eight defendants separated from the so-called Dikayev Criminal Community criminal case, who had their criminal proceeds of EUR 80,000, or the judgment of nine individuals in 2006 for Igor Aleynikov to set up a criminal association aimed at the illegal trade of cigarettes and committing crimes related to human trafficking in East Virginia and in southern Estonia.
Confiled criminal revenue there is around EUR 71,500.
Success in these criminal matters has been ensured by police officers exchanging information and prosecutors exchanging information with foreign colleagues every day and carrying out actions together in any country of the European Union if necessary.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "A NAACP travel note issued for the state of Midsor, which is valid until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-Americans, visitors and Missouriers to be particularly vigilant and extremely careful when moving around the state, taking into account the entire suspicious racially-based event that has recently occurred across the state."
The NAACP said the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning both in a recent Missouri law making it harder to win cases of discrimination and the fact that the state's law enforcement officers target for an unequally large number of minorities.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are pulled to the side of the road because of the color of their skin, they are beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP's Missouri branch, told The Kansas City Star.
'We've never had so much grievance before.'
It is the first such warning the organization has issued about the U.S. state.
The group cited events such as racist insults at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black student from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of petrol while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the comment points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that cars of black motorists in the state are 75% more likely than white people to stop.
"It's designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state," he said.
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, Missouri documented 100 hate crimes in 2015, putting the state in 16th place in the state's list of similar violations.
The travel warning is also in response to a new law in Missouri that makes it difficult for the company to sue for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws requiring local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACLU said it would increase racial profiling.
Typically, travel warnings are issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have started using the measure as a counter-reaction to certain intra-U.S. laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what would anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different types of, A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses trigger acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C have a poor cost, which can develop into the liver cirrhosis, or liver wrinkles and liver cancer.
Moomo Kutsar, an epidemiology adviser to the NHS, says acute hepatitis disease is the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, appetite, nasty, vomiting, stomach pain, glowing urine, muscular and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucus.
The popular name collie disease of liver inflammation also comes from the latest disease.
In children, hepatitis can go without disease.
Different types of inflammation can only be identified based on data from the laboratory study.
Extreme hepatitis can switch to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without signs of disease, meaning a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-related disease.
Listo Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their progress more closely.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the stool of an infected person to their hands and hands to their arms, surfaces, objects, mouths and drug use.
Family members and carers of the disease, who are at risk of hepatitis infection, people with chronic liver disease, people who have sex with infected people, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with hepatitis A high spread.
Infringing can be prevented by vaccination, in particular for people travelling at high risk of vaccination and at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, day-to-day hygiene requirements are important: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before using them for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-a-mortaltex, using blood-soaked creatures (toothbrushes, squatting tools), donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis person, and having hepatitis from mother to foeve/born.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injection drug addicts, sextives of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care workers and other bodily liquids exposed to blood and other bodily liquids, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B.
People can be vaccinated to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, people at risk, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes, are recommended.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure, other sharpeners and syringes, tattooing and hole-in-walking, and the use of condoms in the event of conflict-prone sex or avoiding sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is free for children in Estonia as part of the national immunisation scheme and for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread when exposed to the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, hole-in-closing, using blood-soaked creatures, donor blood, having sex with hepatitis-protecting a person, and from hepatitis-daughter to the foetus/born from the mother to the foetus/born.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injection drug users, infected person sex partners, men having sex with men, infected mother's newborns, sick family members and caregivers, health, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily liquids, HIV infections and travelers visiting countries with hepatitis C.
The preventive measure of hepatitis C is: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicured equipment, other sharpeners and systolic nerves, tattooing and holeing, and using a condom for condom-threatention-threatening sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs in combination with hepatitis B or a super-infection in chronic hepatitis patients.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread through contact with blood and other bodily liquids, with contaminated needles, sexually transmitted and rarely infected mother to the foetus.
Hepatitis D is a risk group for chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people with non-viral immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis viruses spread through drinking water and food, including eating low-heated beef, fish and sea cucops, donor blood, commonly used syringes and infected mother to foeves.
Passengers can become infected in countries with hepatitis E high disease.
Hepatitis prevention measures include meeting hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the patient.
Fruit and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid eating low-heated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
While rivals tried to sprint off the four-time Olympic champion in the final round, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and the children along the way with him after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a fifth title race in a row in London with a golden duo of 5,000 and 10,000 metres.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Dam in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait," delves much deeper into the origin story of one artwork from the birth story of the late 19th and early 20th centuries of Vienna.
But even more in history.
The gut-wrenching amount of information might have been worn out, a thinnest of the cut; a narrower subject would have allowed the portrait allowed in the title to become more of an influence.
At the moment, there would be two books on the same cover: the story of Gustav Klimt and his painter "Daam in Gold," Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a far larger and more comprehensive history record of the esteemed Jewish family and the German occupation, along with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book takes the cultural life of Vienna in the midst of a bustling Vienna, and whoever has themselves entered the Austrian capital can imagine how life went around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone turned their heads in the Central Cafe when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see the name you know in the book, you feel like you're more cultured.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city where he was cursing syphilis and was Europe's highest suicide rate does nothing more to the story's progress.
Or perhaps, however, each pair of brushstrokes adds colour to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
The dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, nearly one in ten residents of Vienna was a Jew.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married twice to open a Czech sugar magnate, Ferdinand Bloch, and Klimt was posing for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh-largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet didn't pull the whole glamorous life to which she belonged.
If you look at "Damid in gold," it's hard to believe that, towards the end of his life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to commission a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the last minute was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt's order cost 4,000 kronor at the time, a quarter of the price of a well-placed country house.
The fact that some of the portraits were suspected of a love affair with the model didn't deter the sugar magnate.
As for Adele, the only sure fact is that the relationship between the model and the artist that emerged during the work continued until the end of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Daam in gold.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait, Varrak 2016, translated from English, Aldo Randland.
Shortly before the work began with Adele, Klimt had visited Ravenna in a basilica in San Vita, and investigators believe it was the brilliant mosaic seen there from Emperor Theodora that gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a mosaic of the coloured mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Damid Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and around the same time (from 1907 to 1908), another golden land was born in "Suicide."
Art historians didn't go unnoticed by the similarity between the two women.
How about Hitler?
"I think, to the memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his hands available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918), and asked their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before her death, Klimt had produced another portrait of Adele.
Also in her testament (Adele left in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave his two portraits and four of Gustav Klimt's landscape paintings for the Austrian Gallery.
She handed her jewellery to her sisters Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated from the "Austrian Mona Lisa," 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to enter the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but failed a drawing.
Although Hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be because he was not accepted into the academy by Jewish professors, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the Austrian Gallery of Australia, referred to in Maria's testament, had changed considerably by 1939 - finding works appealing to the Nazi party had become important.
Some of the work at Adele's home, but not Klimt's, was also suitable for Hitler's personal art treasure.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a decade of legal litigation between the Austrian government and the heirs of Bloch-Buers began.
It just mentions that if "Sucist" is seen at Belvedere Castle in Vienna, "Day in Gold," Adele Bloch-Bauer's depicting Adele Bloch-Bauerd, will have to go to the Neue Gallery in New York.
And before the trip to Vienna, read the above book.
Even if you don't plan to look at Klimt's work, because at least my emotions revolved around more Nazi and Jewish after the book was closed than the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer sold for 135 million dollars.
So not so much a portrait, rather than a family's fate - and a very moving story.
It was notable to navigate events in the Bauer family tree, listed at the beginning of the book.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the record in Canada
Gold was very close to her 200m backstroke personal record swimming in 2.16.62.
The peak dates back to the 17-year-old's squad a week ago, when the Canadian junior championships hit 2.16.58, the Priit Aviva Swimming Blog reports.
Gold reached the last A-League final.
He went the distance in the final with a time of 2.15.76 and finished in a good seventh place with another powerful top-flight finish.
A just over half-second from the record held by Alina Kendziori (2.15.13) was separated by Gold.
Gold climbed to third in the all-time rankings and its latest personal best is the fifth highest ever score.
The young hopeful is still in the 100m, 200m and 400m at the Canadian Adult Championships, and in the 200m and 400m.
Last week, Toronto held the Canadian Junior Championships and Gold made a successful start there, too.
She won a silver medal in the 200m freestyle with a time of 2.03.22.
So quickly, this distance was last swimming by the defending champion in 2008.
Only Estonian record-holder Elina Partõka has swimming this distance in Estonia.
The Canadian-born champion still won bronze in the 100m freestyle with an excellent personal record and a new season-high finish of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than him, has swaob that distance only one century faster.
He reached the personal top tier when he recorded a time of 1.03.69 in the opening swath of the 100m.
He finished only seventh in the half as he swam in the final at 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the rankings at four different distances for the national season.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics grit their teeth
The time for holidays is here - it also means relaxation for US President Donald Trump.
But since Trump has been one of the most vacation days so far, critics are already grinding their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president is scheduled to spend a 17-day vacation at his own golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's holiday began yesterday, Trump's opponents have been speaking out for a week on the holiday.
They reproach Trump for being too frequent.
Indeed, it is customary for the president to spend weekends in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villains.
Incidentally, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days in office.
George W. Bush, for example, had been on vacation for 67 days in that time, while Barack Obama was half as much as Trump, only 21 days.
But things tend to be quickly forgotten by Trump.
The days after becoming president, Trump said on "60 Minutes" that there would be no time for long vacations during his time in office because there was a lot of work to be done.
He also expressed outrage at Barack Obama's holiday three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: "While Obama is on holiday, playing golf, attending parties and jungle concerts, ISIS is cutting heads for journalists."
According to White House officials, the 17-day visit to the golf club is not a relaxation.
Instead, it is officially called a working holiday, during which Trump doesn't have time for reading or other distracting activities.
There was also another reason for the working holiday.
Specifically, the conditioning system on the western wing of the White House is being replaced, so all staff had to leave.
The Oval office and other presidential workspaces are also in the West Wing.
"I don't think any of you want to be in the West Squad in August if it's 38 degrees and no air conditioning," said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokesman who emphasized that the president would continue to work while on vacation.
Where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you get a glimpse of the video.
Blocking critics on Facebook - Don't run for public office if you don't tolerate voter criticism
Our father knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start tying him up for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The critif, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't make his critics silence.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of speech can be taken away from us and, in darkness and silence, we can be led to carnage like sheep."
That brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work harder to be more like Washington.
Hogani's subordinates have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union of America (American Civil Liberties Union) sued him for so.
The governor's administration tweeted the lawsuit as trivial, and online commentary was rifled with counter-reactions like "Who cares?"
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But that counts.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
This is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
His approval rate ranks second among the state's 50 governor.
Hogan is not a mind-boggling mood head.
He has led the state firmly and has remained strictly on his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook rather flashyly as a key tool for communicating with his constituents, for example, posing with his chin for the first time after chemotherapy.
So the governor's page - which is a public forum with official label, managed by staff hired by taxpayer dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people visiting.
Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, saying the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's all too easy to paint a picture of online trolls, junk-posters or people full of anger.
The Post spoke to several pretty people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that's what they're real people who interact with their elected leaders, the teacher, the owner and the pastor, not the internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not at all rough.
Pastor quoted the Bible in his post, insisting Hogan's Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Raman, a lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, did not instigated the anger, but about hate crimes.
"I politely said that I was disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news reports," he wrote in a commentary on The Post's news story.
'I don't like the idea of having a lot of people commenting on the same subject, some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort, rather than admitting that they are a lot of worried citizens.'
What the governor's official administration called a "direct spam attack" would probably be called "public support" by others.
The Facebook era allows messages to be easily matched by simply blocking a critic or deleting negative commentary.
It's a lot cleaner than it used to be when workers had to be expelled to collect newspapers with critical headlines and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's happening now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for being toothless on Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark court rulings on the subject was in Virginia last week.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment to the Constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington, Washington, affordable mail costs had a similar effect than the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1,800, the number of newspapers quadrupled and anonymous punditors scolded his way of running.
And even then, Washington had to bend with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington's decisions.
According to the historical documents composed as part of a project of online George Washington's collection of letters, his Cabinet was buried under petitions criticising his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't force them to remain silent.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the bedrock of our country.
And proper leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home territory at Renaissance Club
Former European frontman Ronan Rafferty is hoping for the comfort of his home territory over the next three days as the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the golf course at East Lothian's Renaissance Club.
The Northern Irishman, who was in charge of the next round at the Archerfield Links track last year before signing for Paul Eales, has been fond of the new venue and will play the role of tournament ambassador in place of Jerry Sarvadi, the club's founder and chief executive Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built and now we see the club shining in full swaths of this event," Rafferty said.
'The players see the track in their best shape, it's in a brilliant position.
Jerry has done an excellent job of building this place.
He's a keen supporter of the game of golf and he's proud of what he's achieved here.
It makes it possible to present the track perfectly."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to being able to defend the championship for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling," said the Southport-backed player.
'I couldn't defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off the competition calendar a year after my win.
It's magical to come back to that.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember memories of the last year, for me and my wife, Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always bear in our hearts.'
Gary Orr, who joined the European Tour of the Tour earlier this year when he was 50, will also return to the competition on home soil.
It will be his first event in Scotland since taking part in the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"It's always a little bit more meaningful to play," said Orr, a Helensburgh man.
'You want to perform well, but at the same time you're feeling extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and shown a pretty decent golf game.
I'm happy with the way things have gone so far.'
The trio will be joined in the squad by former Masters Tour winner Ian Woosnam and serpion Tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the competition, the other being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry is free, and parking for a car with one passenger costs 5 pounds and 10 pounds for a car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds will go to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold-plated land
When Bardina Degei prepares dinner, she doesn't use pencil.
He rarely even uses pot.
In a wooden house in Enarotal, the capital of the Indonesian province of Paniai, a domestic woman, calls a bat in the local language, is placed directly on a fire station in a wooden house in Enarotal, the capital of the Indonesian province of Paniai.
After half an hour, the charred mug is taken from the light and eagerly stacked with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - he doesn't have furniture - and he does his daily household chops, such as washing with blurred water from a nearby swamp.
The role of toitor is filled by a bump in a roofless room.
As she is the youngest of her husband's four women, she is not destined to take care of any field.
Polygamy is common here.
But working late can be dangerous - most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, plus there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to go around the village after 5 o'clock at night," he says.
It's a rare glimpse of life in Papua's mountainous country, a former Dutch colony that was merged with Indonesia in 1969 after a controversy that forced just 1026 elderly people to vote in front of the Occupy.
The move, which has fuelled the Dutch's domination, quickly turned its rage against the Jakarta government, which is still keeping the region under its strong control, deterring foreign journalists and human rights watchers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Pakistan, so the eastern part of the island remained in independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is equally remote and deserted, and you have to fly 90 minutes from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to Nabire and then go on a five-hour journey nauseous in a rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 has a population of about 19,000 consists of treehouses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by wavy iron roofs whose rust has turned different shades of yellow.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, not to mention journalists, and there have been almost no foreigners here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Mee Pago worshipped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, referring to his colourful hand-drawn turban, dark blouse and bright skirt.
'Before that, we only wore plant leaves on the body.'
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are one of Asia's worst.
But it is also Indonesia's gold-plated land.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of about New Jersey with a population of 153,000, Grasberg, the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can boast consumer wood stocks worth an estimated USD 78 billion.
But these riches are a source of suffering from the paddocks, as they lead to a stifling presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study in The New York Times found that Freeport paid about USD 20 million to local military personnel and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150,000 for a single officer.
Papuans' efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden path and are ruthlessly relentlessly relentless.
Human rights activists say more than 500,000 tankers have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing of Papuan tribals in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the area.
The Brisbane Archbishop's 2016 report "We will lose everything" contains testimonies of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (one other report says rape and electrical blows are particularly common) and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because these incidents happen weekly," says Andrew Harsono, an Indonesian investigator at Human Rights Watch.
Cruises have been turned up even harder as Papuans have caused an influx of newcomers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the province's population of 3.5 million are Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the crowded islands of Java, Calimon, Sumatra and Sulawesis in Indonesia.
Javachi family meals sell gado-gado with crisp chicken and mixed vegetables, served with peanuts.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migists started selling chicken and vegetables cheaper than local bakers in the traditional market," explains Paniais-born 24-year-old Abeth You, who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"Indigenous tanks - babe mama-mama'd-women - are therefore losing their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known to the public as Jokowi, pledged to address their inequalities and human rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former hippo won 27 of Papua's 29 constituencies on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace, including Pania.
But very little has changed in Papua and locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes of restoring justice," says You.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office, Paniai was struggling in a slump.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs in Enarotal when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorbike in the darkness.
The children who met told them they should turn the front lights on.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers scolded their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and eyewitnesses said the drunken militants chased the children and beat them with their gun handles.
One of the soldiers then shot the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeiko, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby Electoral Commission building was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of a local police station and military command centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting boars and performed a Papua honey pago tribal dance, during which they drove around and matted bird songs.
Some protesters began throwing rocks at police and military personnel.
"When the crowd resisted more than three times, they were shot," an official document said, according to an official document seen by TIME magazine but not issued to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, a senior in the district of Kego Koto, Enarotal, felt threatened and called for calm to keep calm, asking the crowd to go home.
No one didn't want to listen.
"I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the veranda of his brightly coloured treehouse.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from a series of gathered soldiers.
"There was a lot of shots, there was a lot of shots," he adds.
A local man, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to a cousin who witnessed his shooting.
"I would approach him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who uses only one name like many Indonesians, told TIME.
'I saw that he's dead... I kissed him.'
Papuan police Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only ensured the safety of his station because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if we are threatened with being killed," said Detective Superintendent Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papua police, in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and there were many injured.
News of the killings only arrived in Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura in which he offered his condolences to the families of the victims and pledged to address the abuse in Papua.
"I want to resolve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism to tackle crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately, apologies followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago," he said.
Some of these took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
"It's that we're committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes," he said.
But speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying he had no intention of setting up a mechanism to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "everything will be resolved according to the law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said 11 crimes against human rights had already been solved in Papua, including what happened in Pania.
The families of the victims of Paniai accepted such claims with grim distrust.
"I've been interrogated four times in the last three years, but there's been no progress," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
'I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'm being shot.'
His brother, Yacobus, said the people of Pania were afraid to displainise the incident.
He said he was beaten by the army after helping to bury the four victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shootings have not ceased.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the Pania neighborhood of Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when he went to a fight between villagers and the head of a construction company who refused to carry the unconscious man to hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Virginia villagers protested in front of the company's office at the construction site.
Police said villagers threw stones at police officers, after which they responded with warning shots.
But locals said the mobile brigade (Indonesia's military police) started shooting at the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a lot of panic, we were afraid of revenge," Dominggu Badii, a 29-year-old Dominggu, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured in the inclination, told TIME magazine.
'I've been hiding in my house for two days.'
Deiyai's parliament has called for the police officers involved to be held accountable and the police mobile brigade from the area being taken back.
Pania has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development feeds the discontent of the honey, moni, dani and Damadal tribes living in the Elm Mountain of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL), an army of insurgents that they say defends the rights of the tankers by carrying out casual attacks and kidnapping raids among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL's promoters are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of "protting the sovereignty of the country," the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in recent years under the pretext of "protection of the country's sovereignty."
Some of them will never show up again.
Among Papuans, Pania is known as a "tragic forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
The small amount of rice that is being sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
The bread is equally elusive.
People grow all their food themselves - mainly bacon, plus a bit of fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five bats.
They usually keep most of the catch to the family; the rest are sold in the local market.
Ten bats cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have worsened between indigenous paddocers and new migrants, who have seen large numbers since the new routes opened at Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist will go better for educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua itself often lacks the capital or necessary skills to do competitive business.
"Young people aren't interested in staying because there's no job or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Pania Boys Council.
Separateness keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, there will be severe restrictions on foreign media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua because "they did not follow appropriate practices" despite having been granted a rare filming licence.
Phelim Kine, deputy head of Human Rights Watch's Asia department, said Jokowi's election promises had not been implemented to lift restrictions on reporters to promote transparency and development.
"Indonesia from Papua's most turbulent provinces and journalists trying to report from the western Past Pastor face new threats - the rejection of the visa and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a media scrale is that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "multiple large-scale crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Pania.
These same countries have historically supported the VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations, telling reporters in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has democratic order and freedom of the press, so it is difficult to bury evidence of anti-human rights cases."
Locals want more foreign governments to take notice.
When the official delegation of the Netherlands, led by the country's human rights envoy, Kees Van Baar, visited Jaybira on 4 May, local people interrupted their silence, according to a source who was present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous, urging: "We want freedom."
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the tanks don't think they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Pania," says Hobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants to let Jokowi be told that, in addition to the fact that the people of Pania are constantly living under the threat of a predator army, they are suffering from misery because of nimble education and health services.
Gobai said the people of Pania, like other bakers, see their vote for Jokowi as a debt he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite the hyrums and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shootings were able to deal with the latest symbolic resentment - they buried the bodies of one of the victims on land opposite the police station and military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on its feet, at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a lower head.
"What else can we do?" he said.
Fire swallowed Dubai Torch skyscraper for second time
The fire flew through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee that 337-metre-high and 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that has ravaged a high-rise building in just two years, called it the Torchi, or True Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no immediate cause of the fire was reported.
'We slept and woke up to the fire and shouting people.
"We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," one resident, who called himself George, told Reuters.
Civil defense officials in Dubai said firefighters extinguished the flames at about 4 a.m. local time (0000 GMT GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outdoor area of high buildings around the world.
An investigation into the Turchi board's 2015 fire found the most damage was the facade - decorative panels and insulation of the exterior.
British police have said they believe the insulation and facade panels at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June, which killed around 80 people.
Watch: these phones are likely to become sales giants in autumn
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, as phone manufacturers reveal their new top models.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia Xi XZ Premium went on sale in the spring, with new hit-and-run phones expected in the fall.
Tele2 marketing and sales director Kristjan Seema said this year's flagships feature innovative design, eye-watering scarlet scarf, edge-to-edge 4K resolution screen and ultra-fast processor.
There was a lot of excitement in the tech world of the Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the top of the sales chart for smartphones.
Autumn promises smart enthusiasts even lighter fast charging, a more durable battery, a better quality camera and more water and dust resistance.
He added that the rumours could already make assumptions and predict the top four models, which are expected to hit this year's sales charts.
The four top smartphone models will arrive at stores later this autumn.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to hit stores as early as mid-September.
There are a lot of rumours about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it.
While the iPhone 7 didn't bring significant differences alongside the iPhone 6s, Apple's 10th birthday is expected to differentiate completely from the previous ones.
There are four colours: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is apparently the screen, which covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple design manager JonyIve insists the new iPhone model looks like a smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to eye-popping scans, cord-free charging and an even higher-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
It's certainly one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Preliminary orders for the new model, the Galaxy Note 8, will begin on August 23.
There have been a lot of rumours about what the new Galaxy Note 8 is going to look like.
There is reportedly more business users, and the S Pen will allow even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle and the other a TV object with a narrower view.
No one knows yet what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case this is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable to the iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
But we look forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has put three smartphones on sale this year, the Nokia 6 is still missing, their flagship - Nokia 8, which will be on display on August 16.
We expect a 5.3-inch screen from Nokia to the edge and ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of aluminum Corps and a significant level of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, the new model of Nokia has two rear cameras, the optics of which are manufactured by Zeiss.
While Sony's solid flagship has been XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future, with even more innovative features.
We expect a smartphone that is a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least as good or better with a camera.
There has been speculation about Sony's new model that its screen is at least six inchs.
What reality will bring, we will be seeing very soon, as Sony has traditionally unveiled its autumn flagship at the international technology fair IFA, which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year.
Trump pressed Mexico to pay for border wall, according to trans scripts leaked phone calls
The Washington Post has released transcribing of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump was on a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicity that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president lashed out at him for public condemnation of the wall, saying, "You can't tell the press."
Trump has made his presidential campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore Mexico to pay for the project.
Transcam footshthony of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has also revealed the intense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal for the United States to take on refugees heading to Australia was "naive", "sucribable" and "rump"; he argued that the deal, which was made under the Obama administration, would give him the impression of a "judgment" as he has proposed a ban on relocating refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the speech by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not hear the case against the MRP City Lines in which the city of Tartu rejected their bid for bus service from July 2019 until 2029.
It is an order rejecting the tender for MRP City of Lines in Tartu because the tender did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Ahtin, head of the city council's legal service.
This is the procurement of an internal public bus transport in the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP City Lines appealed to the Supreme Court's ruling in the NSW District Court.
The Supreme Court did not take a case.
While on social media many complain that the noise from the Weekend Festival is disrupting their nightfall and the entire city is full of intoxicated partygoers, there are many who don't have a single bad word to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the partygoers were so polite in the store!
I didn't see any blurredness or rudeness.
Even I saw the kindness," says Laine.
"It's great to come, be there and it's a joy to be had, that's like winter solstice left in winter," he adds with cheer.
The sneaking out of the beach doesn't bother Laine's sleep.
While living in the city centre, he still heard that music was being played on the beach, music has not yet reached his home.
"But I hope I hear," he says cheerfully.
Speaking to The Associated Press, Agnes says the big festival is more of a good thing for Perth - it contributes greatly to local merchants.
He also rejoices that so many ex-scencemen have come to visit the summer capital.
The bellicles of the men don't bother the woman.
Although I don't sunbathe on the beach anymore, it's great that the beach has been lively.
And it's great that people are moving and it's been three times already," he says.
The first time I think it was a little bit worse.
"There might have been complaints," he reflects.
But the melee on the beach is common for summer superstorians, he said.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," says Harris, who is hiding in the park.
Melble and mobster haven't hit his life's rhythm either.
But what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interethnic communication would be better.
The music doesn't molest the man.
It doesn't bother, even though I live nearby.
"Good people can save and there's no mischief," he says.
The guests who come to Perth are polite, he said.
"They've obviously exaggerated a little bit, but young people are young and lord god - give it a go, but be human and we can do it!" he says.
By then, coastal residents would have travelled somewhere, either to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this kind of meal," says Tina, who has walked with children in Pärnu.
Her family's sleep isn't bothered by festival music either, though last year it went even further than this year.
Last summer the stage was the other way round, then we heard more.
"We live out of town that it's actually going pretty well to the far stretch of the Pearl River," he says.
Pearson cuts 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education company Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent, triggering another restructuring programme to tackle the business's looming predicament.
The lost jobs, which will be made redundant, will most likely be made in late 2018 and early 2019, will be added to the 4,000 posts lost in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced plans in May to cut costs by a further 300 million pounds (394 million U.S. dollars) as part of a third cost-cutting program to try to revive a business that has been hit by a rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in the company Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann last month, said its expectation for the year had not changed since it reported a 1 percent increase in sales revenue to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.

The temperature is 13-17 degrees.
There will be intermittent cloudy weather during the day.
Several inch of rain fall, with thunderstorms possible.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
The suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
The NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
Unconfirmed local reports said three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest in a series of acts of violence that has hit Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in a Mosque attack in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement said Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with "a self-propelled explosive device" carried by a human.
The statement said all were injured in stable condition and were being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say the growing power of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), are a serious source of concern for the forces in Qarabo, NATO's Baghdad.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which around 20% in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in the mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bomb attack killed more than 150 people in the city - the most deadly military attack in the country since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
This violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of US troops assisting the country's military and police.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA revokes decision to delay smove order after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (United States Environmental Protection Agency), the EPA, reversed the decision to delay an Obama-era regulation requiring states to limit smog-causing exhaust emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced the decision to continue the "2015 ozone-denox" late Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with the states.
"We believe we need to engage in dialogue with our state partners and listen to them," EPA leader Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to push ozone-densing rates - which would measure smotting pollution in different parts of the country to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to October 2018.
Fifteen mostly Democratic states filed a lawsuit Tuesday with the District of Columbia, saying the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been trying to pull back a series of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, and Trump said it is part of a broader plan to boost growth.
But those efforts have sparked resent among Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the increased impact on human health.
The EPA's website says inhaling ozone-containing air "may reduce the ability of the lungs and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases" such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and cattle could have a feast as heavy rain threatens the catch of the European Union's second-largest wheat producer, Bloomberg writes.
This year, weeks of rainfall before harvesting could mean that the fruit, intended as a bread industry, tends to feed only animals.
"The quality is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
Up to 40 per cent of German wheat could go for animal feed this year, double what is normal, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all weather this year.
First, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by a heatwave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by rainfall, which has continued in August.
Many eyes are turned to northern Germany, where rain is preventing harvesting.
So far, only 5 per cent of wheat has been harvested.
The harvest has not yet started in most of the area, said Ceravis, a local harvest buyer.
"It's a pretty difficult day," said Frank Deckert of Rendsburg, a senior trader at Ceravis.
In everything, the clever wedge of Finn's interior design
Beautiful nature plays a part in the interiors of the fair's homes, as the magnificent views of the Saimaa shores reach many (living) rooms through large windows.
At every turn, our northern neighbours' quest to create both rough and perfect (energy-saving) homes stand out.
The ability to use Finns as construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty items are worthy of attraction, as well as respect for Finn's wood.
Virtual techniques and smart solutions can be found in the fairhouses as both the builder and the (home) designer.
It turns out that black, white and grey shadow combinations, if they are complemented by wooden tones and tomatoes, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked for another week, as the fair runs until August 13.
The cupboards and herb pots suggest that this kitchen often cooks.
On the night of the night, the line was drawn for this year's Weekend Festival, and Martin Garrix did his best to remember the latter as a performer.
The crowd was truly spinner during Garrix's performance - singing, hunching, dancing self-deprecatingly.
When the Garrix stopped, the masses spread from Pärnu beach to the city.
We'll bring you a gale that has all the images our photographer captured over three days at Weekend.
You're definitely some of them, look up!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to be on the collision course to face up to 66.7kg in the weight category in the most attractive boxing match of the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN's office in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked to the other end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization bronze medal champion.
After Garcia's unanimous decision in a victory over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner at Showtime on Saturday, both fighters are in the top of the weightlifting table.
Garcia shook his right hand and said, "How are you going, champion?
I wish you luck.'
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday night.
As the pair posed for the photos, Lomachenko's pimp, Egis Klimas, said a possible confrontation between the fighters would be a "perfect measure."
"I'm a former bratweight," Garcia recalled.
'I went up to 63.5kg for Broner but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5kg.
I want to go down to lightweight.
And he has to move up the lightweight, 61.2kg, and then we can fight.
The fans have wanted it.
So let's give them that.'
Lomachenko agreed.
"The oxide world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether watching it should be worthwhile, which is part of his strategy for allowing Lomachenko to debut in the 61.2k grade later this year to make a possible meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30-0) for next summer, who also has an interest in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbell match after their lightweight title race on September 23.
"It could be worthwhile to watch this fight because the fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, later saying he was open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
'We're key players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "foreign fighter" and could go to see his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko was humbled to praise Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey ... you wanted that nocturnal."
Garcia said the goal was to show the hitter and then box.
Both said they felt the pressure to grow between them.
'It's a fight that's waiting to be realised.
No other confrontation generates as much attention and glening.
I'm more than willing to work for it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been on the bets and Mikey is just that.
It's going to be a good fight.'
Which corners of the world will move to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Protection Agency (PPA) extended and issued a record 13,000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly traveled to Estonia to work, study or family.
Last year, for example, it was decided to issue a fixed-term residence permit to 6,702 foreigners, the figure was 4,928 last year.
Officials cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared by the Ministry of the Interior.
While nearly 500 Ukrainians a year moved to Estonia 10 years ago, in recent years the number is starting to come close to 2000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased exponentially during the Ukraine crisis, with 1087 people getting fixed-term residence permits in 2014, up from 675 a year earlier.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the largest increase in the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia, with 850 more Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia last year than leaving.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and because of difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought in a country where the community and many families are already ahead," said Kristin Rammus, a spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry.
Last year and last year, the number of Ukrainians who received fixed-term residence permits was higher than the number of Russian citizens, although the most fixed-term residence permits for the most time-limited residences have been issued in a decade.
While Ukrainians come here to work, Russian citizens for family migration.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the largest family ties to people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the National Academy of Defense.
"If you look at where the Russian citizens who have granted Estonian residence permits have moved to live, then there is East Virginia right now after Harjumaa," he added, pointing out that about 40 percent of them have married to a European Union citizen.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received fixed-term residence permits, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to renew the residence permit decreased.
"There is a reason that a new residence permit has been applied for permanent residence permits to settle in Estonia instead of extending the residence permit," explained Rammus, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonian residence permits has remained stable for years.
For a permanent residence permit to settle in Estonia permanently, foreigners who have lived here for at least three years will be able to apply from last year.
It aims to encourage the people who have adapted to stay.
However, a long-term resident's residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has also probably been reduced because of the new residence permit.
Last year, for example, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Now Ukrainians can change jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be able to tip whether the salary criterion has been met.
This residence permit became popular - last year other grey passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36) were also applicants.
In total, 1968 people, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese, received a residence permit to settle in Estonia.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In a decade, surprisingly, Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residency permits.
While three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, 200 last year.
Nigeria comes to university here to study.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular with Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen, largely due to the study migration.
"The rule applies to where the community has come up in advance, there will be easier access to others," Rammus added.
In 10 years, two people have also moved to Estonia from North Korea, the same number from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
While around 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit each year, that is about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if the citizens of the European Union are included, migration will remain at about a percentage point," Maasing said, "in fact, the figures are small.
In total, 14,861 people migrated to Estonia last year, compared with 13,792.
This means that immigration has surpassed the second year of emigration.
Most of those who come out and in are Estonian citizens, but more are among those who leave.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was minus 2,000 last year.
Estonians migrate, first and foremost, between Finland and Estonia.
Princess of Mammu Couture charms with satin, sneaters and sneaks

If you do something with passion, you study and learn more about it every day.
It's a joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem like a lifebs of life for some, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much brilliance is in your life!
I have a girlfriend who has a whole sauna full of haute couture dresses I created.
Because it's not her fault that she doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go on the red carpet every day, she wants to wear these most beautiful dresses and wears it!
You can live your life special!
The fashion designer doesn't acknowledge the gulf between shiny events and the grey day.
It was this reasoning that has rolled out a plan to move high fashion to rural areas in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people who are often not reached by fashion.
The Mammu collection was presented at the fashion show in Canberra, Riverside and Pearl, where the royal defies with 45 models filled the entire street.
It's often pooged, nodded with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - crying bravado, standing up, wanting to thank you for your hands.
A lot of the audience came to see it, but now they're fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people's expectations, they're excited.
And I like the feeling that I'm like on a summer tour with my fashion.
We had a 50-metre-long red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, it looked like they weren't coming to an end!
Maria also doesn't admit to the fashionable faction that the creation must be presented by a supermodel; she is happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they've always been happy to come.
It's such a betting experience, you can shine on stage in a wonderful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my own show, I'm always on stage to give things one last slide as a hopeless perfectionist.
My face wouldn't allow me to look calmly in the room.
Maria is this kind of fashion designer who doesn't just want to play a representative role, but to be in everything.
I have my own seamstress in the studio, most of the collection I do.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I'm never far away from my creations and I'm not afraid of work.
It's not about design, it's not about stylistics, logistics, organisation, organizing - everything has to fit into one temperamental woman's day.
There will still be a huge amount of working hours for fanatics.
I can't tell when my working day will end, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an unforgoted chain of happiness: I'm doing something beautiful, people get something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
Several times it's said that my dresses have magic - they make you feel like a princess.
The absilable scoop, which made Maria's talents famous overnight, has remained a signing for Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin Wallace of U18 boys: The gun of the tournament now turned against us
It's a shame, the fairytale ran out.
The first thing to see was that we didn't get our shot.
And when there's such a big difference in the table, there's nothing you can do," said Martin Sellers, our only basketball player who played in the NBA, BC Calev/Cramo's assistant coach, for the U18 basketball team.
Opponents took 28 balls from the offensive board and got so many more attacks because of it.
We weren't prepared for their aggressive defensive or attack either, it created.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build a defence.
Defensive defensive, however, they were able to keep their hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
It cut the crew's legs.
Their homework was better done.
According to the Wallabies, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes to take down the momentum of their opponents in the first place.
In the last quarter - we had zero errors, but our opponents have already got a number of quick baskets.
The athleticism and the intense innings that was our weapon in the underdog tournament have now all turned against us.
Today, we didn't have the strength against their aggression.
The Wallabies remained at peace with their caretaker, Matthias Tass.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about a whole team; to this day, there was a single hitch.
It's a shame you've met such an aggressive opponent before.
He's always been confident and played his own out today, but he looked tired - he's carried a pretty heavy burden.
But he made some really nice moves I've seen in the past," the mentor added.
Curious numbers: The Clippers scored fewer than 10 points in three quarters in the tournament. ...
It's not just the men's EM B-division basketball tournament in the U18 age bracket, the umpires started the day before in Dublin.
And Estonia's game against Poland unfortunately strapped into the anti-record area.
Estonia lost 25-65, but still had a 9:49 lead after the third quarter, only in the final 10 minutes they took their feet off the gas pedal and that period fell to 16:16.
Estonia scored 4 in the third quarter in both the first and second quarters. ...
The Dodge hit two pieces in the first four innings in two minutes, but 25 from the game, then one triple in and then another 21 shots past. ...
In perhaps almost half an hour, one of the 47 shots was caught.
There were also two points from four free throws.
There was a reasonable number of sources in that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had 33 per cent and Estonia 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia have started with two defeats, with Portugal's 83-56 defeat on the opening day.
NATO ships come to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO's 1st Standing Mine Combat Team arrived in Tallinn for a scheduled port visit over the weekend to replenish the ship's supplies and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships are preparing to return to the sea, giving crew members the opportunity for a few days' rest.
Following the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a series of exercises and to be ready for future historical explosives-proshade operations.
"The involvement of the Estonians in the NATO unit and the cooperation training they carry out in local waters is well illustrated by our integration with allied forces," said Captain Arto Reinmaa, commander of the Operations and Planning Division, which is commanding the Navy's fleet.
Since 29 June, the NATO 1 permanent mine control group will be led by Latvian Navy Lieutenant Gvido Laudups, who took over the roles of group commander from Captain Johan-Elias Seljamaa in a ceremony in Riga.
The group's flagship has been designated as the Latvian Navy support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, which also has the group's flagship.
This month, the Estonian navy mine hunter Sakala is also part of the international unit.
As one of the four groups of ships under NATO's maritime command, NATO's 1st permanent anti-mine group is a readiness unit among the first emergency responders, which the alliance can send to various locations around the world within five days.
Until 4 and 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become a site where the Birgitta Festival, which was run 13 years ago by maestro Eri Klass, will be held.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Risto Joost, the artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic.
Risto Joost: Listeners include "Traviata" and "Tosca," ballet performances from the fascinating "Bolero" to the fun "Karlsson" and the programme is not lacking in its production, which this time is Joseph Haydn's marvellous oratorial oratory "The Yeartimes," by the same international creative team,
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It's bigger than any musical theatre in its usual form.
It's a festival whose fascination takes hold and never quite lets loose again.
Because the experience that the listener gets in this surging and mysterious environment makes the human souls ring and touch human feelings in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't maestro Eri Klass' shoes look a bit big?
Of course, but because I had a very personal relationship with Eric, it has helped a lot.
He guided me through my entire student career and also supported me at the start of his acting career.
Maybe it's because of that it's easier for me to continue his work.
The special class has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it's all passed on to me.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things are going.
It was the great heart of Eri Klass that gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn.
And here I am and I can!
What might excite the audience at this year's festival, what a special one you'll offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania, and, surprisingly, the first ballet written for Astrid Lindgren's story will come to the presentation.
It's "Karlsson flies".
And one ominous nuance in this is that the author of this ballerina is the Latvian composer Yuris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write the work.
Apparently he has lived in Karlsson's cricketer since he was a child.
Risto, how do you share all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner for sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and thankfully I have that.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions don't depend so much on other people as about me myself, how do I go to every new day.
And that conscious tone, maintaining positivity and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the mornings greatly increased my happiness rate.
Especially this week, when the most important tests are, I've been practising it especially enthusiastically and it works.
Smiling at you activates the brain and lifts the tone.
It's not just a punchline.
I don't think people yet know half the things about their bodies that the universe offers them, but everyone is slowly discovering it.
Immediately, it's an important moment.
Do you have a ritual before you step into the editor's pulpit?
It's still, the clothes need to be replaced with more comfortable ones.
It's a small moment for yourself.
But generally yeah, I don't have a chance to rest or do a little skate before a big performance.
In fact, I even like to engage actively with people, even before I step down.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, here's what's discovered for a not-so-great friend of opera and ballet!
Watch the moody video with Risto Joost.
New results of Swedish asylum seeker age tests revealed
In Sweden, a test was carried out among asylum seekers, assessing their age with a novel approach medically, the latest results from the test show that more than 80 per cent of the teens were rated older than 18, but not all believe the results will be accurate.
Sweden's National Institute of forensic medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began the tests earlier this year.
The experiments were set up to assess their age more accurately during their asylum application after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly underage refugees.
So far, 2,880 cases have been sent to the trial, and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2481 tests between mid-March and July 31.
Eighty percent (2002) were rated as 18 years old or older, and in 25 other cases, the Institute forensic medicine estimated that the test "may be 18 years old or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person was "presumably younger than 18."
Tests are only used if a person's age is in question.
Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, said the results were consistent compared to those in previous months.
"We don't see a big difference compared to the statistics in previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
Just because a large proportion of cases were rated older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The institute issued 581 tests in May and said that 442 cases "have indications that the person under investigation is 18 years old or older."
But when the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated the results of their 581 tests, it was found that in 243 cases the person had directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, which makes X-rays of wisdom teeth and knee joints of MRT, after which they are allowed to be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose tasks include assessing human biological maturity to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
'I've had reason to think about that and I don't think the method of measurement we are using at the moment should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't be pretending to get it," he told Metro.
But Johan Goransson, from the Institute of Forensic Medicine, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, the risk of an inaccurate parenting child is low.
The biggest risk, at about 10%, is if a person is just under 18.

Anna Maria Orel, a 20-year-old wrestler, made her beautiful debut at London Melbourne, finishing a fine 18th in 67.37.
Oregon was the youngest female widow in the MSM and a cheerful woman said she hoped to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I had a good experience.
"In the first Test (64.80), I immediately made my average score, in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," Ore said after the contest.
I was looking for my emissions and I'm very happy to have found it.
Anna Maria Orel's MS debut finished a good 18th.
The rain didn't bother Orel because he's training through the winter at the TCU Stadium.
"I'm hardened," he said with a little mug.
There was almost a full house in the London Olympic Stadium, did Oregon perceive people around him or could he turn himself off?
I felt, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it adds up - that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel said he would be satisfied with his NRL debut and still have a lot of good competitions ahead of him: "I came here with the 32nd result this season, finishing 18th.
It's a very decent result.
I'm 20 and in MS - that's the only thing that matters.
I'll have a good experience and some days I want to compete for medals.
West Virginia governor announces party change
Jim Justice, the Democratic governor of West Virginia, announced at a rally with President Trump on Thursday night that he would change the party.
"It wasn't or not, but the Democrats walked away from me," Governor Justice said.
'Today I will tell you, having prayed and thought a lot... today I say to you, the Westerners, that I can no longer help you as democratic governor.'
There were cheers at the gathering.
"That's why I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you that it's time to play another game," he said.
Trump had previously promised a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the state's only billionaire, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has a coal business from his father.
It is worth about USD 1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued an announcement Thursday night that "the Governor-Coury Party change is another blow to the Democratic Party that would rather prevent the country from getting better than working for it."
"The 15 governor's positions and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent off-season for a party that is out of the top and cannot find a positive and unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
It may not be a surprise that where there are a lot of people, there are many injured people.
Urmet, who is in the medical tent at Weekend, told The Associated Press yesterday that they have had to share the patches quite a lot.
Villas and mashing are basic, twisted and light falls.
Of course, head, back and leg pains.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes, and so the problems come.
Medics have also had to help visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and one leg fracture.
We have also done seams when a person has broken a hand or finger.
We'll do the smaller seams here, we're going to get the bigger ones to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if partygoers are asking medics for painkillers to treat the bombshell.
Coe praises Russians' "false apology" for doping scandal
Athletics international sniper Sebastian Coe praised what he said was "Russia's Thursday honest apology" over the doping scandal, but reiterated that this is not the time to allow the sport back to the country.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, a nicknamed Russian athletics, told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's ban was right and he had a strong aim to fight doping.
He apologised to "all athletes who have been nabbed for gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to keep the ban in place, which was imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian federation itself acknowledged that they had had quite difficult times and were doing everything possible to restructure the federation," he said.
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted its reinstatement criteria.
"I think today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the group's proposal that this is not the right time for Russia to withdraw," Coe said.
'We'll have to do everything we can over the next few months to normalise the situation.
"We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the broken system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the IAAF's strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the Athletics World Championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia was not yet meeting several criteria for reinstatement.
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that doping control was still inadequate and that the banned coaches were still acting freely.
The electric car revolution will significantly change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only is the electric car revolution fundamentally changing everything from fuel to infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metals market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say they will win from one place and lose out on the other, smaller mining companies will not help.
Glencore currently serves coal and oil, but in the future era of electric cars, cobalt, lithium, aluminium and clinic will increase.
This year, decisions by the UK, French and Norwegian governments of the United Kingdom, which will ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades have raised the stakes in terms of the spread of electric cars.
As a result, Volvo has already announced that they plan to scrap the internal combustion engine, and Tesla is putting a cheaper Model 3 electric car on the market.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more electric cars than cars using oil-produced fuels will be sold for two decades.
"In terms of some metals, it changes everything," Simona Gambranini, commodities analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithotal, which have been growing in demand for years.
Electric cars have about three times as much copper as a conventional car, Glencore said.
More copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that this will increase copper demand by about 5 per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore is coming off a growing trend of electric cars from copper prices and being the world's largest cobalt maker, Jefferies Group has forecast.
The brokerage firm estimates that the other winners of the electric car race include Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is responding to an already changing trend.
This year, cobalt has risen 70 per cent on the London Metal Exchange.
Last year's price increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also risen 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Shares in Glencore rose 20 per cent in London after surpassing rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the disappearing side are lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine, which need to adapt to a new era.
The main end use of the leaker is the batteries that supply the flow of petrol and diesel-powered cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"It's a serious risk to lead demand unless another purpose is found that could overcome a decline in demand," said Michael Widmer, head of metals market analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The impact of the trend is not yet noticeable in the form of a slittering price movement.
The slide has risen 17 per cent this year, the best metal among the major industrial metals in London.
Investors see problems for the metal only in the long term.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for lead because cheap oil keeps conventional cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at metals brokerage company Triland Metals.
If lead demand falls, it will happen slowly.
It could have happened in about 10 years.
In the meantime, stricter emissions standards mean that demand for hybrid cars, which depend on lead-based batteries that are developed when engines are launched, is assessed by the International Organisation for lead and zinc.
Light metals like aluminium replace steel as a lighter car can drive more with less electricity.
This explains the additional 1.6 million tonnes of minimum minimum demand for the period 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 per cent of global production of aluminium.
That trend is likely to intensify, Widmer said.
Aluminium has risen 13 per cent this year as growing demand from carmakers has led to a market deficit.
Steelers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce tiny car hulls.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to resist the lower minimum.
"Strong steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil era can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of that precious metal was taken as a catalyst for diesel cars, metal trailer Johnson Matthey said.
"A lot of raw materials like oil and platinum at the moment may not have much demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, a commodities analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that the raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe there is continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore chief executive Marc Grynberg said more hybrid cars would continue to be sold in 2025.
The high hope of platinum manufacturers in 10 years is for the hydrogen-based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which depend on platinum to generate electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, the technology has not yet justified itself commercially.
"Disees appears to have a clear loser on the road to electric cars," said Exane of BNP Paribas Brunet.
German carmakers suffered a major setback in July after a Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche's hometown.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules designed to prevent the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's world record move from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences for UEFA, the governing body that dominates the European game and which has the power to ban teams from participating in a prestigious Champions League tournament, awaits Paris Saint-Germain.
UEFA's Fair Play Financial Regulations (FFP), introduced in 2011, mean PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar's transfer was funded without huge losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) alone to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar's salary will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to the French club.
PSG will no doubt be able to come up with such money to recruit Neymar and add to their star-studded squad, given that the team is funded by the dominant family of Qatar's energy rivals.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of time recruiting players, but they have to balance it with the legal sources of income that will allow them to come up with their own in the football business.
The FFP was launched by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
This former French player believed clubs that fall into high debts in search of success would actually engage in cheating and risk ruining should banks or owners drop their support.
Since 2011, FFP has been focusing on monitoring their losses instead of the debts of clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then making big spending to improve the team and create a global brand - will be harder to implement.
During the FFP's current three-year assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can carry losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini being shamelessly ousted from the presidential run in 2015, his successor, Alex Ceferin, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The AFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," Andrea Traverso, who is a supervisor at UEFA for FFP, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid for Neymar's over-exemption clause as a single out-to-one payment, they will be able to split that amount into parts throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so it will be possible to show a transfer fee for the next five years as a total of 44.4 million euros.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG suffered the most severe penalties along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
PSG were fined 60 million euros (currently 82 million dollars), which were later reduced to 20 million euros, and the club were ordered to restrict the Champions League team to 21 players instead of the usual 25 in the 2014-15 season.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to over-schedule financial institutions by blowing up their earnings through companies linked to the club's owners.
The Qatar company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of sponsorship is deemed to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as official earnings.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority's PSG support had been inflated.
It has been said that some of Neymar's PSG service could come from Qatar through payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador for the World Cup and argue that UEFA's governing bodies could easily expose such maneuver.
The penalties handed down to PSG in the past mean UEFA will be even more vigilant in any attempt to flot the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed Neymar's move proactively with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that they are guaranteed anonymity because they are not allowed to discuss PSG's situation.
The most recent reports show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in the 2015-2016 season at a turnover of around 542.4 million euros.
Data for the past financial year has not yet been released.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to have a positive impact on sponsorship deals, trades and shirt sales.
The club expects turnover to rise at least 30 per cent when the contract is awarded.
The Spanish league, clearly upset about the departure of one of the biggest football stars, sought to prevent Neymar's move by claiming PSG were spoiling the FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with club and country," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG is mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's view that the country is funding the club.
"It's a consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
'If a club is owned by the state, anything is possible.
It's very difficult to respect fair game financial rules because the country can have other ways or other interests for such a great player to represent the country.'

50 years ago today: a storm of hurricane-sized in Estonia that tore roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane, dubbed the storm of the century, which sparked major damage on August 6 and 7, caused major damage, particularly in the West Country, Harris County and Raplamaa.
In the northwestern part of those days, wind speeds were above 30 mph.
My old man ran from one of the arcade trees to the other in the garden and covered up with his hands to support them.
Everything was dark and rattled, like the end of the world.
The roofs were already flying from houses, recalled Linda Kurova of Haapsalu in a 2002 interview with the Estonian Nature magazine.
Linda's wife saw the garden she planted collapse.
But what do you support the trees with your hands, where do you get up against this storm?
The sea came down the window, water sprayed from the windows," Ms Linda, who lived on the street in Kansas, told the time.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station had flowed 20-30 metres away was only seen by Linda as the next morning.
Locals said the trees behind Paralepa were on the ground, some completely tall, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through beautiful old trees with rug and cracking like a war.
West Virginia wasn't hit particularly hard in the August 1967 storm compared to western Estonia, but the damage there was also severe, the Virginia Journal reported in 2007.
The Los Angeles Park and Padis Park were swept away from the ground, but our parks were also severely affected.
In Tallinn, wind speeds were measured at speeds of up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
One tiny pencil squad had shouted, "Mother, Mother!
The chickens are in the air and can't sign anymore!" he wrote.
The sprawling estate building in Queensland was destroyed during the storm so much that it was later demolished.
Augustiam was not held up by the structures of the ski jump mountain in Turkey, which was later restored.
The Red Star newspaper wrote on August 12, 1967, that clearing cities and towns from fallen trees and their branches was progressing slowly, and residents could participate in the clean-up.
The crop has also been badly affected, and the newspaper reported that "party organisations must be inspirations and guides for both tidying up and crop harvesting."
Hurricanes can be talked about when average wind speeds exceed 32.7 mph.
The record for winds in Estonia has remained in the country from 2 November 1969, when wind speeds of 48 mph were measured on the Ruhn.
On the island of Vaindloo, the measuring tool was crumbled, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Mystery of clean beaches: night clean-up and poor beach weather
Cold summer weather also means a smaller harvest on the beaches of Tallinn.
"If there's the weather, people are on the beach, and if they don't, there's no people"," says the beach's cleaner.
There are kayarts on Stroom beach in the north London area.
They are faced with melodic competition from a tractor-trailer bred in low turns that ploughs off the patch.
In fact, the last one travels through the sand seven centimetres deep, picking out sea debris and the grass left behind by humans: bottle caps, cigarette butts and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
"When it's beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if they don't, there are no people," says Alexander Usov, head of cleaning operations at the Haabersti Administrative Coast.
It's 6.30pm and there's a bitter clean-up on the beach because the site has to be in order for people at 8am.
Usov is in the post from 4 p.m.
In addition to Stroom, he is also keeping an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Palmyra on Long Island Beach.
The amount of litter has decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them," says Usov, who has cleared the beaches for 15 years.
Before, when something new was put up, it was broken the next day.
Now what's on the beach is keeping.
Price of a clean beach
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is the clearing of sea debris, or adru, dumped on the shore.
For example, it must be hauled 400,000 tonnes away from the beach season.
"It's an incredible amount," Usov notes.
The second big category is municipal litter, or all that people leave behind.
The one-and-a-half-mile Stroom beach strip has eight large containers of rubbish that need to be emptied three times a week.
There is so much rubbish.
However, colder summer weather has meant that rubbish is a fifth less than it would otherwise be.
The third species is abandoned.
In most cases, they are children's life.
This year, Usov has ploughed a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They will be left waiting for the owners on the wooden road leading to the beach.
"Obviously more of them come out, but it's a normal catch," Usov already knows that soon he'll find them back in the sand.
Kids come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
The debris is scattered
Erika Scholler, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii Department of Management, concedes that tractor screening efforts are disrupting locals.
The noise, which lasts from the hours to early morning, disrupts the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
But on the day, this work is impossible.
In one month, the beach has to be sifted out twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler says.
But the aim, like Pirita, Long and Pearce, is to get Stroom beach under the international blue-chip quality label.
"Compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to have the beaches maintained," Scholler says.
We have more adrums and stones and harder to sieve in the sand.
However, there is less rubbish on our beaches than in the rest of Europe.
After hearing that rubbish is being talked about on the beach, Martin, who lives near Stroom Beach, is coerced into a conversation with a journalist and cleaning staff, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
There's a rough picture everywhere in the mornings.
The problem is the birds and bottle pickers who have pulled their bags around," Martin says.
While it's hard to expect people to be able to change their current behaviours, Martin hopes the city government will take action with dumpsters and, for example, put booze on them to prevent birds from going there.
Overall, however, Martin is happy with the development of Stroom Beach.
You can see the city taking care of that.
With children's squares, illuminated and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
"It used to be that the rollercoaster could only ride one way," Martin notes.
Tree hunt finds in Stroom: coins, coins, coins
A morning huddle has come to take advantage of 40-year-old Dimitri, who combs the beachfront with a metal detector as a treasure hunter.
He doesn't think he'll find anything precious today or in the future.
The seaside dolls are not generous enough to do so.
"I've been working on it for a year and I haven't found anything valuable so far," says Dmitry.
As a hobby hunter, Dmitry's treasure bag has some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous pounds that later throw in the bin.
Usually there are still coins.
"There's usually no cubs, rings and so on," says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to expect interest rates to remain at its current level as unswing growth and a surge in inflation have softened speculation of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as household stagnating incomes have put interest rates on hold.
Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6:2 to keep rates at 0.25%, and fewer members are calling for a rise this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its 1.6% year in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would remain as inflation is still expected to rise near 3% in the autumn.
However, the Bank also signalled that rate hikes will be necessary over the next few years to curb inflation caused by Brexit, and that higher than expected of borrowing costs may be needed in financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of a partial withdrawal of the mammoth package that was boosted by the economy launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
The bank will end its fixed-term financing scheme in February, which will offer low-cost funding to banks, although it said it was now expected to offer 15 billion pounds more than the scheme, which is 115 billion pounds.
In the minutes of the decision, the bank says: "In the mid-point forecast for gross domestic product (GDP), gross domestic product (GDP) will remain forceful in the near future, as the plight of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
The fix was repeated that "financial policy tightening some tightening" was needed to mitigate inflation, and "a bit more" than the markets are expected.
The stock is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any jumps were gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next are comparable to forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7% for the year in May.
The forecast for growth of 1.8 per cent in 2018 remained.
After that news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 U.S. dollars and 0.4% to 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is the result of recent disappointing growth figures dashed expectations of rising expectations of an increase in GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up some momentum at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little reason for the delight of households suffering from rising inflation and miserable pay rises, saying things are getting a little worse before the improvement.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent a hitting hitting income in the next few years, but a significant return on wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The weak pound is also being boosted by growing demand for British produce, partly to compensate for lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were moved to 0.25% last August following a shocking EU referendum that caused the pound to weaken suddenly.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years to breathe full life into prices and the economy.
Before the bank's latest decision, there was a growing demand for a rate rise as inflation had increased the pressure on strapped households; in July, three policymakers called for the rate to be raised to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, down from 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was on the up (UPI) and was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the over-incomplete increase was due to a fully weak pound compared to the 2 per cent target.
Andrew Montlake, head of mortgage brokers at Coreco, said: "Given the recent fall in rates, the mortgage market looks set to become increasingly competitive again as lenders crave work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock market looks particularly favourable to those whose existing transactions are coming to an end as refinancing, often without service and low rates, has become increasingly popular."
NHS has written off 10,000 people off controversial HIV drug
Patients have had access to "transformative" HIV-preventive treatment since September after a battle in the High Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England said the NHS would now make available to an estimated 10,000 people during the initial three-year clinical trial of pre-extincer prophylactic (PrEP), a tablet that is administered before intercourse and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection in high-risk people by around 86%.
The NHS has agreed to fund a clinical trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year that the NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the authority's own claims that the drug should be funded by local authorities instead.
Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, hailed the move, which was unveiled on Thursday as a "newly large-scale intervention" while the National Aids Foundation (NAT) described it as a "revolt moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, with more clinics to be introduced in October before the programme will be introduced across England by April 2018.
Pre-existing prophylaxis (PrEP) is a hottest on HIV drugs that are taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are enough certain drugs in the human body that prevent HIV from becoming infected.
Such medications can be taken daily or no later than two hours before intercourse.
Candidates eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and cannot receive treatment.
Clinics identify suitable people who are willing to take part in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-born partner does not receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a GP there can also register their wish at the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme will cost 10 million pounds and NHS England has signed a contract to get the drugs this week after an international procurement procedure.
The aim of the clinical trial is to assess the true potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in the big picture.
Mr Stevens said: "This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of struggle with one of humanity's greatest health challenges.'
Deborah Gold, NAT's executive director, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is correctly targeted at those who need it and is at risk, offers the possibility of changing the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at high risk of HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and does not depend on negotiating with a partner, through this NHS-funded clinical trial.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now it is essential to ensure that clinical trials are rolled out quickly across the country and that no HIV risk group is excluded.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been obtained, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people who are at risk of contracting HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, shadow public health minister, said: "The start of a clinical trial for the PrEP is very welcome and well overdue after months of delays and dragging the government's feet.
Evidence shows how much change this drug can bring to prevent HIV and the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial brings us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is introduced as soon as possible across the country to protect people who have exposure to HIV and to bring us one step closer to stopping HIV spreading in society."
Electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania fell.
In July, the difference in the next day's stock price between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering said.
The main reason for the price difference is the Lithuanian-Swedish Community failures.
In Estonia, the average stock price for electricity was 34.33 euros per megawatt hour last month, and the price rose 12 percent from June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by 5 per cent to 36.27 euros per megawatt hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17, while the price of the Nord Pool of electricity was EUR 26.37 per megawatt hour.
Prices rose by 12 per cent and seven per cent respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved in 75 percent of last month's hours towards Estonia and 16 percent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of the hours did not take place between the two countries the next day.
Electricity was flowing between Estonia and Latvia 99 per cent of the time from Estonia to Latvia, and 73 per cent of the hours had total transmission capacity.
On the last trading day of July, the Nasdaq OMX market could see the price of electricity in August at around 34 euros per megawatt hour and 37 euros per megawatt hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide, which influences electricity production prices, rose last month and the deals came at a price of 5.04 to 5.47 euros per tonne.
Living high - a semi-detached and smart design nipples have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a roomy home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate creed, swaologed her large Knightsbridge home for the Earls Court flat in 2014.
It is on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold her flat on is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived on a much bigger surface in Knightsbridge with my ex-partner," Joanne said.
'I've done something that would be the equivalent of the price I'd offered.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and had similar high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.'
Since the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a full renewal.
At first it was a single bedroom and a complex layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to reach the bedroom; Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a semi-detached floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
'I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azad from the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed in Notting Hill to take advantage of 3.8m ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development site, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling wasn't high enough to add two rooms to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a semi-detached floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
"The metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
'We had to reorganise the spaces so they'd be on top of each other without having to bow.
It wasn't just about building a platform, we used a steel structure to make sure both the upper and lower spaces were right.'
This position allowed Erfani to create two full-alt-h rooms in the room, along with plenty of dramatic elements.
The semi-truck is viewed from the glamorous living space beneath the window of the old-fashioned copper light from the Retrovius window.
The mirrored golden furniture, silver detailing and the retro-filled Serge Mouille lighting accentuate the style of the space.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the inclusion of theatricality, spatiality and abstinence.
At both ends of the short corridor, mirrors have been added to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror gives the impression of another window opening in the room.
At the entrance, the mirrored cabinet offers a storage venue for all of Joanne's meals and glassware.
Adding to the living room is the chance to close the kitchen section if it is not used, creating an image of a more glamorous space.
Concrest-campaising kitchens are nothing new.
But the unique fact in this kitchen is that it's a garage-type up-to-ear-to-earth door.
"It was a bit of a design pain," Erfan explains of the door of the MDF sprinkled with a terrain.
'It's a counterweight, so it glides very easily when you push it up.'
Thanks to the clever use of the space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra rooms, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"At the end of the day, the floor area is what you're selling - or the one that gives value to the property," Erfan says.
"The property agent enters the room in an outdated form and does the calculations based on the area of the floor," he said.
Here they have been able to increase the floor space, using high-quality materials that add luxuriousness to the space.
"Materjals are what you touch and that help create an emotional bond with your home," Erfan says.
'You don't fall in love with the electric cable on the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make your heart ring.'
It shows that good design and enhanced space help make a fairly ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even create a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
The chief character, Dane Jensen, is a chief fundraist in a Chicago skyscraper who competes with a colleague for his professional height.
It counts nothing but the amount of money you earn, with all ethics being forgotten.
The man sees his wife and three children only in the early hours and late evening.
In the first half of the film, I find myself thinking that this is, after all, a version of the business world of "The House of Cards" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech is similar.
The more the film goes, the less the cavalry-clearing element will remain, and the moralizing intent of the filmmakers is starting to look more and more.
A life-changing experience is the protagonist's son's illness of cancer.
Now there needs to be a choice between work and family life.
The son, who dreams of an architect's office, makes his father think about really important things like faith, kindness, love, not even a twin tower disaster, on their feet in Chicago's grandstands.
After the third scene in which the son opens his father's eyes, one gets the feeling that the filmmakers have been guided by the goal of getting the audience to cry, because even the most icing viewers can't hold back tears when seeing the suffering of a beloved cancerous boy.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation looks almost hopeless, the father understands the immorality of his work and does a good job for an old man looking for a job.
Now I bet on myself - if the film has a happy one, I reward my perception after the film with coffee, if I'm wrong, you can praise the screenwriter for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a suspicion that I will miss a coffee - when his wife calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes toward the corridor in a slow-moving way.
But the son is wonderfully healed, and although his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be a positive, because now there is time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well!
To be honest, the film is well-designed; all the elements needed for it exist.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the moral is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
It will probably bring the film in good.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico reports that the White House's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information from President Trump, including news, in the hope it will keep the boss in the water.
Here's a transcript from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the White House's new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with high-ranking officials on his first day on his first day, he outlined a key issue in President Donald Trump's White House, which he planned to solve - getting bad information into the president's hands," he said.
Kelly told officials that the information "sucissible needs to go through him, whether on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried to do so, and they have failed to tatty Trump with monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV viewing habits haven't gone away.
"While candidate Trump was upset about unfair media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also featured in the publications that were affected," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "the key to managing Trump's Twitter habits is key to controlling Trump's Twitter habits when it comes to ensuring that his personal media consumption is also a stable boast."
Well, well.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits have once been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign staffers know something the rest of us don't know - that Trump's tweets would have been even more sparkling without their interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't post.
When his assistants were able to save him from mischief a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from consistently stir in the controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is competing with each other, people are trying exclusively to promote their own interests by passing material to Trump that supports their worldviews but may not always be credible.
Politico, which covers the entire story, wrote in May about advisers' propensity to feed the president with strategically questionable information.
One example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is:
"Today and former Trump subordinates say Trump may be reacting to a negative press, particularly damaging leaking, exploded, obsessed with finding out their source of origin.
That's what happened in late February, when someone gave the president a copy of an article on GotNews.com, a website owned by online provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing the deputy chief of staff, Katie Walsh, of being the White House's "suffest source of a leaflet."
It doesn't matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of the mockery, or that he didn't offer any specific evidence or that he has made and withdrawn false accusations in the past.
Trump read the article and began asking subordinates about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-Senator Reince Priebus and White House Cabinet Office spokesman Rob Porter "have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting Trump's entry-level documents."
How did it work?
Kelly is trying to do exactly the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will be a more effective leader than Priebu, but Trump remains impulsive and his aides are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad to the capital are not scraled for permission to perform.
There are a lot of foreigners kissing in the centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom Fairfax Media spoke admitted to playing in the Old Town without permission from the city government.
We first found three street musicians near the gates of Viru who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clear that the musicians with raspbloths and bloss. gowns were backpackers who would take one shower away.
Despite the excitation, the only woman in the group played a story with an amusing rhythm on the chord, while one of the men sclerated with three balls next to him and called passers-by.
A third man had been sitting next to them in one of his backpacks and was smoking himself in a heartbeat.
Their three dogs didn't allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing crowd.
Bob, who played the chord with Noem and balls, said he was kissing in the streets for both fun and money.
The aim of the group's appearance was to collect fare for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day.
Asked if they asked permission from the city for a kiss in the Old Town, Noemi and Bob shook their heads.
First, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or two and, for the most part, promises will be given for a month or something like that.
There's no point paying for it," Bob explained.
When we got back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at the musicians and chasing them away.
The community moved to the intersection of the Virginia Centre with backpacks and dogs to try their luck.
Three Polish young men also appeared on the street, one playing violin, the other playing clarinet and the third even carrying an electronic piano.
"We're here to provide entertainment for people to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living," explained the trio's pianist Mivosh.
Mivosh said they are aware that there must be permission from the town hall to appear.
"Obviously we don't have that," he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we'll go elsewhere, but we have to try," he added.
The Bank of Estonia bought the euro area's central bank's public asset purchase program in July for 149 million euros, while the central bank's bond portfolio grew to 4.36 billion euros.
The central bank does not release more details about the purchases.
Responding to a question from members of the National Assembly, Hardo Hansson, the governor of the Bank of Estonia, has previously explained that the asset-purchasing plan for the euro system's central banks includes three different purchasing programmes: financial sector-covered bonds (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank is buying bonds from the market to encourage investors who sell bonds to invest money elsewhere.
As a result of the buy-things, lower-risk asset yields will fall and this will incentivise investors to take greater risks.
As a general rule, as part of a public bond-buying program, each central bank buys its government bonds; other countries' bonds are not purchased.
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds, the Bank of Estonia is making so-called replacement buys within the volume allocated to them.
Asset buyers are also in those countries where the supply of bonds that meet the purchase plan is limited.
The Bank of Estonia generally buys bonds of European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank, according to Hansson.
The Bank of Estonia will buy bonds as part of the asset purchase programme from March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering's bonds were also acquired, but from June 2016 the Bank of Estonia will no longer buy Elering's bonds.
On behalf of central banks in the euro area, both Elering and Estonian Energy will be buying bonds from June by the Finnish Central Bank.
Migrants ignore ditch and return to 'millionaires' district'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners have once again come under fierce confrontation with determined travellers who have been trapped in a council-covered ditch to reclaim their field away from their villas.
Migrants have parked their 20 trailers on the field near Solihull Street, dubbed the wealthy "millionaires" district.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after they were only kicked out in May, not to be distracted from a ditch dumped by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the protective boundary, squeezing its vehicles through an unblocked part that had been left on foot.
Related residents have been axed by Solihull council, saying the council is "useless" in dealing with the problem.
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after they were evicted from Bentley Heath where they were stoned by passers-by.
The council must be ashamed to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The royers were there in May, they were driven away and now they are back again.
They came in last night, probably more today."
He added: "Birmingham council knows how to deal with these things by getting long sneakers to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy that I have to continue paying council tax if the council can't even stop this kind of thing.'
One local resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's ridiculous, we only saw how the last of these migrants left and there is a new offensive going on.
This time the number has increased and even a horse has been seen in grassland.'
A spokesman for Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite on the land near Streetsbrook Road and we are working with Solihull Police and we are taking the necessary legal action to get them moving as quickly as possible.
Evidence is very helpful when as many local residents report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling on 101.
It helps to create a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them."
The Weekend Festival will be visited by Culture Minister Indrek Saar, among others, who is delighted that real world names have been brought to Estonia.
Asked why the Weekend Festival is so important to Estonians, Saar says it should be asked of all those who will fully enjoy the festival's three days.
But he says there have been real players in his field.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been able to be brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre will be brought home - that doesn't happen in our hey one," says the culture minister.
But which artists perform at the festival are the island most?
I consider myself a relatively old person, and for old people like me, there's definitely one of the most experienced artists, Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
"He's a record-breaking thing for all of us has been twisting our feet at some point," he says.
But he still points out a number of names, such as the Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian players too: starting with NO-P and can be read a whole series of them.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high," he says.

Audi upgrades up to 850,000 diesel vehicles amid criticism of carmakers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would provide software updates for more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believed there were "smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities including the BMW's home town of Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engine emissions.
None of the companies described the actions as a recall.
European carmakers have been keen to promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with regulations for CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
It will also increase the cost of equipment for car industry to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German carmakers are under a thorough investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of cheering powerful carmakers and ignoring signs pointing to the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes, which tainted the use of so-called scams, which allowed the emissions to be adjusted to meet regulations while testing the car but pulled back in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics subset of Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may go on trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany after authorities accused the audit of installing a system to evade European emissions requirements, expanding an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could be a major blow for Volkswagen - the luxury car maker generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
Estonian schools will be acquired for EUR 20 000 of the European Union's flags.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy European Union flags for Estonian schools by 1 September.
In total, the size of 105x158 centimetres of the European Union flag will receive 570 educational institutions.
Flags are designed for display indoors and must also be carried out in high-quality printing indoors with tunnel fixtures, the ERR news website reports.
The flagpole is marked with the text: "The Queen for Estonian schools to mention the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union of Estonia.
The estimated cost of the 570ft flag is estimated by the Department for Education to be worth EUR 20 000, or one flag will cost EUR 35.
Journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
Workers at the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, soaked up by organized crime, corrupt officials and relentless drug wars.
But today, under the guise of personal tragedy, they have gathered to discuss their own safety.
They are told it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss which seems safer: either to bring their children to an office with them, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a billboard at the top of the room: "enemy," "neutral", "little."
They ask reporters to provide names for each column - no evidence, enough impressions and inner feelings.
Drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being employed by the government or cartels - a whole list of madmen who make it dangerous to cover the chaos in Mexico.
There is no reshunting of violence, and the more bodies mount up across the country, the majority of them are made up of journalists - according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, there have been at least 25,589 journalists in at least 25,589 journalists in seven states since President Enrique Pena Nieto was sworn in December 2012.
Recent deaths include their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The most important mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence makes him feel deeply felt, though his presence can be felt everywhere - there is a large picture of Valdez showing his middle finger, along with the letter "Justice" and two reporters in his 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts depicting his smiling glasses with his face or a pancake hat.
The meeting comes less than two months after his death; reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, their insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate state prosecutor's office was set up to deal with the case of journalists in 2010, only two cases have been prosecuted, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related homicides, the number in which it reaches thousands, the killers of journalists rarely face trial.
Riodoce's editorial continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the assassins' data and fairness, the security meeting will be of no great benefit, Ibarra said.
"It's very stupid to waste your time at this meeting," he says.
'As long as the cause isn't known, you're incredulous for everyone.'
Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital, Cuacan, on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive just a few quarters before two men stopped him in a red Toyota Corolla; he was forced to get out of the car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the newspaper, which translates as "twenties."
The man, who was acquastowed in Valdez's car, and made an accident nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left behind by a woman and two adult children.
Rumours are spreading freely in Culiacan.
But there is essentially silence about Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival clerks battle to fill a power writ.
It doesn't matter that on the streets of Sinaloa, some people are shot every day, or that the cemetery is abducted from abducted double drug-dealing mausoleums larger than many living homes.
Let us forget for a moment that the peacetime refers to the fact that only one cartel runs the seaside state with valuable ports and the drug routes leading to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce's co-founder and chairman, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, feels a huge incriminator that he was unable to defend his friend.
He believes the killing was facilitated by two errors.
The first was the publication of an interview with Dammao Lopez, a cartel competing with the sons of a cartel competing with the warrior, in February.
This piece may have angered the sons - the suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they arrived at newspaper kiosks.
Another mistake was that Valdezi was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid took place in another newspaper editor who covered the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been alive for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would be there forever.
He was working as a veteran reporter for the Noroes newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said Sinaloa "was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
The newspaper gained prominence over time with its bold and honest coverage, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish powerful studies without fear of censorship and readers were fascinated by the print they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its Latin American coverage.
In the same year, the Valdez Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) won the International Press Freedom Award for its courage to follow the Mexican drug story wherever it leads.
He openly admitted he was afraid.
"I want to keep living," he said, accepting the AKK Award.
Last October, he said in an interview with the TV channel Shafiviento TV that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
'You have to embrace the task that comes with the journalistic office - another way is to play foolish.
I don't want to be asked what I did when faced with so many deaths or why I didn't talk about what was going on.'
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a jockey who roared like a sergeant, a friend who kindly shared embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the El Guayabo bar across the road and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his love of routine was fatal to him.
His death has also made them question themselves how best to do their job and stay alive.
'They don't like to be liared with these women, their children, their legal business, their secret landing sites that are used to transport drugs.'
"These things should not have been touched," Bojorquez said.
The result, even at the best of times, is strong self-censorship and self-confidence.
Confidence in your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, said the problem is that "the smell can be deceiving... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply to the toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt public officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed in the room where Riodoce staff met for security training; a few days before it was revealed that spyware sold to governments alone had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers searched for relief from the 40-degree heat in the shadow of a tree.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office, a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Caulicani.
Some reporters pondered whether these police officers were among the 50 percent of police officers who the governor himself has branded unreliable.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to mountainous rural areas where control is de facto drug gangs.
Riodoce's edition this week addressed three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing gunman Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had a revealing story of spending government funds on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were robbed of one of Cauliacani's most expensive restaurants, a quarter from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows - the restaurant is a place for both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the last century.
Recently, several IRP governor have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the same location, including how Guzman's son, who goes by the nickname El Chapo, escaped from a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched a column for Valdez to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have already known what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose sticky bodybuilding has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been cut off," he said.
Valdez's office has become a storage space for labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they never expected - activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a pair of tag and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been found and officials said it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal and are screaming the phrase "SOS Press" on pavements and buildings as an organised protest.
On that day, Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., in an attempt to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death, meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
Afterwards, he asked for him to be diverted from the government's coverage of the action, worried that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said Mexican journalists were "limited" by organized crime, complicit public officials and indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Some journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who are in a mede with organized crime.
Media captionAriculo 19, the media watchdog group Articulo 19, awarded more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and public officials last year.
"In Mexico, you die because you want to be silenced," Ramirez said.
The murders are clearly bloody.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found along with a letter believed to have been signed by the cartel Los Zetas: "I am here for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were leaning next to his cut-out head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the El Norte newspaper in Chihuahua, a northern border state, following the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others are letting go as the El Manana de Nuevo Laredo newspaper did after their president's murder in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez newspaper publicly spoke to the drug cartel with the headline "What do you want us to do?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a nerve-racking decision.
It's hard to find work in the exile and they still have to snee in the streets to avoid the dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, as is presumably the case of photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in a cottage in a Mexico apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay put and continue to work have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that he is intimidated by the coverage of the drug business.
"Mcico is on my way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked in, Riodoce's editors sat on the pavement in front of the office and roasted beer when everyone's phones suddenly started vibrating.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people had been killed in a firefight between rival gangs and security forces.
The ft continued to escate, as promised by a number of messages left by cartels found in the area.
From the same edge of the pavement, reporters put the news on a cellphone on Riodoce's website.
The next day's frontman needed a change.
The sirens hunched along - another exchange of fire in the area.
Bojorquez lased to call on police officers to see if they were vigilant.
If they were afraid, at least they didn't show it.
Under a massive portrait of the newspaper's fallen founder, showing his middle finger across Sinaloa, Riodoce staff followed his footsteps.
"How could you even think about closure," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day Javier was killed, the apprentice asked for me to send him to the streets for a report?"
Dinosaur used defensive colour to prevent enemies
At first glance, it feels like a shape, albeit rather scary.
Scientists have now uncovered the first findings of an incredible rhino horn-size creature discovered by a Canadian miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as a "dinosaur Mona Lisa."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to establish that the skin covered in her armour was red-brown in colour and her past had been somewhat "completely."
The report, published in the journal Current Biology, described the creature as "the best preserved armored specimen ever found" and "one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
Fossil is a new species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the chalk era, 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation stunned scientists, who describe it as "really remarkable."
This vegetarian, co-covered with jelly, is the best preserved fossil once found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 as he mined a Suncorn Mint near Fort McMurray, North Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that didn't resemble the rock around him and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, the animal was being excavated from a 2,500-pound (1100-kilogram) plot of land.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to go public.
"If you look a little bit, you can almost believe that he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs," he said.
While studying his skin, the researchers found that this plant eater, while covered in armour and resembling a walking tank, was likely significantly endangered by meat-eating dinosaurs.
This dinosaur with abundant swamps used red and white defensive paint to hide from predators and applied a shade technique called retweets and also used by many modern animals.
This, experts say, allowed the dinosaurs to better immerse their surroundings and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt for him.
This 110-year-old creature belonging to the Nodosaurs family first came to the news in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory lab of the Borealopelta brandmicell museum, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours exposing the animal effortlessly.
Thanks to the astonishingly good preservation of the creature, Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the animal's body.
They discovered a counter-eclshit - a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the onion side of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although the relegal is widespread, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than the animals with the counter-sected animals living today.
This suggests that other meat-eating dinosaurs were actively hunted down enough of the dinosaurs that the evolution preferred to survive instead of confrontation.
But most of today's animals using the eclipse - such as scarves, sebrises or armadills - are much smaller and more vulnerable as crops, suggesting that the nodosaurus really had to struggle to survive.
"The vigorous hunt for a dinosaur covered in large and abundant armour shows how dangerous predatory animals from chalk age dinosaurs may have been," Brown said.
A chemical analysis of organic compounds of the Finnish also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its intestines to find out what the animal ate for its last nod.
They believe the dinosaur fell into the river when it died, thus reaching the sea with a flow, where it sank to the ocean floor in front of it.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it was now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to stretch farther inland than they do now.
"This nodosaurus is truly significant because it is fully covered in preserved saliva skin, but it has also remained three-dimensional, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
'As a result, the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the chalk era.
You don't have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it - just shaking your eyes and it feels like she's sleeping.'
Crystal age was a time when huge muscular dinosaurs - the tepids - were swept up on Earth by the huge two-fight-moving meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although the king of all of them, Tyrannosaurus, lived millions of years later than the Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been hunted by some of his terrifying predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-fish (11.5 metre) long and weighing six tonnes.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology believe Borealilta was swept into the sea after death and mutilated in the mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011, by Shawn Funk when he mined a mine at the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray, North Aberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is best preserved in the world of saliva dinosaurs, including skin and armour, and it is integrated from couman to hips.
These creatures were 18 feet (five feet) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-ft-long orangutan penetrated its shoulders.
Scientists believe this vegetarian-filled plant eater trampled through the current western shore until a flooded river swept into the sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial ground helped preserve its saliva in excellent detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular creature are so well preserved that the icnished arches along the dinosaur's tops still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine: "This degree of survival is as rare as a lotto win.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it feels.
Stone-enabled skin remains still cover the mysterious armoured plates on the animal's collar.
The right front leg leans next to him and five sleeves are tied upwards.
I'll be able to count the armouredings on his fence.'
How did one activist find an answer to the question "Who's the streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was in a complete shock.
Just a day after travelling to New York, this St. Louis resident sat on a bed in a rented room with Airbnb, browsing on Facebook on his phone.
He ended up on top of his former schoolmate's post.
It read: "Police have just killed an 18-year-old adolescent and he is still lying in the street."
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on his stream, so he shut down Facebook and launched Twitter.
Posts by the tweet @TheePharoh user had repeatedly been shared on his timeline.
The rapper, from the St. Louis area, relayed foot of sniper Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying in the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell said to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later saw a tweet again in the evening announcing people gathering on Canfield Drive.
Photographs of police tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown's father and holding a sign reading "Fergon police just killed my unarmed son!" was shared.
He watched a live stream in which a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a gang of dogs.
In another video, another police officer grinped a gun and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he hit himself with the thought: "It's unusual."
""This is not the kind of murder we are accustomed to and what we might call typical."
I felt scared at that point.
I was angry and crying.'
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
Having landed at 23, he went after his father to his six-year-old daughter and decided they would drive two to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is central to the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Whose Streets?"), which premieres in cinemas on August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the point of view of those who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter - who was wearing a floral dress and a matching crown on her head - drove to Ferguson again, they chatted back at what they had repeatedly talked about earlier this morning - about the experiences and living conditions of black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for your rights?" he recalls asking himself.
'We're going to Ferguson at the moment because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right.'
"I couldn't take him," Ferrell said later.
'What's happening now is the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow up in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about activism and organisation, while also knowing the different layers of black experience and living conditions and what we need to do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise him so that he doesn't experience blatant racism in person, he's no different from another black girl.
I feel like I'd do him a disservice if I'd protect him from this world.'
The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a venue across the road from a police station that had become a kind of campsite where activists were waiting for news about police officer Darren Wilson, who was never charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who was preparing lunches.
They put together bags of food and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of St. Louis, Missouri-St., he was president of the Alliance for Minorities and focused on food fitness and health inequalities in black communities.
'I didn't have any organisational experience.
It's all just going on.'
Days later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the film's co-creator, during the evening's rally.
Folayan said he and filmmaker Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was going on.
The question was asked in Ferrell's head: "Are you trying to document what's going on or finding a story that can be exploited?"
This scepticism was the result of countless cases in which people - often white supremacists - come into the community and try to profit from its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We've heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are not being listened to, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already shaken hands with fellow director Damon Davis, an artist known for his activism in relation to death row inmates.
His involvement made the project appealing to Ferrell and six other locals who were watched by the film's "Whose Streets?" team for years after Brown's shooting.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
"It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm portrayed," he said.
While the aim wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement wasn't "a red-curricing guide, but a community gathering," as Folayan put it - he became the film's most open player.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" is surprisingly documenting personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the finished line-in.
"But I realized that doing this job and humanising black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability," he said.
What's more, Ferrell's story re-emphasise and puts the role of a black gay woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders who tweeted on social media after the 2012 killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin hashtag #BlackLivesMatter are gay.
"In a role, black gay women have maintained the movement in general," Ferrell said, "and that's because we have to keep fighting on many fronts.
Black gay women must bear all this burden.'
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women, and many of them are black gay women."
But he argues that "it's not a kind of equal opportunity-making thing" - Ferrell wasn't chosen as the center of the film because of his identity.
"He was someone who blew the right energy," he said.
'But it's no coincidence that she was right on the front line because there's a lot at stake when she's a black gay woman who lives in such hubs.
His energy can be perceived through the screen.'
Meanwhile, news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and police remain fragile.
The suspended sentence for blocking a highway to Ferrell during a demonstration will last another 2.5 years.
He describes the sociopolitical atmosphere in an area he calls home simply a "thorough risk."
Nevertheless, he still sees the mantra he has eaten into the memory since he took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our responsibility to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
7 tips to get over the booth after a Weekend party
Some of the stubborn male boy will find help after a nasty party.
Or they follow the saying "avoice bombshell, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable delay and a decent health spree.
What can you do to feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow's Weekend trash - or the other party - and get over the bombshellest as possible?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and after, after a big party in the morning ... or possibly even instead of alcohol.
Because the body loses a lot of fluid when you consume alcohol, it needs to be recovered somehow.
Along with water, minerals are also swept out of the body and it is therefore good to drink mineral water.
As the snake is often irritated after a nap, it's particularly good if it's bubble-free or just lightly gassed.
Go for a walk.
It certainly wouldn't be worth going to your grandmother to break down trees - it could be a fatal misjudgment.
But a light walk helps your body to remind you again what it's like to be alive.
lying in a cot and sleeping out a booth is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give the body the energy back slowly and carefully.
If you're already vomiting from yesterday's overdrive, it's certainly not worth trying to load a large fatty pee into your stomach.
Start with fresh juice, for example, where fruit sugars are quietly boosted by your body.
If your health is already suffering around lunchtime, you might try pulp.
And shortly afterwards, the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diurometry releases your body from the last water.
As has already been said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't contribute to painkillers.
If you take a painkiller in the evening to prevent a hangover, your liver will have to deal not only with alcohol, but also paracetamol or ibuprofen, and thus loses performance.
This way you spoil your liver even more and in the future the hangovers are worse.
In addition, the painkiller doesn't last very long anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it with a completely empty stomach - it irritates your already stricken stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you get along well with yourself.
It feels like walking, but you can't have an orgasm when you walk.
Avoid too active a pace and crazy hangover - physical exertion should be moderate during a bombshell.
Make a joke.
Time to talk to friends and co-strshod, make easy ghosts and smile amicably about yourself and others (the hurts).
The joke and laughter may not drive away the booze, but surely they'll be more fun to have the afterlife.
Once the bombshell goes over anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University staff sought on suspicion of murder
A University of Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee have been searched nationwide after finding the body of a man with fatal stabbing at a luxury apartment in Chicago, police said.
According to Cook County court documents, arrest warrants were issued without bail on Monday for arresting 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on charges of first-degree murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after being repeatedly stabbed.
The body was discovered on July 27, according to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community.
Police officers received a phone call and found the victim, who had multiple gunsled wounds, when they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
Officials said Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators are treating the stabbing as a murder while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co-founder of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public affairs, said in an emailed statement that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from his job and has been barred from entering the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case being investigated by the competent authorities and the University of Northwestern is cooperating with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior fellow in the finance department at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist the US investigating authorities in any way possible."
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to extradle himself.
Anthony Guglielmi, director of the Chicago Police Department's communications department, urges the suspects to give themselves to authorities.
"Police have an idea of where they are, but we are working more and more intensively to define the exact location," Guglielmi said.
Gugliemi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to look for the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza apartment block, which had just received a cryptic allegation that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to police descriptions, it was a vivid spectacle.
Gugliemi said it was not clear whether the event itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren were staying in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The Grand Plaza management sent a letter to residents saying: "Police are currently working on the chronology of events and are investigating the background to the victims and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that this was a family dispute."
Self-drived companies to help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce start-up, but the polls were futile.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse still, misleading.
And even if he vowed to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"This system just wasn't consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company that sells hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called for help for outsiders.
New types of human resource start-ups are emerging to help companies find out what their employees feel.
In developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and a hot line for complaints, and in some cases allow language carriers to bypass C-level managers and, in some cases, to bypass C-level managers and turn directly to the board.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said he's got a much better idea of what his staff thinks and feels like in the three years he has used Glint.
In addition to flash studies and surveys aimed at specific teams, it provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest level of support, allowing them to identify the reasons.
Companies are beginning to realize that they need to stay up to date with their workplace culture so as not to become the next Uber, which has been embroiled in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing a harassing environment punishing those who dared to speak out.
For start-ups like Glint, the desire to have a review is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance could be worth more than USD 118.7 billion by 2020, according to data from the financial technology statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a Colorado-based start-up in Denver, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, noted an increase in interest and activity this year against a backdrop of Uber's suspicious reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized impulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous line of message that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when the CEO is involved, the complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been anchored by regulatory authorities," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercenti.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain that has more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and operations and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporation's headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he or she had to find a telephone number or email address at the company's headquarters, make a formal complaint and hope it would be taken seriously.
It was often a daunting and inconvenient process, said James Vitrano, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no good way to monitor employee complaints.
But now that the company is using Convercenti, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that did not previously reach managers operating offices in other cities or states can be more quickly identified and dealt with.
"I'm able to get closer to the Holistic 360-degree experience of the employees," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
'And we're protecting our shareholders from litigation with employees.'
Quinlan said companies began taking ethical behavior, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, after auditing firm Arthur Andersen collapsed amid ethical violations in connection with the Enroni scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media got ripe" that the companies realized they couldn't stop their blackwashing being publicly washed up online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors who have been in support of both start-ups.
Convercenti was funded by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February to the tune of 10 million dollars, raising the value of the capital raised to 47 million dollars.
Glint invested 10 million dollars in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the company's total funding to 60 million dollars.
Such investments come as no surprise given the link between companies, culture and venture capital.
More research shows that modern workers expect more from the job than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they are devoting their time to a company that has a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, they feel they're being listened to and that the work they're doing is satisfying, they're more committed to the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice president of general benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercle and Glint.
Investors will earn income when companies in their portfolios are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics are promising to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they'll find support.
Being embedding knowledge about employee engagement is important, according to workplace culture experts.
But these data will be useless if the company's followers do nothing about them.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can raise expectations that changes lie ahead.
And if the changes don't happen quickly enough or not, it can cause disappointment and reduce the involvement of workers.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of Cotter International, a consulting and business management company that has seen companies make a mistake of relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things don't end, the staff think, "Did you actually hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?""
Errett said Madison Reed, who now conducts surveys once a month among staff, has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees frustrated with the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams at the company and provide communication training to address the problems.
But Ruby Tuesdays will collect new data on workers and it is hoped that in the long term it will lead to a longer-term commitment of workers in an industry known for its high flow of labour.
"If you're not committed to transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
'And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you'll lose businesses.'
The shining star of the euro area is the Baltic: incomes are rising fast
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes, referring to the European Central Bank report.
According to the Central Bank, total annual economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations since 1999.
Success is driven by low debt, fast-moving institutions and business and free-market-friendly policies.
"Baltic countries, along with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where real GDP per capita has been significantly closer to the EU average," the central bank said.
Although the aim is for total annual production per capita to equal the richest Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita amounted to just two-thirds of the average of 15 countries belonging to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Baltics to seek better pay abroad.
While the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, local residents are not at all enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, just under half of those surveyed thought so of their country's economies.
NCAA decision to cancel double-day stairs makes Bruins days long
It's nearly 23, when a troupe of UCLA football players stop for a chat on the edge of a new practice field on the team's university campus.
Some have dressed their shirts off their backs, revealing their backs from their first day of training camp.
For the vast majority of the team, these minutes of force offer a midday break.
Players attending summer courses will head back to public housing for final exams after a three-hour stroll before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre for meetings at 6.30am the next morning.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the double-boosting exercises to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer - at least until the final exams are reached on Friday.
That's why UCLA's first three workouts were timed to start at 7:15 to fit into the players' already busy schedule.
The transition from two training sessions a day means more days with one-out time - the start of the Bruins' training camp was lifted almost a week ago than last season, and for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons will have their workouts during the summer courses.
They are scheduled to play 18 games until August 20 before formal preparation for September's opening game against Texas A&M.
Mora said he is in favour of the NCAA rule change, though it adds another item to the players' busy schedules.
"They have a huge load for three or four days and that's a real challenge," Mora said.
'And they're breaking through this ordeal; they're struggling, they're great young.
I think when Saturday arrives and we have more time, it's really fun.'
Once the camp has ended, UCLA's workouts will be closed, which is no easy task given the clear view of their squares from a nearby parking lot and an adjacent Luskin Center, a high-prof outer hotel that has already hit the goalpost with footballs that surround the defensive net.
Bruins players have occupied the hotel since this weekend, but Mora acknowledged there could be problems with free rooms during the season.
"We are taking security measures," Mora said.
'It's a real concern and it's not exaggerated to think people can rent a room and film a workout from there.
If you have a record from training, you can do a pretty good deal with it.
But we're using a security team there and in the 8th parking lot.
We will do the best we can.
I try not to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place.'
The Savisaar-Ivanova electoral alliance, which was born in retaliation for the Centre Party, Kristiina Ojuland, expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, who was forced out of the ECRE, will be a part of the business, the electoral alliance of Tallinn and the party members who are hoping to show their seats to the party - it seems that at least as many of the parties will take part in local elections this year.
But the tweaters will be seen in the fall, and the key will be whether there will be enough frustrated voters for all of them.
Who will stay with Savile?
As support for Edgar Savile has dwindled, one can imagine events in honour of his electoral alliance.
One member of the National Assembly, some former and present centre-left parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And can there be any reason why some of Savile's loyal followers and friends are excluded from standing in Tallinn is being seen as becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the municipality for a Russian-language pop song involving a senior in the Las Vegas district; and, in every sense, a rudimentary computer game in which the protagonist, Prime Minister Jeremy Ratas, must avoid the sneaker and valleys on the way - is this how the party is trying to get the votes of 16 and 17-year-old voters allowed to go to the ballot box for the first time?
We look forward to seeing what other parties have in the youthful election campaign.
If Channel 2 or TV3 viewers are confronted with a black square instead of an entertainment show from the beginning of August, there will be two choices: accept that in future only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English-language France24 channels will be available, or to surrender 10 TVs to some TV operators every month.
There are probably those who initially rejoice in the ad-free TV experience in public, but ultimately - albeit reluctantly - pay for TV shows and ads.
The icing music, noisy folk and the rubbish left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
But if you don't want to be part of the melee, it's worth going home instead of hurting your head at home - and leave the bedroom to festival-goers for a hefty sum.
Washington changes green card rules
Media outlets quoted President Donald Trump as saying a new US immigration plan is being planned, changing the rules of the green card.
The plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The bill will go to the congressional chambers for debate.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money as it changes the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries," he said.
The law reduces chain migration and will replace the current program.
The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said, according to US media outlets.
The Siberian sediment are moving to the city, the pensioners back to the countryside.
Yevseyev's Anatoly continues the tradition of the famous sedimentary miners along the former River Maana.
He works as a driver in a gold arc on the Golden Artellite on the edge of the Maana tributary 140 kilometres from his home.
It's a tough job: two months in a row without rest days for 12 hours of work and then only 10 days at home and back again.
In the three years he has worked at Artelli, Anatoly has seen gold only once.
"There's a hard time: when you go in, there's a thorough check that you don't bring vodka, and when you go out that you don't take gold" - Anatoly says.
Mare Piho chats to local Seto John in the village of Haida, who has told him much about his family's memories in Siberia.
The archaic culture that has survived Siberian sediments is also starting to affect domestic setops, because it's just so fabulous, says Piho Mare, who has studied the most remote sediments.
His first research trip to Siberia is 30 this year.
During that time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a year in total.
How many sediments did they migrate to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to obtain land here?
This is an outstanding issue.
I would argue that 8,000.
I reckoned it according to the stories of the Siberian Seto men, who have thought about it themselves.
Exactly to say, as up to 30 people may have come in in one group at the time, but the passport was given only to the man.
The passport was given only to one, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look at how big the territory was here!
It was many times bigger than the historic Setomaa.
After all, it needed to be educated, managed in some way.
Settlements came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (pain rafting), gold mines, industry.
In New Pieter, for example, many of the sects later went to work in the classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (the Soviet regime was built by a uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the sediments make up the majority of the population in the region at the time?
Yes, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of marrying and multi-childhood was preserved for a long time.
Seven or two children in the family were common.
How much different the Siberian sediment culture differed and different from that of the Motherland sediments?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
They did it themselves, but they always made a distinction between what had been brought along and what had been done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional dress of the sediments, because it's colder.
Food changed.
For example, the meat was salted in Setomaa, but it was simply frozen here.
Where are the Siberian sect villages and what life there live there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The way the motherland was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now it's going to give Setumaa back there, it's going to affect them.
The girls who have lived in families here have listened to amazing stories.
Piho is referring to the people of the Estonian sediment delegation who came to Haida village in early July for the Day of the Seto Kingdom and lived in their homes for four days - J. P.
What's left here is fabulous.
"It's super-evolge to come and go away because the city has a great location: at a railway hub and at the crossroads of the road," says Reigo Tam, an opera singer from Tapa.
The city is not just a military capital anymore, we have a lot of nature, sporting and cultural places, and the pizza can be on every corner.
Tapa is a top-notch city!
There is a small island along the White River running through the city, where the killers tend to hold a hunting festivities.
"It doesn't look like this beautiful place in the train window," Reigo says.
Those who aren't afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
You can have a picnic on the river and just make romance - you can see the river flow and think ahead and back to life.
I've been there for walking with my brides.
The operatic dam, apart from everything else on the river bank, has been practicing its arias between the three bridges: "Because this place is on the outskirts of the city, no one might come up if I round up their own stories."
"There's a wonderful view of Tapa, but there's also health tracks where you can run, ski in winter and play discgolf for example - the golf course is done, the discs can be borrowed from the sports centre," Reigo leads.
The old props are there, of course, with their boobs, but I haven't got there yet.
You'll probably have to invite my colleague Rasmus Kull to visit Tapa because he's an experienced discgolf player and he has the discs.
Vast he lends me!
Reigo and Playhill were inseparable from the childhood of the current opera singer.
At least during skiing lessons.
There's a lot of tears left on this mountain, disappointments and wins in my sporting life.
Not to mention broken cheekholes and skis.
"The whole city of town is currently full of construction work, all of which will become unrecognisable," says Reigo.
But Tapa's old and tired scolded is a very attractive place to play summer shows.
I'm glad that in 2012, the head of the R.A.A.M., Mount Meos, embraced my idea and came to do a summer theater with his theatre.
While this year's theatrical season with "Alexei Karen" has just come to an end, on August 11, there's "Life to Walking" at the railway station, when the old sneaking around the 1980s.
"The days of the city of Tapa from 11 to 13 August, there will be an open home cafes in addition to the valle building and a series of cultural events, including a rally," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city on just day one.
The museum has been in the tiny yellow house on May 1.
"The time is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and there is a huge amount of information": Reigo praises a site full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on rail and warfare.
Reigo muscks that if Tapa goes through all the recommended places, the stomach will be empty for a long time, but luckily the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good meals and when we sit in cafes sometimes feel like you're abroad," he says.
Tradition and young soldiers who come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so when you sit there, you feel like you're in Estonia and your home town, but there's this international community together.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
There are soldiers, yes, we've got a lot going on!
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The broadcaster bTV quoted the Foreign Office as saying that two Bulgarians had been taken into custody in Greece for illegal camping.
Police arrested people who had been camping illegally on the Sithonia Peninsula on the morning of August 1, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but an investigation is currently under way.
The Foreign Office told broadcaster BTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on anyone who is caught resting in a place not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
The wolves who teach the cubs go to break down sheep.
Hijab farmers will have to give the wolves "learning material" from their herds once again after a year's break - the wolves apparently who have taught puppies have already broken up a lot of sheep.
So far this year, wolves have broken sheep in the county of Hiiu three times, with a total of 23 sheep and eight injured, the Herald Sun reports.
Last year the number was just three, 124 a year earlier.
There is also evidence from the Environment Agency that no wolf nests were born in the Himalayas last year, and the Hiiumaa hunting council has confirmed two wolf nests have been fixed on the island this year.
On Monday night, 15 sheep broke in the village of Kabuna in the municipality of Emma and injured 18 surviving sides of the sheep.
Early on Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in pasture in the village of Reheselja and seriously injured another who had to be given an emergency.
Rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs has sent a draft law on the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment to the law will abandon the creation of a separate dataset for both GM (GM) crop locations and handlers, using a future plant health register.
In addition, GM's obligation to have a prior agreement with a person working in a prescribed radius is amended.
Although GM crops are not currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non-GM crops.
That at least until it has been decided to declare Estonia GMO-free," said Sigmar Suu, head of plant health at the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"It must be taken into account that the measures developed must be purposeful and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens associated with both the private and public sectors," Suu added.
The bill repeals provisions related to GM crop locations and handling data sets and handling GM crops in GM's crop and operating requirements for agricultural treatment and economic activity.
Specific beekeeping will replace the current obligation of a GM farm grower to inform beekeepers of the start of GM's cultivation of arable farm with an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before starting cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to ministries for coordination.
All parties of interest will have the opportunity to see it in the draft information system and, if they so wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The proposed changes will have a particular impact on those involved in the field of plant farming, beekeepers and the Agriculture Authority.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810 - is allowed to grow.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no corn pest in Estonia, a European varrelieth, for which corn is MON 810 resistant.
The varieties of this maize line have also been bred for southern regions and this corn is not suitable for our climate conditions.
For the above, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect pollution from a variety of seeds of summer rape, corn and soy varieties grown in Estonia.
Analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and the study concluded that seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that GM crops are not deliberately grown in Estonia, and it has also been confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United recruited as 'genuine' in Nemanja Matic form
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matic after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, who has bought Chelsea for 40 million pounds, started in Dublin United's last pre-season game before a 2-1 win against Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, impressing in a defensive role while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go to the attacking cable.
But having missed the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Matinie was badly missed in the match and had only 45 minutes to go, according to Mourinho, who needs to improve from a solid start to the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant mentality - he has football," Mourinho said.
'We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible.'
Like Matic, other new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began to quietly put in place his 11th starting man for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed the club had already done a "greater job" by signing three of his four priority selections.
"I'm grateful to the club for being able to execute three of the four," he added.
'I'll be even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me.'
Another solo boy was hit by a GSM transmitter on August 1 and this time in Muhu.
According to mate Mati Martinson, a bird watcher living in the Ring, the first deer has been fitted with an squad and this nest eagle is already flying around, has left the nest site and joined a large collection of Mullutu-Big Bay.
This is because the Ring does not have grain fields, writes The Voice of the Islands.
This Tuesday, relatively late to ring the deer, another deer and it was on the Isle of Man.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project run by Mr Leito and Mr Ojaste.
Last year, a deaf boy named Mati was supplied with a GSM transmitter in the Ring of Tyjul.
"His doing things are all watching online: the way he went to Spain for a long time on the German and Polish border and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
British inventor allowed a microchip to fit into his body to get into a house and car with a handgun
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so he could open his front with a handgun, get to an office and even run a car.
Steven Northam, 33, has allowed a tiny chip to be fitted between his thumb and name-bomb and is now also offering the service to businesses and private individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anonyeologist at the Royal Hospital in Winchester, Hincher, to ensure that the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology resembles a microchip fitted to cats and dogs, and it takes just 30 seconds for the procedure.
Northam's company also replaces the locks of houses and cars to match them with chips, charging 300 pounds for a single lock.
The father of a married one-child has now installed the technology in his home and in his BMW Z4, which will be activated when his hand is on the steering wheel.
White House exec costing taxpayers thousands
According to military documents released to TIME, the White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter last month cost taxpayers as much as 24,000 dollars for the Southerner for an event celebrating American production.
The green and white colored Sikorsky VH-3D, dubbed Marine One while the president was on board, was a central attraction of the event showcasing American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials on their tour of industrial products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was exhibited along with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a fork lift made in Mississippi.
According to documents from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the drone responsible for the helicopter's operation, the White House warplane, requested the helicopter's presence with the commander, known as FARGO, for the helicopter landed in the southern courtyard for the "unorthodoxy."
"I wanted to know you would be aware of this because it's an unusually high-ranking event," the HMX-1 commander said in an email the day before the event to his boss, the Navy's top officer in the aviation industry.
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive in the southern courtyard for the event, which starts at 7am on the morning of July 17, and will remain there until the courtyard is cleared between 6 p.m. and 21 p.m.
Added to the fact that if leaving the White House is to be, a second equestrance will be needed for a return flight due to the restrictions on working time.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the squad's security team stayed near the plane throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read in the documents, published in TIME magazine, whether or not the second equest Wod was needed in the end.
Hatch's law prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether the event could violate this provision.
"We asked if this was breaking Hatch's law and we were told they would not violate," the commander wrote.
"It feels like you have no choice," the senior officer said.
The White House declared the event an "America-made" official event, and Hatch's law would not have covered it.
But even at official events, there are political undertones.
The president supported the efforts of health care reform that was debated in the Senate at the time and praised efforts to keep government regulations in place.
The use of the name Marine One or Air Force One for political lucrative purposes is no new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them for travel.
But the requirement to use them purely for a photo session is unusual.
Trump came under the spotlight in February when the president's plane rolled into the background at his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is littered with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the exhibition "American-made" display, which featured products from all 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform test flights around and south of Washington to practice putting down the US president's White House with centimetres of accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 test landings in the White House.
The official said the flight to the event was included in the "American-made" flight crew's training flights for that month.
The drone's helicopters flew another 11 hours that day for "non-president-related support missions."
The White House said no other exhibit at the event was loaded onto taxpayers' wallets.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organising the display in the southern courtyard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget documents for the president's flights and it is difficult to determine the exact costs of the event.
But according to the hourly rates of the Defense Department's 2017 financial year, the VH-3D compensation rate will be USD 24 380 per hour.
The scan documents indicated the flight was 30 minutes from its main base at the Navy's Quantico airport in both directions.
The White House says the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below its amount.
"It is very misleading to calculate the costs of payers on the basis of estimated compensation rates," Walters said.
"These estimated compensation rates include staffing, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are taken into account in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Department of Defense's compensation rates do not include staffing costs, but they cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the time at the event.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
'And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be contributing to our national security and that there are expected to be hundreds, if not even thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to do.
So, of course, it's right to highlight it.'
It's unclear whether or not Trump was involved in a helicopter while making a tour of the southern courtyard, but he sat behind the wheel of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives, joking to media outlets about the company's products in his personal fleet of aircraft.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit s'adeiko - through tears of peace and joy arrived
In Daegu in Daegu in 2011, Zadeiko was hit in the last area, an 800m run leg cramp and a lad was taken out of the stadium with a shotgun.
Shortly before that, he had received zero in the long jump in the World Champion Stadium in China.
The 2012 Helsinki EM was spoiled by a low-scoring injury, but at his debut in London, he was 23rd with 6013 points.
The misfort continued, however.
The 2013 Moscow champion suffered a hamstring injury in the long jump after the opening day.
Two years later, he was 15th in the Beijing World Championships and met the Olympic standard, but it was more of a disappointment for the athlete.
The toughest cavalry was only last year when he failed to record a result in the long jump at Amsterdam's EM.
I'd just like to put together a proper multi-playor event once.
One time," tweeted.
Worse still on the front: a month later his Olympic match in Rio was interrupted by a hamstring injury in the first hurdle.
Time had to be taken off - can we go on to the sevens race at all?
Is the two days of effort worth all this?
He thought for a long time, but found peace in himself.
I got my head cleaned
It's pretty hard to describe that experience, but I've thought last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Luckily, there was time to heal myself and clear my head.
"I knew I wasn't putting pills in my bag yet," says s'deco of his self-cleaning.
I was cleared and moved on with a new twist.
Trainer Anne Mountain said it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the caregiver, but she realised that the athlete herself needed to be clear.
After all, he was so buried by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove what he's worth," says Hill.
Now there's some peace in him.
He does it for his delight.
The competition came back in May, when sadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6,280 points in the Götzis multi-player competition.
He improved his personal best in the bullpen (13.89) and ran a record-breaking hurdle.
Then the multiplayer felt it wasn't a ceiling of ability at all, but that only the first face of competition had been erased.
Mountain, who has coached him for years, says that sadeiko is a mustor.
He's a ready-to-weath athlete, he's good at training.
If something does trouble or is wrong, he says it immediately.
He knows his own body and trusts his feeling.
That is what we need to do.
I cannot say exactly what we need to do and we will follow it.
A new approach has also found in the squad.
"I'm not the one who makes the most of the treadmill," he says, and says the most important thing is getting the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
Close baby luck makes for joy
Good emotions have also been given to the luck of close loved ones.
Both his former training partner, Maris Mountain, and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-athlete has received support from new weathermen.
"It's been quite interesting", says scion.
One alcohol whose drinking is tantamount to "training" the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is such a big fan of wine that he believes that wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
He said it wasn't about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather a "very active" process of tasting wine.
When weeping the glass, squeezing the wine in their mouths, enjoying it and sensing after taste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules do not actually contain flavor, but taste emerges from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He compares how the brain "shows" colors.
"The taste is not wine, the taste creates a wine tasting," says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the taste of wine, for example, are our age, our gender and even the amount of syringe that humans produce.
Sheperd, of course, admonishes that the wine isn't there to drink full of himself.
"There needs to be more in the character," he says.
If you take too big a sledge, the system is overstated.
Excessive wine drinking can harm the brain instead of beneficial - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine risk losing their balance and reduced mental capacity, according to a 2004 study.

UN says Afghan democracy depends on women's role in politics
The head of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play their role.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN aid mission, said hundreds of women are standing for local council elections, three women are standing for vice-president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of women's role," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only truly represent the people and be plausible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The elections and presidential elections for Afghan local councils will take place on 5 April.
For its part, the Taliban have threatened a electoral process that coincides with a transitional period in which the role of international military operations will be advised.
This year's elections mark the first time power has been handed over from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysomi said the strong role of women in democracy in Afghanistan will increase the success of democracy.
According to the Independent Election Commission in Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of distribution makes everything fierce for both big and small.
There's always too little time, but the treadmill is a good way to combine being together, game, closeness and load.
And what a handy solution - wherever you cruise in the summer, you'll always have live goggles with you and, with your fine voice, I'm impatiently reminding you, "Let's do the treadmill now!"
Start with the warm-up - a normal dome game or gliding along the beach strip is very good.
Cycling is the bedrock of staying in shape for legs and ashrams - who would want to take the shape of a sand duck swept by the waves over the summer?
It's wonderful to use children instead of heels!
Firstly, it is safe and comfortable; the weight is slowly growing at the same rate as the strength of the trainer.
The advanced ones can also make hills with quite great children.
The child trains balance, reads repetitions and feels the fun of the opportunity to walk high and be important.
Larger children, meanwhile, can make their own scoops.
The scope of the movement is determined by touching the ground and rolling up the arms.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini-assist to hold on properly.
The child can read replays and feel like a coach.
Plank is a super-lived exercise, but a hopelessly boring exercise for a child.
But it's easy to make it fun!
Game-plank: Take a long plank colony to keep up.
In fact, it's harder than usual, but much more fun to do than you can give a friend a hand in the meantime.
You can stay in plan, tiny turf, and walk around in that position to add to the burden.
It can make a youngest child sit on his hips, but this exercise is fun for all children.
While the crabs are squeaming on the sand, the streaks, ashes and abdominal muscles get loaded like a napkin.
The child descends onto his legs so that his body fat is equally distributed front and behind.
You can hold hands for security.
Sply your feet and straight up.
You can fly, have fun, balance and be a weight.
The life of a little coach is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every coming up.
The extra load is provided by the smadding of the legs.
Check that the back stays in a neutral position.
The children themselves have a lot more fun making their abdominal muscles in pairs and a plaza.
Hands and pulse scoop.
Keep your child's safety, knee position, and keep your back in a neutral position.
A favourite of all children and great fun!
Parents, meanwhile, really effective throughout the body tread.

From the Philippines to the wider world, a breed of breeding bag to the hearts of fashion fans
The bags bleached from the blisters are a summer classic that has become a stand-alone hit product in recent years, which even has to hang out with the right summer mogul and has been able to boil down to the hit price tag, despite its modest origins.
A bag of bleeding beers is probably one of those things that has existed every time in their lives and whose ownership hasn't caused much emotion.
It just exists and if it doesn't, nothing is broken.
But now the shoulder bags are making a real triumph, and fashion fans have swapped their fine designer bags for the summer months instead for simple strapless bags.
It's not just a beach bag, it's just as popular as a street bag, and braver women even walk into the office.
At this point, however, it's worth making it clear beforehand whether this summer's story will still sit for a boy, or whether it's worth pushing the wet and laptop to a slightly more formal sumada.
But the diversity has made shoulder bags a true love of women for summer.
For example, when you read foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that stands out is that fashionistas first go to the local market on holiday and buy themselves a few shoulder bags, which they are faithful throughout the holiday period and which go along the beach, in the market, and also in cramped with girlfriends in the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a large bunch of bags at the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting, however, that there is so much demand for bags among readers that in the real world women (and men!) would probably go out with each other to become a lucky owner of a few bags.
In some ways, this madness is understandable, because it's rare for times when you can buy yourself a few things that have become a hit show for just a few dozen euros.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple way to make money here, and so thinner luxury brands are also selling straw bags for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Apparently, for richer customers not to feel like ordinary mortals who are prospering around with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a Dolce & Gabbana with a shoulder bag costing over 1,000 euros.
But for the Chanel shoulder bag, you can go out on a round of 6,000.
Unlike most fashion designers, however, the shoulder bags don't come from some big fashion box, but their story began farther away.
The shoulder bags are said to come from far-flung Filipinos, where they have been widely weathered.
The buzz of a bag of oils is, first and foremost, an explebogaze business, and you don't see locals around them very often.
The strawbber technique is said to date back to the 14th century and is quite sarane with normal baskets.
However, because the shoulder bag doesn't have to be bumped as heavily as a basket, patterns and other materials can be sprinkled in them, making the bag more personal and, by that, more acttractive.
Recently, for example, there have been particularly trendy bags with coloured pillows or leather strips.
But the shoulder bags can be sent to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest bruized shoulder-length fan, had never seen before.
She matched her shoulder bag to all sorts of clothing and didn't think it was much to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
However, the popularity of cottens these days does not play a smaller role, however, is that caring for them is a head of fall and, unlike all sorts of mushrooms, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but also by water and wet towels.
As is the case with trendy gadots, brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations besides the classic look.
For example, you can buy a strapless linen with shoulders or a tiny shoulder bag instead.
But it's worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but it does.
But what is the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, a bag of shoulders bleached that resembles a basket of its style has been considered classic, has been considered classic, and is short, as well as straws.

GMB concerned about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union is awaiting assurances from the managers of cookie maker McVitie's long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of the Tollcross site.
More than 500 people are employed at the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products.
Pladis, owner of the company McVitie, said they had invested more than 5 million pounds in the site over the past few years.
More workers were hired, and union chairmen "is the first to hear" when something changes in the factory's operations.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's company to "democer concerns that the funding will not be used to modernise production lines."
Drew Duffy, senior GMB executive, said: "The fact that we are not getting clarity from the site's chief executive about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan is deeply worrying our members.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow, essential to ensuring decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
So Glasgow's east needs a strong-winord earnings in McVitie, against a backdrop of jobs, pay and welfare, in the face of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic decline in manufacturing."
A spokesman for Place said: "The site manager only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to it as we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between staff and GMB representatives in Tollcross, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We then discussed with the staff that, like all other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on a rolling basis - and this applies to all our companies and sites - to ensure their competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds at the Tollcross site, most of which have gone to production lines and improving operations.
We fully understand the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing site and should there be any change in the operation of the site, the workers and the trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona against approaching Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up in their quest to lure Neymar into their ranks by making an offer of 189 million pounds to buy him, but did they warn Barcelona of this record-breaking trip three years ago?
This abstinent approach has opened the summer transfer window and the Ligue 1 club are poised to break the current world record of more than double the current world record set by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
Once the transition is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, after receiving a salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week from PSG after taxes.
Barcelona are known to be angry at both the way they approached and the way Neymar broke free, although a source close to the Catalans' governing body insists the club have always looked after the best of the footballer since arriving from Santos in 2013.
But was the PSG president warning the football world of such a possibility three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned tough all clubs thinking about recruiting some of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they're going to beat any of our players, we'll come up against them and contact those players," Al-Khelaifi said.
'We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to sign a contract with some of our players, they'll have to face the consequences.'
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG have made it clear that they will not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could backfire as a result of that interest, losing one of their expensive assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit.
"Brexit is in serious danger of weddling a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," warned Varadkar during his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders," he stressed.
Varadkari said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, as it cannot, remain part of the European single market.
It would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smooth would be to create a customs union for the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish prime minister has explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "Obviously we could have this with Britain."
An alternative to this would be a return to customs points that would herald historical division and political failure.
"To trade, prosperity and peace," the Irish prime minister said.
He called Brexit a "probundle of our generation" and warned that the result could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily life.
The Irish premier met leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when they visit Belfast.
Player Avandi: The Ironman, who has completed his first half-pipe triathlon, can pass by anyone.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the winter capital, Otepää, was held in the city of Otepää, where around 1,000 triathletes from more than thirty countries took part in the semi-fit Ironman competition.
The 70.3 mile distance consisted of 1.9km of swimming, 90km of cycling and 21.1km of cycling.
Others triumphantly completed the first triathlon of their lives by Mount Avandi.
"I thought it would be difficult and in the end it was difficult," Avandi said at the finish line.
Despite the complexity, Avandi said that triathlon is actually affordable for almost everyone.
"Not a distance kills, it kills pace," he said, alluding that almost everyone will reach the finish line at a strong pace.
With the exception of Ott Sepp: "It's OK with the physique, but unfortunately he can't swim"
The Opener had been eager to train since February.
First 4-5 hours a week, but later for 10 hours a week.
In time, 05:34:12, he ranked 270th overall.
Although Avandi lost both Raio Lowry (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Lang (time 05:06:37), he won over the other so-called "prominent class."
Tanel Padar, who was a "good example" last year, lost to Avan in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (times 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tam in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18 respectively).
German Johannes Moldan was crowned the overall winner of the men's county in the Ironman series in 3:58:27, with the best Ivo Grand in 04:14:09.
Dane Helle Frederiksen won in 04:24:01, while Maria Jänese won in nearly half an hour to Frederiksen and won by 04:58:58:58.
The opening run of 1.9km of swimming was run in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in the 410th position.
