Four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Postman, Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski, was detained by the police in Spain.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also took three suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
According to the suspicion, these are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal organisation between the ages of 27 and 57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
The alleged leader of a criminal organisation was detained in Mijas, Malaga province, Spain.
Three men were detained on suspicion of murder in Estonia, one of whom is a leading figure in a criminal organisation, according to the data collected, and two are members of a criminal organisation.
The data collected indicate that the tasks and roles were clearly allocated in the criminal organisation.
The purpose of the activities of the criminal organisation was to commit drug crimes and thereby generate criminal income", commented Vahur Verte, Head of Pre-Trial Proceedings in the Criminal Case.
"We do not rule out an increase in the number of suspects in this case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been caught up in the interest of law enforcement in the past, and some of them have served sentences for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with spanish colleagues has played an important role throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation demonstrates the success of the cooperation," prosecutor Verte said.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said the detentions were preceded by a nearly year-and-a-half criminal investigation.
"In the first half of the week, the long-term work materialized and we detained those suspected of crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time," he said.
Leis added that central criminal police officers were assisting in the detention in Spain.
For years we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the civilian guard.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can reach them from the other side of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that, while at large, the men on suspicion may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor's office requested their arrest and the court approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia.
Real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized in this criminal case to secure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case are conducted by the Bureau of Organised Crime of the Central Criminal Police and managed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in estonia's criminal world after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes at various hotels and charged businessmen a monthly rooftop tax.
Joint international operations, confiscation seizures of criminal proceeds and court rulings which have entered into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court rulings, eight defendants separated from the criminal case of the so-called Dikayev criminal organisation, from whom EUR 80 000 in criminal proceeds were confiscated, or a judgment against nine persons for creating a criminal organisation in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade in cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to trafficking in human beings in Ida-Viru County and Southern Estonia.
The amount of criminal proceeds seized there is approximately EUR 71 500.
Success in these criminal cases has been ensured by police officers exchanging information and evidence with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and, if necessary, by taking action together in any eu country.
Civil rights group warns against travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri against discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
A statement from the group reads: "The NAACP travel note issued for the state of Missouri, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to be especially attentive and extremely cautious when moving around the state, given the entire series of suspicious racial-based events that have occurred across the state recently and have been highlighted here."
According to the NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning both by a recent Missouri law that makes it harder to win discrimination lawsuits, and by the fact that minorities are unevenly targeted by state law enforcement.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled to the side of the road because of the color of their skin, they are beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of the NAACP, told The Kansas City Star newspaper.
"We've never received complaints so closely before."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization for the US state.
The group cited events such as racist insults toward black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died earlier this year under suspicious circumstances after he ran out of gas while driving through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General that shows that in the state, black motorists are 75% more likely to be stopped than white ones.
"The note is intended to make people aware and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared, whether it's taking bail money or informing relatives that they're going through the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state in 16th place in the state in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also in response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for a company to sue for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel remarks about Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws requiring local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because, according to the ACLU, it increases racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have begun using this measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.
Hepatitis: what could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All these viruses provoke acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, at a malignant cost there is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can develop into liver cirrhosis, i.e. wrinkles in the liver and liver cancer.
The health board's epidemiology adviser, Kuulo Kutsar, says that the signs of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grayish stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last sign of the disease also comes from the popular name of liver inflammation jaundice.
In children, hepatitis may pass without symptoms.
Different types of liver inflammation can only be determined on the basis of data from a laboratory examination.
Acute hepatitis can transition to chronic hepatitis and progress for decades without signs of disease, which means that a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Kuulo Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from the stools of an infected person to hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, mouths and drug use.
The risk of hepatitis A infection includes family members and carers of the sick person, people with chronic liver diseases, people having sex with the infected, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular, vaccination is recommended for people who travel a lot and are at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily compliance with hygiene requirements is important: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before being consumed for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread by contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattooing, piercing, use of blood-contaminated household items (toothbrushes, shaving agents), donor blood, having sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis and having sex with a mother/newborn patient with hepatitis.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, family members and carers of the sick, health care workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travellers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B.
For the prevention of hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended that people at risk be vaccinated, as well as persons suffering from chronic liver diseases, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: refraining from using foreign hygiene and manicures, other sharps and syringe needles, tattooing and piercing, and using condoms in case of infectious sex, or avoiding sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation schedule in Estonia and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread by contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattooing, piercing, use of household items contaminated with blood, donor blood, having sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from a mother suffering from a hepatitis patient to a foetus/newborn.
The risk group at risk of hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, sex partners of an infected person, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, family members and carers of the sick, health care workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, persons infected with HIV, and travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis C.
The preventive measure for hepatitis C is: abstaining from the use, tattooing and piercing of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharp means and syringe needles, and the use of condoms for sex that is dangerous to infection.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs in combination with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread by contact with blood and other bodily fluids, syringe needles contaminated with them, sexually transmitted and rarely infected from mother to fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people with non-hepatitis B immunity.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses are spread by faecal-oral route with drinking water and food, including low-heat-treated beef, fish and seashells, donor blood, shared syringes and infected mother-to-foetus.
Travellers may become infected with hepatitis E in countries with high disease rates.
Preventive measures for hepatitis E include compliance with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Wash fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
Although the four-time Olympic champion tried to get off the track in the final lap, the 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won in 26:49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling her husband Tania and her children along the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
Being on the track with them was amazing," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for a fifth title race in London in a row in the 5,000 and 10,000-meter gold doubles.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "The Lady in Gold. The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, a portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, "the birth story of a work of art far deeper into the cultural life of vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries."
But even more thoroughly into history.
The awe-inspiring amount of information could have been used, perhaps a harder cut axe, a narrower theme would have allowed the extraordinary story of the portrait promised in the title to have more impact.
At present, it is as if there are two books between the covers: the story of Gustav Klimt and his painting "The Lady in Gold", and a much larger and more comprehensive history book about the esteemed Jewish families and the German occupation, with its after-effects in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to a vibrant Cultural Life of Vienna, and who himself ended up in the Austrian capital, one can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago life went around the Ringstrasse, or how everyone turned their heads in the Central café when Klimt walked in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see a name familiar in the book, you feel like a gram more cultured.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was operating in a city where incurable syphilis proliferated and had the highest suicide rate in Europe does not add anything to the development of the story.
Or perhaps so - every pair of brush strokes also adds colours to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten inhabitants of Vienna was Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch twice and posed for Klimt for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet didn't pull all the glamorous life she belonged to.
If you look at "Lady in Gold", it is hard to believe that towards the end of her life this magnificent lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt's order cost 4,000 kroner at the time, a quarter of the price of a well-located country house.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of having a master love story with a model did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only definite fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that emerged during the work continued for the rest of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Lady in Gold.
An extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the work began with Adele, Klimt had been to the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, and investigators believe that it was the brilliant mosaics seen there from Empress Theodora that gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Lady in Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and around the same time (1907-1908) another golden painting , "Kiss", was born.
In art historians, the similarity between the two women did not go unnoticed.
What does Hitler have to do with the story?
"I think, in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him money to make his handiwork available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had another portrait of Adele.
Also in her will (Adele left in February 1925), she asked her husband to leave his two portraits and four of Gustav Klimt's landscape paintings to the Austrian Gallery.
She bequeathed her jewelry to her nieces Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt graduated from the Mona Lisa in Austria, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to get into the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but failed in the drawing ceremony.
Although sometimes the reason for Hitler's later anti-Semitism is that he was not accepted into the academy by Jewish professors, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery referred to in Maria's will had changed considerably by 1939 - it had become important to find works that pleased the Nazi party from Vienna's rich Jewish art collections.
Some of Adele's homework was also suitable for Hitler's personal art repository, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robberies, a 10-year litigation began between the Austrian Government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauers.
It should only be noted here that if "Kiss" is seen at Belvedere Castle in Vienna, "Lady in Gold" depicting Adele Bloch-Bauer must be seen driving to New York's Neue Galerie.
And before you travel to Vienna, read the aforementioned book.
Even if you don't plan on seeing Klimt's work, because at least my emotions revolved around a Nazi and Jewish theme after the book closed for more than $135 million, and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait, but rather a family destiny story - and a very moving story.
Remarkably, the Bauer family tree mentioned at the beginning of the book facilitated the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In the prelim, Gold was very close to his personal record of 200m backstroke swimming in 2.16.62.
The top mark dates back to 17 years ago, when the Canadian Junior Championship turned 2.16.58, mediated by Priit Aavik's Swimming Blog.
Gold made it to the A-Finals last, the 10th.
In the final, he completed the distance in 2:15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a powerful new top mark.
Gold was just over half a second short of the Estonian record held by Alina Kendzior (2.15.13).
Gold came third in the Estonian all-time rankings and its latest personal top mark is Estonia's fifth all-time result.
The young forward is still in the 100m, 200m and 400m freestyle and 200m and 400m mixed swimming at the Canadian Adult Championships.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships were held in Toronto, and Gold made successful starts there as well.
He won a silver medal in the 200m freestyle in 2:03.22.
So quickly this distance was last floated by an Estonian in 2008.
Only Elina Partõka, an Estonian record woman, has swam this distance in Estonia faster than gold.
The Estonian, who lives in Canada, also won a bronze medal in the 100m freestyle with an excellent personal record and a new estonian season top mark of 56.66.
Kertu Ly Alnek, for example, a year older than him, has only swam this distance one hundredth faster.
He reached the personal top mark in the 100m backstroke by receiving a letter of 1.03.69 in the opening exchange of the theatre.
At half-time, he only achieved seventh place when he swam 2.17.31 in the final.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season rankings at four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen teeth
The holiday season is upon us - that is, relaxation for US President Donald Trump as well.
However, since Trump has been one of the presidents who has taken out one of the most vacation days so far, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
USA Today and CNN report that the president plans to spend a 17-day vacation at a self-named golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the presidential holiday began yesterday, opponents of Trump have been speaking out on the holiday for a week now.
They criticize Trump for resting too often.
Namely, the president has a habit of spending weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days in office.
George W. Bush, for example, has been on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama is half as much as Trump, just 21 days.
However, Things tend to be quickly forgotten by Trump.
Days after becoming president, Trump said on "60 Minutes" that there would be no time for long vacations during his term in office, as much needs to be done.
He also expressed outrage at Barack Obama's vacation three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is chopping off journalists" heads."
According to White House officials, the 17-day visit to the golf club is not exactly a relaxation.
Instead, it's officially called a working holiday, during which Trump has no time to read or other entertaining activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for working leave.
Namely, the air conditioning system in the West Wing of the White House will be replaced, which is why all personnel had to leave.
The Oval Office and other presidential offices are also located in the West Wing.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the West Wing in August when it's 38 degrees and there's no air conditioning," said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue to work on vacation.
You can get an idea of where President Trump will spend the next 17 days in the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook don't run for public office if you can't stand voter criticism
The father of our country knew a lot about unfavorable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start bullying him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of expression can be taken away from us, and in dumb and silent words we can be led to massacres like sheep."
That brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work harder to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU sued him for that reason.
The governor's office branded the lawsuit null and void, and online commentary was teeming with counter-reactions in the style of "Who cares?".
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But that counts.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is an astonishingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state.
His approval rating ranks second best among the state's 50 governors.
Hogan is not an unthinking responsive pussyhead.
He has led the state with a firm hand and has remained strictly committed to his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook quite skewedly as a key tool in communicating with his constituents, presenting his bald head for the first time since chemotherapy, for example.
Thus, the governor's page, which is an officially marked public forum managed by taxpayer-funded staff, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people visiting.
Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's all too easy to paint a picture of online trolls, spammers or angry people.
The Post interviewed several real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that's exactly what they are real people who communicate with their elected leaders. Teacher, business owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not at all rimble.
In his post, the pastor quoted the Bible, oppressing Hogan's Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, an attorney from Bowie, Maryland, did not incite hatred, but about real hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in a comment section of The Post's news story.
"I also dislike the idea that when a large number of people comment on the same subject, some immediately indifferently call it a collective effort, rather than admitting that they are a large number of concerned citizens."
In what the governor's office called a "targeted spam attack," others would probably call "public support."
The Facebook age allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than it used to be, when, in order to do the same, workers had to be expelled so that they could gather newspapers with critical editorials and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for biting Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have blocked him from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark court rulings on the issue was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment to the Constitution by blocking a voter from her Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for facebook and Twitter use.
It shouldn't be that hard.
Under Washington, affordable postal spending had a similar effect to the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous letter writers slammed his way of managing.
And even then, Washington had to confront anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making decisions in Washington.
According to historical documents gathered as part of an online George Washington mail collection project, his office was buried under petitions criticising his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't make them keep quiet.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty will be counting on the comfort of his home territory over the next three days when the 25th round of the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf course takes place. Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who was in charge of the last round on the neighbouring Archerfield Links trail last year before crashing to Paul Eales, is fond of the new venue and will fill the role of tournament ambassador in place of the club's founder and chief executive Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and now we're seeing the club shine in full glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players see the track at their best, it's in brilliant condition.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He is an avid supporter of the game of golf and is proud of what he has achieved here.
This allows the track to be perfectly presented."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a very special feeling," said the southport player.
"I couldn't defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off the race calendar a year after my victory.
It's magical to come back to this neighborhood.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories from last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always carry in our hearts."
Gary Orr, who joined the Mushroom European Tour earlier this year when he turned 50, will also return to competition on home soil.
It is his first event in Scotland since taking part in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It's always a little bit more meaningful to play at home," helensburgh man Orr said.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel extra stress.
I've enjoyed playing again and shown some pretty decent golf.
I'm happy with the way things have been done so far."
The trio will be joined on the field by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots in the competition fire, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free and car parking costs £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds go to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold-plated land
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
He even rarely uses the pot.
In a wooden cottage in Enarotal, the regent's capital of the Paniai region of Indonesia's reluctant Papua province, the housewife places a batade called nota in the local language directly on the fire place.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is taken from the fire and eagerly tucked into the skin with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the muddy floor with no furniture, and there she also does her daily household chores, for example, washing laundry with cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
The role of the walkway is performed by a bucket in a room without a roof.
Since she is the youngest of her husband's four wives, she is not destined to take care of any field.
Polygamy is common here.
However, working late can be dangerous most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, plus there are soldiers here.
"No one dares visit after 5:00 a.m.," he says.
It's a rare glimpse into life in the Papua Highlands. It is a former Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elderly people were forced to vote in front of the occupying forces.
The movement, which has fuelled the liberation of the Dutch from domination, quickly channelled its rage against the Government of Jakarta, which continues to keep the region under strong control, keeping away foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, so that independent Papua New Guinea remained the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is both a remote and an abandoned place. To get here, you need to fly 90 minutes from the provincial capital, Jayupuri, to Nabire and then take a five-hour journey in a rental car.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered with wavy iron roofs, the rust of which has turned yellowish-brown in different shades.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, nor have foreigners been here at all.
Before the arrival of christian missionaries, the Peacocks of Mee Pago worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing clothes like this," says Degei, referring to her colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse and bright skirt.
"Before that, we only wore plant leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of people living below the poverty line, and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are among the worst in Asia.
But it is also indonesia's gold-plated land.
Just 100 km from Paniai, a mountainous province about the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000, grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, is owned by Phoenix-based company Freeport McMoran.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua can boast of stocks of commercial wood, estimated to be worth USD 78 billion.
But these riches are a source of suffering for the peacocks, as they necessitate the suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian military.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freeport paid local military personnel and military units approximately USD 20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150,000 per officer.
The Papules' efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are ruthlessly handled.
Human rights activists say more than 500,000 peacocks have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killing in the Highlands belonging to papua tribes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
The 2016 report "We will lose everything" by the Archdiocese of Birsbane includes testimony about atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (rape and electric shocks are particularly common, according to another report) and a brutal crackdown on peaceful protests.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, because such incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws are even harder to turn off because Papua's natural resources have caused an influx of newcomers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's crowded islands of Java, Kalimantani, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Java's family canteens sell gado-gado with crispy and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papuas," explains 24-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to the provincial capital, Jayapua, for work.
"Indigenous Papua Papua mama-mama [women] are losing market share as a result."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, pledged in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights abuses in Papua.
The former carpenter won 27 of Papua's 29 constituencies, including Paniai, on his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But very little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in anticipation that he would live up to our hopes of restoring justice," you say.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai was struggling.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children were singing Christmas carols at a campfire in Eerotal when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from darkness.
Horrified children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to yavedt Tebai, a local pastor, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, intoxicated soldiers chased the children and beat them with their rifle handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby Electoral Commission building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated further.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of a local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting jackets and performed a waita dance by the Papua Honey Pago tribe, during which they ran around and imitated a bird song.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military personnel.
As the outcry escalated, the soldiers were ordered via internal radio. "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them," the official document said, seen by TIME magazine but not released to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, a elder in the Kego Koto district of Enarotal, felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained, asking the crowd to go home.
Nobody wanted to listen.
"Turning around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine, in his bright colors on the veranda of a treehouse.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There were a lot of people, a lot of shots," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to a cousin who witnessed his shooting.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who uses only one name in the manner of many Indonesians, told TIME magazine.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only ensured the safety of his station because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if we are threatened with killing," Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papua police, said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and scores injured.
News of the killings didn't arrive in Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapua, where he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to address the abuses in Papua.
"I want to resolve this case now so it never happens again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would put in place an out-of-court mechanism to deal with crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately, apologies followed.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes," he said.
However, speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto retracted his words, saying he had no intention of setting up a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, "everything will be resolved by law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said 11 crimes against human rights had already been solved in Papua, including what happened in Paniai.
The families of Paniai's victims accepted such claims with grim disbelief.
"I've been interrogated four times in the last three years, but there's been no progress," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the army is arresting me, I'm afraid I'm going to get shot."
His brother, Yacobus, confirmed that the people of Paniai were afraid to dissect the incident.
He said he was beaten by the army after helping to bury four victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighboring region of Paniai, Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when a row broke out between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to transport an unconscious man to a hospital.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company's office on the construction site.
According to police, the villagers threw stones at the policemen, on which the latter responded with warning shots.
But according to locals, the mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, afraid of retribution," Dominggu Badii, a 29-year-old who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being checked in, told TIME magazine.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
Deiyai's parliament has called for the officers involved to be prosecuted and for the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds on the discontent of the honey, moni, dan and damal tribes living in papua's hapless central mountainous land.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) rebel army, which it says protects the rights of peacocks by carrying out occasional attacks and kidnapping raids among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL's leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of "defending the sovereignty of the state", the military has arrested Paniais in recent years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Pania is known as a "tragic forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People grow all their food themselves mainly batate, in addition to a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom is able to maintain four or five battalion fields.
They usually keep most of the crop for the family, the rest sell on the local market.
Ten batters cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between indigenous boats and new migrants, who have arrived at Nabire Airport since the opening of new routes, have deepened.
The few jobs that exist go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuas themselves often lack the capital or the necessary skills to do competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, there are severe restrictions on foreign media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua for "failing to follow relevant practices", although they had been granted a rare filming licence.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division, Jokowi's election promises to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"Journalists attempting to report from Papua's most eastern troubled provinces and West Papua in Indonesia are facing new threats of visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a drilling eye on the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations, Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of large-scale crimes" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These same countries have historically also supported VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has democratic order and freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of anti-human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When the official Dutch delegation, headed by the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Bar, visited Jaypura on May 4, local people broke their silence, according to a source who was present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous, urging: "We want freedom."
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but the Peacocks do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants to make it clear to Jokowi that, in addition to constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, the people of Paniai are suffering from misery because of poor education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, like other peacocks, consider their vote to Jokowi to be the debt he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the paniai shooting victims were able to cope with one last symbolic insurgent by burying the body of one of the victims on land opposite a police station and a military base.
Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," yacobus says with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire swallows Dubai Torch skyscraper for second time
The fire swept through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire to have devastated a high-rise building in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch, or Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no immediate cause of the fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up to a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," one resident, who called himself George, told Reuters.
According to Dubai Civil Defense officials, firefighters extinguished the flames at about 4 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to shelter the victims.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation conducted by the Torch Board in the aftermath of the 2015 fire found that facades - decorative panels and insulation of the exterior surface - suffered the most damage.
British police have said they believe the insulation and façade panels at Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that broke out there in June, in which around 80 people died.
Watch: These phones are likely to be sold in the fall
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then phone manufacturers will unveil their new top models.
In the spring, the Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came on sale, and new hit phones are also expected for the store counters in the fall.
According to Kristjan Seema, Tele2's director of marketing and sales, this year's flagships are characterized by innovative design, eye liner scanner, edge-to-edge 4K resolution screen and ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the top of the Estonian smartphone sales rankings, generated great excitement in the world of technology.
Autumn promises even more agile fast charging, a more durable battery, a higher quality camera and greater water and dust resistance for smart enthusiasts.
He added that rumours suggest that four top models are likely to conquer this year's sales rankings.
These four top smartphone models will hit the store counters later this autumn.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to hit the store counters as early as mid-September.
Rumours of what the new Apple model will look like and what it might do with it are spreading a lot.
While the iPhone 7 didn't bring significant differences alongside the iPhone 6s, apple's 10th birthday is expected to be completely different from the previous ones.
Four colors have been talked about: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost, and the fingerprint reader is built inside the screen.
JonyIve, Apple's head of design, insists that the new iPhone model looks like smooth glass.
There has also been talk of a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to an eye-watering scanner, wireless charging and an even higher-quality camera, you can expect a faster A11 processor.
It's definitely one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-ordering for the brand new model Galaxy Note 8 starts on August 23.
There have been many rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
I hear it's meant to be even more business user, and S Pen allows for even more functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle and the other a tv lens with a narrower field of view.
At the moment, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of yet, but in any case this is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
However, we look forward to August 23rd.
Although Nokia has launched three smartphones this year, led by the Nokia 6, their flagship - the Nokia 8, which will be unveiled as early as August 16 - is still missing.
We expect a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge display from Nokia and an ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminum housing and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras, the optics of which are produced by the company Zeiss.
While Sony's solid flagship has so far been the XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future, with even more innovative features.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but with at least the same good or better camera.
There has been speculation about Sony's new model that its screen will be at least six inches.
What the reality is, we will be able to see very soon, because traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flagship at the international technology fair IFA, which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for border wall
The Washington Post published transcripts of phone calls between Us President Donald Trump and mexican and Australian leaders.
On January 27, Trump made a phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly declaring that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president cracked down on him for publicly denouncing the wall, saying, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump built his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts were also published of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull revealing a tense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take in refugees bound for Australia was "ridiculous," "lousy" and "stupid." He argued that a deal made during the Obama administration would give him the impression of a "dread" because he has proposed a ban on resettling refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the speech by telling Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not hear the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in a case in which the City of Tartu rejected their bid for the procurement of bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is an order rejecting the offer of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in tartu bus procurement because the tender did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, Head of the Legal Service of Tartu City Government.
This is a procurement of public bus services within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Liinid appealed to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not hear it.
While many on social media complain that the noise coming out of the Weekend festival is disrupting their nightlife and the whole city is full of drunken partygoers, there are plenty of people who don't have a bad word to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the festivities in the store were so polite!
I didn't see any blurry or rudeness.
I even saw kindness," says Laine.
"It's nice to come, be and enjoy Pärnu, which is like hibernation in winter," he adds cheerfully.
The gruesome Laine coming from the beach doesn't interfere with her sleep.
If, while living downtown, he still heard music playing on the beach, now the music hasn't reached the walls of his home yet.
"But I hope I do," he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who also spoke to the Evening Standard, says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu – it contributes greatly to the turnover of local merchants.
In addition, he is glad that so many outlandlands have come to visit the summer capital.
The party-goers don't bother the woman.
Even though I don't sunbathe on the beach anymore, it's nice that the beach has been vibrant.
And it's nice that people are moving and that's been the case three times," she says.
The first time, I think it was a little worse.
"Then maybe there were complaints," he ponders.
However, what is happening on the beach is, he says, common place for summer ers.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," says Harri, who is partying in the park.
Melu and the roar haven't punched his rhythm of life into the oscillation either.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interethrate communication would be better.
Loud music doesn't kill a man.
It doesn't interfere, even though I live right there nearby.
"Good people can stick together and there's no trouble," he says.
The guests who came to Pärnu are polite, he said.
"They've exaggerated the bottles a little bit, of course, but young people are young and god - give it a go, but be human and we'll be fine!" he says.
Beachfront residents have been traveling away from somewhere by then, either to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life – people like such a life", says Tiina, who has walked with children in Pärnu.
His family's sleep is not disturbed by festival music either, although last year it went even further than this year.
Last summer, the stage was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live out of town ourselves, that it actually sounds pretty good to the far Pärnu River," he says.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
British education company Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent, triggering another restructuring programme to tackle the business's looming squeeze.
The jobs to be lost, which chief executive John Fallon said were likely to be made redundant in late 2018 and early 2019, will add to the 4,000 jobs lost in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced plans in May to cut costs by a further 300 million pounds (394 million U.S. dollars) as part of a third cost-cutting program to try to revive a business that has been hit by a rapid digital switchover.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann, said their expectations for the year had not changed after announcing a 1 per cent increase in sales to £2.05billion in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, according to officials.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest in a series of acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque attack in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "man-made self-made explosive device."
According to the statement, all of the injured are in stable condition and are being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the growing power of the Taliban and the group, known as the Islamic State (ISIS), is a serious source of concern for NATO forces in Qarabagh.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people in the mainly Shiite district.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bombattack killed more than 150 people in the city center - the highest number of deaths in the country since U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
This violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while Us President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country's military and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to defer smog order after lawsuits
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay the obama-era regulation requiring states to limit emissions from smog, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced the decision to resume "2015 ozone-determination operations" late Wednesday, saying it demonstrates the agency's commitment to working with states.
"We believe we need to engage in dialogue and listen to our state partners," EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced the EPA's intention in June to delay ozone concentrations in different parts of the country to determine where it should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to meet a stricter air quality standard.
Fifteen predominantly Democratic states filed a lawsuit tuesday with the District of Columbia, saying the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama. Trump says it's part of a broader plan to boost economic growth.
But those efforts have provoked reactions among Democrats and conservation groups concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA's website states that inhaling ozone-containing air "can reduce the ability of the lungs to work and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases" such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a feast as heavy rains threaten the harvest of the European Union's second-largest wheat producer, writes Bloomberg.
This year it may be that weeks of rainfall before harvest may mean that fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for feeding animals.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeien.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can go for animal feed, double the usual, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First of all, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June was replaced by a heatwave.
In July, Germany was hit by seizures, which have continued in August.
The eyes of many are turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area has n't even started harvesting yet, reported local harvest buyer Ceravis.
"These are pretty difficult days," said Ceravis senior trader Frank Deckert of Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything, i.e. clever swings of Finns' interior design
Beautiful nature plays a role in the interiors of exhibition homes, as through large windows the magnificent views of the shores of Saimaa reach many (life) rooms.
Every step of the way, the aspiration of our northern neighbours to create both crisp and perfect (energy-saving) homes stands out.
It is worth admiring and also following the skills of Finns to use wood as a construction and finishing material, in the manufacture of furniture and beauty items.
Exhilarating techniques and smart solutions can be found in the fair houses by both the builder and the (home) designer.
There it is vividly pointed out that the shades of black, white and gray, if complemented by wood tones and houseplants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked for another week, as the fair runs until 13 August.
Accessories and herb pots suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
On the night of today, the line was drawn for this year's Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix did his best on the main stage to remember the last performer.
The crowd was really in a frenzy during Garrix's performance - singing, hugging, dancing self-depreviously.
When Garrix graduated, the common mass was scattered from Pärnu Beach to the city.
Let's bring you a gallery with all the pictures our photographer captured on Weekend in three days.
I'm sure you're in some of them, too, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to be on a collision course to face each other in the most engaging boxing match of the near future in the weight category of up to 66.7kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in espn's office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization featherweight champion.
Following Garcia's unanimous decision victory over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Showtime on Saturday, both fighters are in the top of the weight ing list.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be "the perfect measure."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up [to 63.5kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small at 63.5 kg.
I want to move below lightweight.
And he has to move up the lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
That's what the fans have wanted.
Let us offer them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether there should be a fee to watch it. It's part of his strategy of letting Lomachenko debut in the 61.2kg class later this year to make a possible meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 beak) next summer, who also has an interest in fighting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their lightweight title race at forum on September 23.
"Watching this fight could be paid because the fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said later, saying he was open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We are the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "great fighter" and could go and watch his match on Saturday.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; Sorry, Mikey... you wanted that beak".
Garcia said the goal was to show the strength of the shot and then boxing.
Both confirmed that they feel the tension between them is growing.
"This is a fight waiting to be realized.
No other confrontation generates so much attention and buzz.
I'm more than willing to work for it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It's going to be a good fight."
From which corners of the world will estonia move?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued a record 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
While last year, for example, it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6 702 foreigners, the figure was 4 928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually stay permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis is being prepared by the Ministry of The Interior.
While ten years ago nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia per year, in recent years this figure is getting close to 2,000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased exponentially during the Ukraine crisis - in 2014, 1,087 people obtained temporary residence permits, compared with 675 a year earlier.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing the most in Estonia – last year, 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and due to the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought in a country where the community and many families are already ahead of them," said Kristin Rammus, a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior.
Last year and last year, the number of Ukrainians who obtained temporary residence permits was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in 10 years the total number of temporary residence permits has been issued to the latter.
While Ukrainians come here predominantly to work, Russian citizens are worried about family migration.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the greatest family ties to people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the Academy of Internal Defense.
"If you look at where the Russian citizens who have obtained estonian residence permits have gone to live, after Harju County it is immediately Ida-Viru maa", he added, and pointed out that about 40 per cent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1,696 Russian citizens obtained temporary residence permits, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to renew their residence permits decreased.
"The jump is due to the fact that instead of renewing the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for for permanent entry into Estonia", explained Rammus, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in estonian residence permits has remained rather stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years from last year can apply for a new residence permit to settle permanently in Estonia.
It aims to encourage adapted people to stay here.
However, a long-term resident's residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has also apparently decreased because of the new residence permit.
Last year, for example, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Now Ukrainians can change jobs, and the Estonian state is no longer pointing the finger at whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit became popular in a blow - applicants last year were still holders of grey passports (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1,968 people, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese, obtained residence permits to settle in Estonia.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In 10 years, surprisingly, Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are some of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
While three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, in 2009, 200 were issued to Nigerians.
From Nigeria, they come to study at the universities here.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular with Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely due to mobility.
They, too, are subject to the rule that where the community has emerged, there will be more," Rammus added.
In 10 years, two people have also moved to Estonia from, for example, North Korea, the same number from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
While about 6,000 third-country nationals receive residence permits each year, that's about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if you include the citizens of the European Union, migration is around a percentage point', Maasing commented that the figures are actually low.
In total, according to Statistics Estonia, 14,822 people migrated to Estonia last year, compared with 13,792.
This means that immigration exceeded emigration for the second year in a row.
Most of the emigrants and entrants are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among the leavers.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was minus 2,000 people last year.
Estonians travel primarily between Finland and Estonia.
Maammu Couture's princess imood fascinates with sats, embroidery and tulle
The bottomless box of ideas, however, is history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream somewhere in the museum for hours and admire the old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
When you do something with passion, you study and learn more about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
Mammoth Couture's glamorous world may seem alien to some, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much shine there is in your life!
I have a girlfriend with a whole sauna full of haute couture dresses I've created.
Because it's not her fault she doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go to the red carpet every day, she wants to wear those most beautiful dresses, too, and she does!
You can make your own life special!
The fashion designer does not acknowledge the gap between shining events and grey everyday life.
It was this reasoning that led to the plan to bring high fashion to the countryside, between forests and fields in Estonia, to people that fashion often does not reach.
The mammoth collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion allied, where a royal defilee with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, poses are often taken in, nodded with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - shouting bravo, standing up, wanting to thank you hand in hand.
A lot of the audience just came to the news, but now they're Mammoth Couture fans.
When you exceed people's expectations, they're thrilled!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my fashion design.
In Pärnu, we had a 50-metre-long red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful dresses, it seemed like they weren't coming to an end!
Maria also doesn't admit to fashionable that the creation must be presented to a supersale supermodel, she's happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they have always been happy to come.
It's such a freak experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry I've never seen my own show, i'm always backstage giving things one last grind as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve wouldn't allow me to stand still in the hall.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who doesn't just want to play a representative role, but to be hand-in-hand in everything.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I carry out myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I'm never far from my creation, and I'm not afraid of work.
It is not limited to design, also stylistics, logistics, organization, organization - everything must fit into the day of one temperamental woman.
I guess these hours are going to be huge for the fanatics.
I can't tell you when my work day ends, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an incessant chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
Many times it's been said that there's magic in my dresses - they make me feel like a princess.
The abundant tulle sats that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained Maammo Couture's signature to this day.
Martin Waller of the U18 boys: Estonians subgroup tournament weapon turned against us now
Sorry, the fairy tale ran out.
The first thing that stood out was that we couldn't reach our table.
And when such a big gap comes in at the table, there is nothing to do", commented Martin Müürsepp, the only basketball player to play in the NBA, BC Kalev/Cramo, in the 61:75 downfall of estonian U18 basketball boys.
Opponents took 28 balls from the offensive board and received so many more attacks as a result.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defense or attack either, it created.
A lot of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build a defense.
In defence, however, they could hold hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
It knocked the team off its feet.
Opponents' homework was better done.
According to Wallepa, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to slow down the momentum of its opponents.
In the last quarter - we had zero fouls, but opponents have already scored several quick baskets.
Athleticism and tight ness, which was our weapon in the sub-group tournament, turned everything against us now.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
The masonry was satisfied with his ward in Kalevi, Matthias Tassi.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, to this day there was a uniform punching fist.
It's a pity you've met such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup has always been confident and played its way today, but it seemed that he was tired - he has carried a pretty heavy burden.
But he made some pretty nice moves I've seen in practice before," the instructor added.
Terrible numbers: The women's basketball team scored less than 10 points in three quarters of the EM tournament...
In the U18 age bracket, it is not only the young men's EM B-division basketball tournament in Tallinn that started the day before in Dublin.
And Estonia's game with Poland, unfortunately, tended to be an area of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but it was still 9:49 after the third quarter, i.e. it was only in the last ten minutes that opponents took their foot off the accelerator and that period was tied at 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4 points, 1 point in the third...
In doing so, the Estonians first hit two of the first four throws in two minutes, then 25 overs past the game, then one in three and then 21 more throws.
Perhaps in almost half an hour, one of the 47 throws was caught.
In addition, two points came from four free throws.
There was a reasonable number of ball losses in that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had 33 per cent and Estonia 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia have started with two losses, and on the opening day it was to acknowledge portugal's superiority at 83:56.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO's 1st Permanent Mine Control Group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit over the weekend to replenish ship supplies and prepare for upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the vessels will prepare for their return to the sea, while giving crew members the opportunity to take a few days' rest.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to conduct a series of exercises and be ready for future operations to search for historic explosive devices.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the co-operation training they conduct in local waters illustrates our integration with allied forces well," said Captain Arto Reinmaa, Commander of the Operations and Planning Division, which is in charge of the Navy's fleet commander.
As of June 29, Nato's 1st Permanent Mine Control Group will be led by Latvian Marine Lieutenant General Gvido Laudups, who took over the role of group commander from Estonian Naval Officer Lieutenant Johan-Elias Seljamaa at a ceremony in Riga.
The latvian naval support vessel LVNS Virsaitis has been designated as the group's flagship vessel, which also operates the group's command staff.
This semester, the international unit also includes the Estonian Navy's mine hunter Sakala.
As one of the four groups of vessels under NATO's maritime command, NATO's 1st Permanent Mine Control Group is a ready-made unit of primary rapid responders that the alliance can deploy to different parts of the world within five days.
4th - 13th of August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Monastery will once again become the place where the Birgitta Festival, brought to life by the maestro Eri Klasi 13 years ago, will be held.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Risto Joost, artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic (36).
Risto Joost: Listeners will be reached by the opera world classics "Traviata" and "Tosca", ballet performances from the enchanting "Bolero" to the fun "Karlsson", and there will also be no lack of self-production, this time a production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratory "Seasons" by the same international creative team who brought Haydn to the stage in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatrical productions.
It's bigger than any musical theatre in its usual form.
It's a festival whose fascination takes over and never quite lets go again.
Because the experience that the listener receives in this subvasive and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touches human perceptions in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't maestro Eri Klasi's shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it's been very helpful.
He guided me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of my conducting career.
Maybe it's because of that that it's easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it's all passed on to me.
It was great to join a team that knows exactly how things work.
It was the big heart of Eri Klasi that also gave me the strength to thrive with the Birgitta Festival at the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can handle it!
What could excite the audience at this year's festival, what special do you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, by the way, the first ballet written on Astrid Lindgren's narrative comes to the presentation.
It's "Karlsson flies."
And one notorious nuance in this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Yuris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this work.
Apparently, he's had karlsson's character who's been living in his soul since he was a kid.
Risto, how are you going to do all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, for sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and fortunately I have it in a pile.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions don't depend so much on other people as on myself, how I'm going to go against every new day.
And this kind of conscious tone, keeping positivity and actually smiling at myself in the morning mirror significantly increased my happiness percentage.
Especially now this week, when the most important samples are, I have been particularly eager to practice it and it will work.
Smiling at yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a buzzword.
I don't think people know half the things about their bodies that the universe offers them yet, but everyone discovers it slowly.
Right now, it's a big moment.
Do you have any kind of ritual before you step on the conductor's remote?
It is, clothes need to be replaced for more comfortable ones.
It's that little moment for yourself.
But generally, yes, I don't have a chance to rest or take a little nap before a big performance.
In fact, I even like to actively communicate with people, even before stepping into the conductor's remote.
But come all the way to the Birgitta Festival, here's what to discover for a not-so-big friend of opera and ballet!
Watch the moody video with Risto Joost!
New results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers published
In Sweden, a test was carried out among asylum seekers, during which their age was assessed medically with a novel approach. The latest results from the test show that more than 80 per cent of those tested were rated older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
Sweden's National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
The tests were set up to further assess age during asylum applications after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of several allegedly underage refugees.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has released a total of 2,481 test results between mid-March 2017 and July 31.
Eighty percent (2002) were rated as 18 years or older, and in 25 other cases, the Institute of Forensic Medicine estimated that the test "could be 18 years of age or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person was "probably younger than 18".
Tests are used only if a person's age is in question.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent compared to in previous months.
"We don't see much difference from the statistics of previous months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told The Local newspaper.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were estimated to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The institute issued the results of 581 tests in May and said that in 442 cases "there are indications that the person being investigated is 18 years of age or older."
But when the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases a person had directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI from knee joints are taken, after which they are allowed to be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include assessing the biological maturity of people to determine whether they underwent puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he told The Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, the risk of inaccurate adulthood of a child is low.
The highest risk, i.e. at about 10%, is if the person is just under 18."

Anna Maria Orel, a 20-year-old hammer thrower, made a beautiful debut at the London MM, gaining a good 18th place in 67.37.
Orel was MM's youngest female hammer thrower, and the cheerful woman confirmed that she hoped to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I had a good experience.
With the first attempt (64.80), I immediately did my average result, in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," Orel said after the race.
I was looking for my cast, and I'm really glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's MM debut ended in a good 18th place.
The rain didn't bother Orel because he's training through the winter at TUT Stadium.
"I'm tempered," he said with a little bump.
London's Olympic Stadium had an almost full house of people, did Orel perceive people around him or could he shut himself down?
I sensed, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it adds up - that's it!
If you compete yourself, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he would be satisfied with mm's debut and there are still many good races ahead of him: "I came here with the 32nd or final result of this season, I finished in 18th place.
This is a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and MM- that's all that matters.
I'm going to bring a good experience, and some days I want to compete for medals.
West Virginia governor announces party change
West Virginia's Democrat governor, Jim Justice, announced at a rally Thursday night with President Trump that he would change parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I say to you, having prayed and thought a lot... today I say to you West Virginians that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor."
Cheers erupted at the rally.
"So I'm going to be a Republican tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had earlier promised a major announcement at a west Virginia rally.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and the coal business inherited him from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee (RNC) released a statement Thursday night saying that "Governor Justice's party exchange is another blow to the Democratic Party that would rather prevent the country from getting better again than work for it."
"With just 15 governorships and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is just the most recent rejection for a party that is run from end to end and can't find a positive and unifying message," RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
It's no surprise that where there's a lot of people, there's a lot of injured people.
Urmet, who is in the medical tent at Weekend, told the Evening Standard yesterday that they had had to hand out quite a lot of patches.
Blisters and bruises are basic, twisting out and light falls.
Of course, head, back and leg pains.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes, and that's how the problems come.
Medics have also had to assist visitors with a couple of major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and one leg fracture.
We have also done stitches when a person has broken an arm or finger.
We'll do the smaller stitches here, we'll send the bigger ones to the hospital.

Coe praised the Russians' honest apology over the doping scandal
Athletics international nose man Sebastian Coe praised what he said was "Russia's honest apology on Thursday" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country back into the sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, the nose man of Russian athletics, said at the IAAF congress on the eve of the Athletics World Championships that the ban on competition imposed on his country was correct and that he had a firm aim of combating doping.
He apologised to "all the athletes who have been snatched gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban on competition imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today it was a very honest response, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian federation itself acknowledged that they have had quite a difficult time and are doing everything possible to restructure the alliance."
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its reinstatement.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the working group's proposal that now is not the time to withdraw Russia," Coe said.
"We must do everything possible in the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the IAAF's strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF working group, said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet several reinstatement criteria.
Following a presentation to the IAAF council, he told reporters in London that doping control was still inadequate and that banned coaches were still operating freely.
The revolution in electric cars significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
Not only does the electric car revolution significantly change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metals market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say that in one place they win and lose from another, smaller mining companies don't help.
Glencore currently makes money from coal and oil, but in the era of electric cars, demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will grow.
This year, the stakes for the spread of electric cars have been boosted by decisions by the governments of the UK, France and Norway, which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming years.
That's why Volvo has already announced that they plan to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla is launching a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts that for two decades electric cars will be sold more than cars using oil-produced fuels.
"For some metals, it changes everything," Simona Gambranini, commodity analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has been growing for years.
Electric cars have about three times as much copper as conventional cars, Glencore reported.
Even more copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that this will increase copper demand by about five per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will benefit from a growing electric car trend from rising copper prices and being the world's largest cobalt producer, Jefferies Group predicted.
According to this brokerage firm, the other winners of the electric car triumph are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, cobalt on the London Metal Exchange has risen by 70 per cent.
Last year's price increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also risen 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's stock rose 20 per cent in London after surpassing rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losing side are lead companies like Recyclex and Campine, which need to adapt to a new era.
The main end use of lead is batteries powered by starters for petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless another purpose is found that could overcome the decline in demand," said Michael Widmer, head of metals market analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
In the form of lead price movements, the impact of the unfolding trend has not yet been noticed.
Lead has risen 17 per cent this year, making it the best metal in London on the rise in prices for major industrial metals.
Investors see problems with metals only in the distant future.
"I'm not sure it's that bad for lead because cheap oil keeps conventional cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, head of sales at metals brokerage firm Triland Metals.
When demand for lead falls, it occurs slowly.
Maybe that's what's going to happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, tougher emission standards mean that demand for hybrid cars, which depend on lead-based batteries developed during frequent engine start-ups, will be assessed by the International Lead and Zinc Research Organization.
Light metals such as aluminum replace steel, as a lighter car can drive farther with less electricity.
This explains the additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand for 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 per cent of the world's total aluminium production.
The trend is likely to get worse, Widmer said.
Aluminium has risen 13 percent this year as growing demand from automakers has led to a market deficit.
Steel makers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce miracle car hulls.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop lighter alloy steel to withstand the aluminum.
"Super-strong steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was used as catalysts for diesel cars, metal refiner Johnson Matthey reported.
"Many raw materials currently in high demand, such as oil and platinum, may not have high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, commodities analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe there is continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, head of Uncore, said more hybrid cars will continue to be sold in 2025 than all-electric cars.
The great hope of platinum manufacturers in the 10-year perspective is the development of Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos on hydrogen cell-based cars that rely on platinum to generate electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not yet commercially justified itself.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars," said Exane BNP of Paribas, Brunet.
German carmakers suffered a major setback in July when a court in Stuttgart banned the use of diesel in the hometowns of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing european football clubs from spending unbridledly do not prevent Neymar's world-record move from Spanish football club Barcelona to French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that governs the European game and which has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, await Paris Saint-Germain.
UEFA's Fair Play Financial Rules (FFP) in 2011 mean psg will have to prove at some point that Neymar's transfer was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract alone, and Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to cash in on recruiting Neymar and adding to their star-slinging line-up, given that the team is funded by Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to get out of the football business.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into heavy debt in their quest for success would actually engage in cheating and risk ruin if banks or owners were to give up support.
Since 2011, FFP has focused on monitoring their losses instead of the debts of clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then spending heavily to improve the team and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
During FFP's current three-year assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can suffer losses of up to €30 million.
And despite Platini being ousted from the disgraced presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Alexander Ceferin remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid neymar for the buy-over clause as a single full disbursement, they are able to split that amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, making it possible to show a transitional fee of €44.4 million over the next five years.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, were hit hardest by penalties.
PSG were fined €60 million ($82 million at the time), which was later reduced to €20 million, and the club were required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players instead of the usual 25 during the 2014-15 season.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to outdo the financial institutions that regulate them by blowing up their income through companies linked to the club's owners.
Qatar's company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be counted as official income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority's PSG grant had been blown up.
It has been said that some of Neymar's PSG service could come from Qatar through payments from the 2022 World Cup organising committee.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become a World Cup ambassador and argue that UEFA regulators could easily reveal such a manoeuvre.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean uefa will be even more vigilant in any attempt to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not proactively discussed Neymar's transfer with PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss PSG's situation.
The most recently published reports show that PSG made a profit of more than EUR 10 million in the 2015-16 season at a turnover of approximately EUR 542,4 million.
Data for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
PSG hope Neymar's arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship deals, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects turnover to increase by at least 30 per cent in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to block Neymar's transfer by claiming PSG were violating the FFP.
"This is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the country," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to PSG's mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports magnate, shares La Liga's stance that the country is funding the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the state may have other ways or other interests for such a great player to represent the country."

Today 50 years ago: a hurricane-sized storm in Estonia that tore roofs and windows from houses.
The storm of the century, which roared on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage, in particular to the West Country, Harju County and Rapla County.
In north-west Estonia, the wind speed during these days was more than 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one curved tree in the garden to another and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was dark and raging, like the end of the world.
Roofs were already flying from houses in Taama, recalled old lady Linda Kurova from Haapsalu in 2002 in an interview with Estonian Nature magazine.
Linda's husband saw his own planted garden collapse.
But what do you support the trees with your hands, where do you get against a storm like this?
The sea came under the window, water splashed through the windows," Ms Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu, said at the time.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the train station apron had flown 20-30 meters away, Linda saw most haapsalu only the next morning.
According to locals, the trees behind Paralepa were on the ground, some completely down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through beautiful old trees with ragina and pragina like war.
West Viru County was not particularly badly affected in the August 1967 storm compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was also great there, the Virumaa Journal wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were swept off the ground, but the parks in our area were also badly damaged.
In Tallinn, wind speeds were measured at up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
On the evening of 6 August in Tallinn's Merivälja, a tiny girl had shouted, "Mom, Mom!
Chickens are in the air and can no longer get down!"" wrote the Virumaa Journal.
The building of Põlli Manor in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm to such an extent that it was decided to demolish it later.
The August storm was not withstandd by the constructions of the Türi ski jump mountain, which were not subsequently restored.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star newspaper wrote that the harvesting of towns and settlements from fallen trees and their branches was progressing slowly, and that residents could participate in the clean-up work.
Fruit fields were also badly affected by the storm, and the newspaper reported that "party organisations must be inspirations and guides in both rehabilitation and harvesting."
Hurricanes can be talked about if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record for gusty winds in Estonia remains from 2 November 1969, when ruhnul measured wind speeds of 48 m/s.
A gauge broke on Vaindloo Island, so the strong wind speed measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean bathing areas: night cleaning and poor beach weather
Colder summer weather also means less harvesting in Tallinn's bathing areas.
"When it's weather, people are on the beach, and if they're not, there's no people," says the beach cleaner.
Seagulls screaming at Stroom Beach in North Tallinn.
They are offered a melodic competition by a tractor bouncing at low turns, ploughing stripes down on the patch.
In fact, the latter sifts through the sand from a depth of seven centimeters, picking out sea debris and rice left behind by humans: bottle caps, cigarette butts and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If it's nice weather, then people are on the beach, and if they aren't, there are no people", says Aleksandr Usov, head of cleaning at Haabersti Haldus beach.
It's 6:30 a.m., and there's a bitter clean-up on the beach, because at 8:00, the place has to be fine for people.
Usov's at work since 4:00.
Besides Stroom, he keeps an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakari Beach.
The amount of rubbish has decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
People can already appreciate what is being done for them" says Usov, who has been cleaning up the beaches for 15 years.
It used to be that when something new was put up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're holding what's on the beach.
The price of a clean beach
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is the cleaning of marine litter, or adru, washed ashore.
On Pirita Beach, for example, 400 000 tonnes have to be transported over the beach season.
"This is an incredible amount", notes Usov.
Another big category is household garbage, which is all that people leave behind.
The one-and-a-half-kilometre Stroom beach strip has eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
That's how much garbage comes from.
However, colder summer weather has meant that garbage is a fifth less than it would otherwise be.
The third species is formed by abandoned things.
Most often they are children's sluds.
As a prey this time, Usov has scooped a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They will wait for the owners on the wooden way leading to the beach.
"Usually more of them come out, but that's a normal catch." Usov already knows that soon he will find them again in the sand.
The kids come to the beach and take the toys to drown them in the sand again.
Rubbish is scattered
Erika Scholler, a spokeswoman for Haabersti Administrative Services, concedes that locals are disturbed by the tractor screening.
The noise, which lasts from night hours to early morning, interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
During the day, however, this work is impossible.
In one month, the beach must be sifted twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler notes.
However, the aim, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, is to get Stroom Beach under the international blue flag quality label.
"Compared to Europe, Estonia has much more work to do to maintain the beaches", says Scholler.
We have more pity and stones and harder to sift through the sand.
However, there is less rubbish on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Upon hearing that garbage is being spoken of on the beach, Martin, who lives near Stroom Beach, uncompulsively enters the conversation of a journalist and cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
There's a disgusting picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle pickers who have pulled garbage bags upside down," martin reports.
While it's hard to assume that people will be able to change their behaviour so far, Martin hopes the city government will do something about the bins and put lids on them, for example, to at least stop the birds from going there.
In general, however, Martin is pleased with the development of Stroom Beach.
You can see the city's taking care of it.
With children's fields, illuminated and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
It used to be that roller skates could only ride on one road," martin notes.
Treasure hunter's findings in Stroom: coins, coins only
The morning tide has come to be taken advantage of by 40-year-old Dimitri, who combs the beachfront with a metal detector as a treasure hunter.
He doesn't think he's going to find anything precious today or in the future.
The gods of the sea are not generous enough for this.
"I've been doing this for a year and I haven't found anything valuable so far," says Dmitri.
As a hobby hunter, Dmitri's treasure bag includes a few euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous nails that later throw in the bin.
Usually there are coins.
"Gold, rings and stuff like that don't usually exist," says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at their previous levels, as strong economic growth and easing inflation have softened speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as squeezed household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
Policymakers from the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep rates at 0.25% and fewer members are calling for an increase this month as sluggish economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household incomes would remain as inflation is still expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank also signalled that rate increases will be necessary to contain Brexit-induced inflation over the next few years and that financial markets may need a higher-than-expected rise in borrowing costs.
Members also voted a year ago to partially withdraw the economic mammoth package launched as a result of Brexit.
The bank will end its fixed-term funding scheme in February, which offers cheap funding to banks, although it said it was now expecting a £15bn bigger offer of £115billion under the scheme.
In its minutes of the decision on the rate, the Bank says: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
On rates, it was reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" is necessary to ease inflation, to the extent "somewhat higher" than markets have expected.
The stock exchange is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any jumps are gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next are comparable to may's forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained.
After this news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $US1.31 and 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened growing hopes of a rise in GDP in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to gain some momentum at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave households suffering from rising inflation and abject wage increases little reason to cheer, saying the situation would get a little worse before it improved.
It added that monetary policy cannot prevent a hit to earnings over the next few years, but a significant recovery in wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The weak pound is also fuelled by growing demand for British output, which partly compensates for lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were moved to 0.25% last August following a shocking EU referendum that caused the pound to suddenly weaken.
The Bank estimates that it is likely to take four years to breathe life into prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's latest decision, there was growing demand for rate increases, as inflation had increased pressure on struggling households; In July, three policymakers called for the rate to be raised to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, down from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said it expected it to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excessive growth compared to the 2 per cent target was due entirely to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of mortgage brokerages at Coreco, said: "Given the recent fall in exchange rates, the mortgage market looks set to become increasingly competitive again as lenders crave work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose existing transactions are coming to an end, as refinancing, often at no service fees and at low rates, has become increasingly popular."
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will have access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that nhs health now makes an estimated 10,000 people available pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) - a tablet administered before intercourse that has shown a reduction in the risk of infection by around 86% for high-risk people.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court's ruling last year that the NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the agency's own claims that the drug should be funded by local authorities instead.
Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, hailed the move, which was unveiled on Thursday, as a "new large-scale intervention," while the National Aids Fund (NAT) described it as a "pivotal moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. More clinics will be added in October before the programme is introduced anywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are a sufficient number of certain medicines in the human body that prevent infection with HIV.
Such medicines can be taken daily or no later than two hours before intercourse.
Candidates eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not receiving treatment.
Clinics identify suitable people willing to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a GP there can also register their wish to participate in the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme costs £10million and NHS England signed a contract to receive the drugs this week following an international tender.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the true potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on who the medicine is for and how it is consumed and applied in the big picture.
Stevens said: "This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the large-scale and increasingly successful fight against hives.
This is yet another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of humanity's greatest health problems."
Deborah Gold, NAT's chief executive, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted at those who need it and are at risk, offers an opportunity to change England's HIV epidemic.
As of September, people at high risk of HIV in England will have access to a powerful new tool through this NHS-funded clinical trial, which is individually managed and does not depend on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The priority now is to ensure that the clinical trial is launched quickly across the country and that no person at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been procured, we are on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, shadow minister for public health, said: "The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and well delayed after months of delays and dragging the government's feet.
Evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to an end to hiv prevention and its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is introduced across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity increased by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania it fell.
In July, the difference in the next day's exchange price of electricity between the price areas of Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to EUR 1.94, compared to EUR 7.71 in June this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish connection.
In Estonia, the average exchange price of electricity was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour last month, and the price increased by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the system price of the Nord Pool electricity exchange was EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices rose by 12 and seven per cent respectively.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Finland in 75 per cent of the hours of the previous month towards Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of the hours between the two countries did not take place on the following day.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Latvia 99 per cent of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 per cent of the hours the total transmission capacity was in use.
According to transactions on the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day in July, the exchange price of electricity in August can be approximately 34 euros per megawatt-hour and in September 37 euros per megawatt hour.
The price of CO2, which affects the production price of electricity, increased last month and transactions took place at prices between EUR 5,04 and EUR 5,47 per tonne.
Living high - a semi-floor and smart design tips have turned this tiny Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate property innovator, swapped her large Knightsbridge home for an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the ground floor of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne has not packed up her bags and resold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived on a much larger ground in Knightsbridge with my former partner," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offer.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete upgrade.
At first, it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex layout - to reach the bedroom you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
Those were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from Duck &amp; Shed, an architecture and design studio in Notting Hill, to take advantage of the 3.8m-high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development object, but a place joanne could live in.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a semi-floor where you could stand upright.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
"The metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they were located on top of each other without having to bow.
It was not just about building a platform, but we used a steel structure to ensure that the height of both the upper and lower rooms was correct."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms with plenty of dramatic elements on top of each other in the room.
From the half-floor, the old-fashioned copper-light Retrouvius window overlooks the glamorous living space below.
Gold furniture with a mirrored surface, silver details and a retro Serge Mouille luminaire emphasize the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, spaciousness and brightness.
Mirrors are added at both ends of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror gives the impression of a window that opens into another room.
At the entrance, a mirror cabinet offers a storage facility for all of Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The charm of the living room is added by the possibility of closing the kitchen part when not in use, creating an image of a more glamorous room.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this kitchen is the fact that this is a garage-type retractable door.
"It got a little bit of a design effort," Erfan explains of the steel-reinforced veneered MDF door.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it slides very easily when pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"After all, the floor space is what you sell - or what gives value to the property," says Erfan.
"A real estate agent walks into a room in an outdated form and performs calculations based on the area of the floor."
Here they have managed to increase the floor area, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"Materials are the ones that you touch and thereby help to make an emotional connection with the home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make your heart ring."
This indicates that good design and enlarged area will help to make something amazing from a fairly ordinary apartment.
In fact, they may even make you want not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
The protagonist, Dane Jensen, is a bounty hunter in a Chicago skyscraper who competes with a colleague for a promotion.
It counts nothing more than the amount of money earned, next to which any ethics are forgotten.
His wife and three children can only be seen early in the morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I catch myself thinking it's a version of the business world of "House of Cards" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech mane is similar.
The more the film goes on, the fewer the frame-house element remains, and the moralizing intent of the filmmakers is beginning to stand out more and more.
A life-changing experience becomes the protagonist's son's cancer.
Now you have to make a choice between work and family life.
A son dreaming of a job as an architect makes his father walk to chicago's big buildings think about really important things like faith, goodness, love..., not even the twin tower disaster.
After the third scene, in which the son opens his father's eyes, there is a feeling that the filmmakers have taken aim at the goal of surely getting the audience to cry, because even the most stingy-hearted viewer cannot hold back the tears when he sees the suffering of a cute cancer-strid boy.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally understands the immor morality of his work and does a good deed to an old man looking for a job.
Now I bet on myself - if a movie has a happy self, I reward my insight after the film with coffee, but if I'm wrong, the screenwriter can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a suspicion that I'm going to miss coffee - when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes down the hallway toward the ward.
The son, on the other hand, has miraculously recovered, and although his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can predict the end of American drama pretty well!
To be honest, the film is well constructed, all the elements necessary for it are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and morality is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I guess this movie brings in well.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
Then he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the White House's new chief of staff plans to curb the flow of information, including news, that reaches President Trump in the hope that it will keep the commander in chief in flat water.
Here's an excerpt from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When The White House's new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with high-ranking officials on his first day in office, he highlighted a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to address by bringing bad information into the president's hands.
Kelly told officials that the information "would have to go through him, either on paper or in meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it, too, and they have failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV viewing habits have gone nowhere.
"If Candidate Trump was upset about dishonest media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was honestly featured in the affected publications," sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "according to six former campaign staffers, the key to controlling Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady margin of praise."
All right.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits have once been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign staffers know something that the rest of us don't know that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory without these interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't post.
If his assistants were able to get him out of trouble even a couple of times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from consistently causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House of rival cliques, people try exclusively to advance their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their worldview but may not always be credible.
Politico, which reports on the entire story, wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to feed the president information of strategically questionable value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Current and former Trump subordinates say that Trump may react to negative press, especially damaging information leaks, explosively, obsessed with identifying their source.
This was also the case in late February, when someone fondly gave the president a printed copy of a GotNews.com article on a website owned by the internet provocatetor Charles C. Johnson that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the "source of a series of leaks of information" from the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of the mocking, or that he offered no concrete evidence, or that he has made and withdrawn false accusations in the past.
Trump read the article and began asking subordinates about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Chief of Staff Rob Porter "have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that reach Trump."
How did it work?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aides are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad to the capital do not get permission to perform.
There are many foreigners kissing in the centre of Tallinn.
Those contacted by the Evening Standard admitted to playing in the Old Town without the permission of the city government.
The first one we found was three street musicians near the gates of Viru who had taken the same number of dogs with them.
It was clear that musicians with rastapats and burst clothes were backpackers who could use one shower to berry.
Despite her appearance, the only woman in the group played a fun rhythm on the accordion, while a man next to her juggled with three balls and invited passers closer.
A third man had sat next to them on a backpack and smoked a ready-made twist in peace of mind.
Their three dogs didn't let themselves be disturbed by the passing crowd.
Noem, who played the accordion, and Bob, who juggled the balls, said they were kissing on the streets for fun and money.
The aim of the company's performance was to collect ticket money for a ship sailing to Finland on the evening of the same day.
When asked if they asked the city for permission to kiss in the Old Town, Noem and Bob shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or two, and most of the time, permits are granted for a month or something.
There's no point in paying for it," Bob explained.
When we got back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with the musicians and drove them away.
The company moved with backpacks and dogs to the intersection of Viru Center to try their luck.
There were also three Polish young men on Viru Street, one playing violin, the other playing clarinet, and the third carrying an electronic piano.
"We are here to entertain people, to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living," explained Mivosh, the trio's pianist.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that the city government's permission must be available for the performance.
"Of course we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there's no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we'll go somewhere else, but we'll have to try," he added.
Eesti Pank bought 149 million euros of bonds in July as part of the public asset purchase programme of the central banks of the euro area, while the central bank's bond portfolio grew to 4.36 billion euros in total.
The central bank will not release more detailed information about the purchases.
In response to an inquiry by members of the Riigikogu, Bank of Estonia Governor Hardo Hansson has explained that the Eurosystem central banks' asset purchase programme covers three different purchase programmes: covered bonds in the financial sector (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds on the market to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest money elsewhere.
As a result of the purchases, the return on lower-risk assets falls and this motivates investors to take higher risks.
As a rule, under the public sector bond-buying programme, each central bank buys its own government bonds, and no bonds from other countries are purchased.
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
Replacement purchases are also made by central banks in those countries where the offer of bonds under the purchase programme is limited.
Eesti Pank generally buys bonds from European institutions, such as those of the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank, according to Hansson.
Eesti Pank has been buying bonds under the asset purchase programme since March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering bonds were also acquired, but eesti pank will no longer buy Elering bonds from June 2016.
Both Elering and Eesti Energia's bonds will be purchased by The Bank of Finland on behalf of the central banks of the euro area from June.
Travelers ignore ditch and return to 'millionaires'
Some of west Midlands' wealthiest homeowners have once again faced fierce confrontation with determined travellers who have ignored a ditch dug by the council to win back the field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field near the affluent "millionaire district" near baptized Solihull Street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and lorries after they were kicked out only in May without being distracted by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical team found a weak spot in the guard railing, squeezing their vehicles through an unhindered part that had been left on the footpath.
Furious residents have slammed Solihull Council, saying the council is "useless in dealing with the problem."
One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after they were emigrated from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The council must be shamed into taking action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back.
There were more of them last night, probably even more today."
He added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this kind of thing by procuring long barriers to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy that I have to continue paying council tax if the council can't even stop such a thing.'
One local resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: "This is ridiculous. We just saw the last of these travelers leave, and there's already a new offensive.
This time, the number has increased, and even a horse has been seen ruminating in the grassland."
A Solihull Council spokesman said: "We are aware that there is an unauthorised campsite on land near Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull Police. We will take the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It will be very helpful to gather evidence when as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
It will help to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
The Weekend festival is visited by Indrek Saar, Minister of Culture, among others, who is pleased that real world names have been brought to Estonia.
To the question of why the Weekend festival is so important to Estonians, Saar replies that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the festival's three days of talk to the fullest.
However, he acknowledges that real players in their field have arrived in Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this genre of music are brought home - this often does not happen in our area", says the Minister of Culture.
Which artists performing at the festival, however, speak most to The Island itself?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old people like me, surely one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
According to his record twist, all of us have twisted our own feet at some point," he says.
However, he also brings out several other names, such as the Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian players too: starting with NOËP and you can read a whole series of them.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high", he says.
Take a closer look at the Evening News video!
Audi upgrades up to 850,000 diesel vehicles amid criticism from automakers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the CHAIRMAN of BMW, the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW's hometown of Munich, which have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
No company described these actions as a recall.
European car manufacturers have been eager to promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitric oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles will increase for automotive companies, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German carmakers are under close investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of pampering powerful car makers and ignoring signs pointing to the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which was silent on the use of so-called fraudulent devices, which made it possible to adjust the reading of exhaust gases to comply with the regulations during car testing, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics division of Audi's engine development division was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may go on trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany after authorities accused Audit of installing a system to evade European emissions requirements, thereby expanding an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could be a major blow to Volkswagen as the luxury car maker generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
European Union flags are purchased for 20,000 euros for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education intends to purchase European Union flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
In total, 570 educational institutions with a size of 105x158 centimeters will receive the Flag of the European Union.
The flags are intended for indoor display, they must also be carried out indoors in high-quality printing equipment with tunnel fastening, mediated by the ERR news portal.
The tag on the flagpole reads: "A gift to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union of Estonia.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is 20,000 euros, at the price of the Ministry of Education, i.e. one flag costs 35 euros.
Journalist's murder highlights growing threat situation in Mexico
Riodoce weekly staff usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in sinaloa state, fuelled by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They're told it's important to change your routines.
Two senior journalists discuss which one seems safer: either bring the children with them to the office that was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the head of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters to give names in each column no evidence is needed, impressions and guts are enough.
Drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartels, and a whole list of bad guys who make it dangerous to report the chaos in Mexico.
There is no breather of violence, and the more bodies accumulate across the country, the majority of them are made up of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, and there have been at least 25,589 journalists in seven states since President Enrique Pena Nieto was sworn in in December 2012.
The latest casualties include their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a deep feel, although his presence can be perceived everywhere on the façade of the Riodoce building, a large picture of Valdez with his middle finger on it, along with "Justice", and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or the panama hat characteristic of him.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate Public Prosecutor's Office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted.
As with most annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, which amount to thousands, journalists' killers rarely end up in court.
Riodoce's editorial continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the murderers' data and justice, the security meeting won't do much good, according to Ibarra.
"It's very silly to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
"As long as the cause is unknown, you distrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive just a few blocks before two men stopped him in a red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and shot 12 times. This is presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which translates as "twelfth River".
An armed man drove off in Valdez's car and crashed nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors are spreading freely in Culiacan.
But there is basically only silence on valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival cliques fight to fill the power vacuum.
It doesn't matter that some people or even several are shot down on the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the cemetery is teeming with abundantly decorated double mausoleums of drug kingpins larger than the homes of many of the living.
Let us forget for a moment that peacetime refers to how a seaside state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States is run by only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce co-founder and manager Ismail Bojorquez (60) feels immense remorse for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes the killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the nose man of a cartel competing with Guzman's sons and at war.
This piece of writing may have angered the sons by suspected gang members buying all copies of the publication as soon as they arrived at the newspaper stalls.
Another mistake was that Valdezi was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid in another newspaper editorial covering the same story took place.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would be there forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the Noroeste newspaper in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling $50 shares.
Bojorquez said it was "impossible to deal with the press in Sinaloa without touching the drug problem."
Over time, the newspaper gained notoriety with its bold and honest coverage, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish vigorous research without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication from which they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its Latin American coverage.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (ACA) for his courage to follow Mexico's drug history wherever it leads.
He candidly admitted he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said, accepting the ACA award.
Last October, he told rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to embrace the task that comes with a journalist's profession is another way to play dumb.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on.'
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a joker who roamed like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He was always wearing his hat.
He went from office to el Guayabo bar across the road and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his love of routine was fatal to him.
His death has also made them question how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you mess with these women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites, which are used to transport drugs."
"These things were not supposed to be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result, even at the best of times, is strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to Andres Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, the problem is that "sense of smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero or other states that are home to a toxic combination of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers sought relief from the 40-degree heat in the shade of a tree.
The government appointed them to guard riodoce's office, which is housed in a four-story building in culiacan's middle-class neighborhood.
Some reporters wondered, half-jokingly, whether these police officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself has branded untrustworthy.
Several months have passed since reporters drove to the mountainous countryside, where de facto drug gangs are in control.
Riodoce's edition this week covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had a revealing account of spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement as to who was abducted or how it happened, so it was time to write what everyone in town knows about the restaurant, both for drug dealers and for the authorities.
The reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the entire last century.
More recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked a reporter to write about previous incidents at the same location, including how Guzman's son, who bears the nickname El Chapo, escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have been looking for a Valdez column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known what had happened before," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose sticky physique has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels with our sources have been interrupted."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and editorial staff have become something they never expected activists to do on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of tags and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration over another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been found and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal and are scribbling the phrase "SOS press" on pavements and buildings as an organized protest.
On this day, President Bojorquez is away in Washington, D.C., trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death while meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them by telling the truth.
He then asked for the government to be diverted from the coverage of the government's actions, worried that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "locked in" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, The Drug Press, he wrote that not only do drug gangs kill reporters, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who are in contact with organised crime.
The media monitoring group Articulo, 19, attributed the attacks on police and government officials to more than half last year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously blood-curdling.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in tamaulipas, a northern border state, six years ago.
His body was found with a letter believed to have been signed by the cartel Los Zetas: "I'm here for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to his chopped-up head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after their correspondent Miroslava Breach was killed in March.
Others continue to shoot as the El Manana de Nuevo Laredo newspaper did after the assassination of their manager in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez newspaper spoke openly to drug cartels with the editorial "What do you want from us?".
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It's a nerve-racking decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still have to pile up the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes they're chased, as probably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in 2015 in an apartment in Mexico city three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay put and continue to work have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that reporting on drug trafficking scares her.
"Mexico is on its way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce's editors sat on the pavement in front of the office and sipping beer as everyone's phones suddenly began to vibrate.
In the beachside resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people had been killed in gunfire between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as did a number of messages left by cartels found in the area.
From the same sidewalk, reporters posted the news on riodoce's website using a mobile phone.
The front cover of the next day needed to be changed.
Sirens theded another firefight in the area.
Bojorquez peeked at the officers on duty to see if they were vigilant.
If they were scared, at least they didn't show it.
Beneath a massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, on which his middle finger can be seen all over Sinaloa, Riodoce's employees followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think about closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosaur used protective paint to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, although quite scary.
Scientists have now unveiled the first findings of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered with his scales was reddish-brown in color, and his past had been somewhat "complex".
The report, published in the journal Current Biology, described the creature as "the best-preserved armoured dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the chalk age, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation struck scientists, who describe it as "truly remarkable."
This armored vegetarian is the best preserved fossil of the type ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he was mining at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He struck something that did not resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to take a closer look.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, work was underway to excavate the animal from a 2,500-pound (1,100-pound) plot of land.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be brought to the public domain.
"If you look a little bit, you can almost believe he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It will go down in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
By studying his skin, the researchers found that this plant-eater, while covered in scales and resembling a walking tank, was likely significantly threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
This large-scale dinosaur used red and white protective paint to hide from predators, and applied a shading technique called a counter-eclipse, which is also used by many modern animals.
This allowed the dinosaur to blend better into the surroundings and avoid enemies, according to experts, as larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt it.
This 110 million-year-old creature belonging to the Nodosaurus family first made the news in May and is now visited by the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The creature has now been studied by scientists and named after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory assistant at the Markmichell Museum in Borealopelta, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours uncovering the animal in arduous manner.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the animal's body.
They discovered the counter-eclipse - a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the top half of the creature was darker than the lower one.
Although the counter-eclipse has spread, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than the animals living with the counter-eclipse today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was actively hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs enough that evolution preferred shelter instead of confrontation as a survival tactic.
However, most modern animals using the counter-eclipse - such as deer, zebras or armadillas - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to really work to survive.
"The vigorous hunt for a dinosaur covered in enormous and abundant scales shows how dangerous chalk-age dinosaur predators could have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the armored organic compounds also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its intestine, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe the dinosaur fell into the river when it died, thereby reaching the sea with a current, where it sank to the bottom of the ocean in front of its back.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans probably extended much further inland than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved armoured skin, while it has also remained three-dimensional, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, today the animal looks almost the same as in the chalk age.
You don't have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it - it's enough just to kiss your eyes and it feels like he's sleeping.'
The chalk age was a time when huge two-legged carnivorous dinosaurs - teropods - wandered the Earth.
Although king Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a monster 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and weighing six tons.
The researchers, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe borealopelta washed up in the sea after death and mummified in mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he was mining at the Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured inosaurus in the world, including leather and scales, and is a complete cone up to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch-long squirrels penetrated its shoulders.
Scientists believe this armored plant-eater adventured through present-day western Canada until a flooded river washed it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial site helped maintain its scales in excellent detail.
The petrified remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that mysterious armoured plates along the dinosaur's skulls still cover the remnants of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine: "This degree of preservation is as rare as a lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it feels.
The remnants of the petrified skin still cover the mysterious armoured plates on the animal's skull.
The right front leg lies next to him, and five toes are stretched upwards.
I'll be able to count the armor on his sole."
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a complete shock.
Just a day after traveling to New York, this St. Louis resident sat on a bed in a rented room through Airbnb, browsing Facebook on his phone.
He came across a post from his former schoolmate.
It said: "The police just killed an 18-year-old youth and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on his feed, which is why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
The handle @TheePharoah user's posts had been repeatedly shared on his timeline.
The St. Louis-area rapper delivered live tweets about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He hung up his phone, but saw again tweets later that evening announcing a gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
Photos of police tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown's father were shared holding a sign that read "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!".
He watched a live stream where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, he said, wisted a gun and yelled, "I'm going to kill you all... animals.'
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, "This is unusual."
""This is not the kind of murder that we are used to and what we might call typical."
I felt fearmongers at the time.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., he went to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided they were going to Ferguson alone the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Whose Streets?"), which premieres in cinemas on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and tenacity from the point of view of those who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell and his daughter - who was wearing a floral dress and a crown matching her head - drove toward Ferguson, they chatted again about the subject they had repeatedly discussed before that morning - about the experiences and living conditions of black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" he recalls himself asking.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't not take him with me," Ferrell said afterwards.
"What's happening right now is... the culmination of what has happened in the past.
He needs to know it and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about activism and organizing, while also knowing the different layers of black experiences and living conditions and what we need to do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise her in a way that she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she's no different from another black girl.
I feel like I would do him a disservice if I protected him from this world."
The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road - a place across the road from the police station that had become a kind of campground where activists were waiting for news about police officer Darren Wilson, who was never charged in the end.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who prepared lunch meals.
They put food bags together and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism completely changed after August 9th," he said, noting that when he was in Missouri-St. A student at Louis University, he was president of the Association of Minority Nursing Students and focused on food fairness and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organizing experience.
It all just worked out."
Weeks later, During the evening demonstration, Ferrell met with sabaah Folaan, the film's co-director.
Folayan said he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was going on.
The question arose in Ferrell's head: "Are you trying to document what is happening or to find a story that can be exploited?"
This scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come into the community and try to capitalise on its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not heard, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already struck hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the area known for activism in relation to death row inmates.
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrell and six other locals watched by the crew of the film Whose Streets for years after Brown's shooting.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, but we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
"It was important to me how these people were portrayed, because that's how I'm portrayed."
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement was not about "a redeemer's guide, but about a community reunion," as Folayan put it - he became the film's most open actor.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing the first time he saw the finished linen work.
"But I realized that doing this job and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
What's more, Ferrell's story emphasizes and re centers on the role of black homosexual women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three initiators, who came up with a theme #BlackLivesMatter following the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin on social media in 2012, are homosexual.
"Black homosexual women in leadership roles have sustained the movement in general," Ferrell said, "and that's precisely because we have to continually fight on multiple fronts.
Black homosexual women must bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women, and many of them are black homosexual women."
He maintains, however, that "this is not some type of equal opportunity creation type" - Ferrell was not chosen as the film's focal point because of his identity.
"He was the person who blew the right energy," he said.
"But it is no coincidence that she was right on the front line, because there is a lot at stake as a black homosexual woman living in such knots.
His energy can be perceived through the screen."
Meanwhile, news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police remain fragile.
The suspended sentence handed down to Ferrell for blocking the highway during the demonstration is another 2.5 years.
He describes the sociopolitical atmosphere in the area he calls home as simply a "crude threat."
Nevertheless, he still attaches great importance to the mantra he has etched in memory since he took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
7 tips to get over the hangover after the Weekend party
Some of the toughest sons of men find it helpful after a booze-filled party.
Or follow the saying "avoid a hangover, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a decent bang for health.
What can you do to feel better in the morning and get over the hangover as painlessly as possible after the weekend race - or any other party?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and on, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when consuming alcohol, somehow it needs to be recovered.
Along with water, minerals are also washed out of the body, and therefore it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after a nap, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
Surely a hangover wouldn't pay to head to grandma's to break down trees - it could prove a fatal lie.
But a light walk will help the body to remember again what it's like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and sleeping out a hangover is a more time-consuming way to heal.
Give the body back energy slowly and carefully.
If you're already throwing up from yesterday's over-drinking, you certainly shouldn't try to load a large fat fry into your stomach.
Start, for example, with fresh juice containing fruit sugars to quietly boost your body.
If around noon health already suffers, then you could try broth, for example.
And a little later, i'm back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will free your body from the last water.
As has already been said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take an analgesic to prevent a hangover in the evening, your liver will have to deal not only with alcohol, but also with paracetamol or ibuprofen and thus lose performance.
This will ruin your liver even more, and in the future the hangovers will be worse.
In addition, the painkiller does not stay in the body very long anyway.
If you take an analgesic in the morning, don't do it on a completely empty stomach - it will irritate your already hashed stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, get along well with yourself.
Works in much the same way as walking, but you can't have an orgasm when you walk.
However, avoid too active pace and crazy poses - during a hangover, physical exertion should be moderate.
Make fun of it.
Have a fool's talk with friends and co-sufferers of time, do simple silly things and laugh amicably at yourself and others (suffering).
Jokes and laughter may not drive away the hangover, but it's certainly more fun to put up with the aftershocks.
One day the hangover will pass anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee wanted on suspicion of murder
Police say they are searching nationwide for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee who has become suspects after the body of a man with fatal stabbing wounds was found in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
According to Cook County court documents, arrest warrants were issued Monday without bail for the arrests of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on charges of first-degree murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after being repeatedly stabbed.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a phone call and found a victim with multiple stab wounds to his body when he arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and investigators are treating the stabbing as murder while police actively search for two suspects.
Lathem has worked since 2007 as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem has now been temporarily suspended and banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal case being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant in the finance department at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist US investigative bodies in every possible way."
The statement also said Warren's colleagues are shocked and want her to be extradised.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of communications at the Chicago Police Department, urges suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but we are increasingly intensive in determining the exact location," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are helping to search for the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received an cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to police descriptions, this was a powerful sight.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi added.
Grand Plaza management sent a letter to residents saying: "Police are currently working to establish the chronology of events and the background of the victim and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that this was a family dispute."
Start-ups to help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce start-up, but the polls were futile.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse still, misleading.
And even though he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"This system just wasn't consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company that sells hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called on outsiders to help.
New types of human resources start-ups are emerging to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software that is designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide anonymity and a hot line of complaints to employees, and in some cases allow language carriers to bypass C-level managers and contact the board directly.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your business?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
According to Erretti, in the three years that he has used Glint, he has had a much better understanding of what his employees think and feel.
In addition to surveys aimed at flash surveys and specific teams, it provides a company heat map that gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to identify the causes.
Companies are beginning to realize that they need to stay up to date with their work culture so as not to become the next Uber, which has been mired in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing a harrowing environment in which those who dared to speak out were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to fintech statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a start-up based in Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity this year against the backdrop of Uber's dubious reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send custom impulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
And when the CEO is involved, the complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been driven by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, Convercent's founder and CEO.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees badly or behave unethically, the company could face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 sites, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporation's headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, they had to find the phone number or email address of the corporation's headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope it was taken seriously.
It was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday general counsel James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to monitor employee complaints.
However, now that the company is using Convercent, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair pay practices that did not previously reach managers operating in offices in other cities or states can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of employees," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said companies began taking ethical behavior, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But it wasn't until "social media matured" that companies realized they couldn't stop their dirty laundry from being washed openly online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service by charging companies periodic fees for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supportive of both start-ups.
Convercent was funded in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital for $10 million, raising the capital raised to $47 million.
Glinti invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments do not come as a surprise, given the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are merely bets on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company that has a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, feel that they are being listened to, and that the work they do is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice president of general benefit and employee experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn a return when the companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies do well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee commitment and engagement, it's no wonder they're finding support.
Having data on employee involvement is important, according to experts in the work culture.
However, this data will be useless if the company's supervisors do nothing with them.
In fact, when a company asks its employees for feedback, it can create expectations that changes lie ahead.
And if the changes do not happen quickly enough or not at all, it can cause frustration and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting and business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because when things don't end, the staff think, "Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?" "
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly surveys among employees, has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees disappointed in the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to restructure several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, collects new data on workers and hopes that in the long term this will lead to a longer-term commitment of workers in an industry known for its high turnover of labour.
"If you're not committed to transparency, you lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses."
The baltics are the shining star of the euro area: incomes are growing fast
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the incomes of rich countries in Western Europe, writes Bloomberg, referring to the European Central Bank report.
According to the central bank, since 1999, the total output per capita of the economy in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Success is due to low indebtedness, rapidly improving institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic States, together with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where real GDP per capita in purchasing power has significantly converged on the EU average", the central bank reported.
Although the goal is that the total output per capita of the economy would be equal to the richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total output per capita of the Baltic economies was only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led Balts to seek better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic states in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, the local population is not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of latvian and Lithuanian residents estimated that their economies were doing very well, or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, just under half of those surveyed thought this about the economies of their countries.
NCAA's decision to cancel 2-day practice makes Bruins' days long
It's almost 23:00 when a bunch of UCLA football players stop to chat on the edge of a new practice field on the team's campus.
Some of them have peeled off their shirts, revealing a sweaty back from the efforts of the first day of their training camp.
For much of the team, these idle minutes offer a midday break.
Players taking summer courses will head back to the dormitory after a three-hour workout to study for final exams before returning to wasserman Football Centre for meetings at 6.30am the next morning.
"The next three days are a real challenge for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's game.
The NCAA's decision to cancel twice-a-day workouts to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer - at least until the final exams are over on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA's first three training sessions were scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to fit into the players' already busy schedule.
Switching from two workouts a day means more single-workout days - the start of Bruins training camp was almost a week ahead compared to last season, and for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons, training sessions take place during summer courses.
They have 18 workouts scheduled for August 20 before starting formal preparation for the opening game in September against Texas A&amp;M.
Mora says he's in favor of an NCAA rule change, though it adds another item to the players' tight schedules.
"They have a huge load on three or four days and that's a real challenge," Mora said.
"And they will break through this ordeal; they make an effort, they're nice young people.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really nice."
Once the camp is over, UCLA's training will be closed, which is by no means an easy task, given the clear view of their fields from a nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luckin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been hit by footballs bypassing the safety net surrounding the goalpost.
Starting this weekend, the Hotel will be occupied by Bruins players, but Mora acknowledged that problems could arise with spare rooms during the season.
"We are implementing security measures," Mora said.
'It's a real concern and it's not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film a workout from there.
If you have a record of training, it can make a pretty good deal.
But we're using a security team there and in the 8th parking lot.
We will do our best to use what we have.
I try not to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place."
In retaliation for the Savisaare-Ivanova electoral union born to the Central Party, our Tallinn, which was created to unite the forces of Kristiina Ojuland and Maria Kaljuste, who were expelled from the Reform Party, and the businessmen's electoral union Tegus Tallinn, which is hoping to show the party's voters - it seems that the electoral unions created on the initiative of those who have been scorched in party politics are taking part in local elections at least as much as political parties this year.
Chicks, however, are considered autumn, and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who's staying with Savisaare?
How small edgar Savisaare's supporters have become, one can guess from the events organised in honour of his electoral union.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current centrists and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And can the reason why some loyal supporters and friends of Savisaare stand aside from running in Tallinn can be that the 'Savisaare list' of perpetrators, headed by corrupt and suspected corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the district government for a Russian-language pop song featuring a parent from lasnamäe district; and, in all respects, a rudimentary computer game in which prime minister Jüri Ratas, the protagonist, must avoid limps and squirrels on the road while riding his bike - is this how the Centre Party is trying for the first time to get the votes of 16- and 17-year-old voters allowed at the ballot boxes?
We look forward to seeing what the other parties have in their vision of a youthful election campaign.
If, from the beginning of August, Channel 2 or TV3 viewers are faced with a black box instead of an entertainment show, there are two options: to accept that in the future only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English-language France24 channels will be seen on free-to-air, or to give up ten to a TV operator every month.
There are probably those who initially rejoice in the ad-free TV experience in public, but in the end still - albeit reluctantly - pay for tv pictures and advertisements.
Deafening music, noisy people and rubbish left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
However, if you don't want to be a part of the memento yourself, it's worth exploring your homeland instead of hurting your head at home - and leaving your sleep for a hefty sum for festival-goers.
Washington changes green card rules
Media outlets quote President Donald Trump as saying a new U.S. immigration plan is planned to change the rules on the green card.
The plan envisages reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The bill will go to trial in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers' money as it changes the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said, according to Media Outlets in the United States.
Siberian seto youth move to the city, pensioners return to the countryside.
Yevseyev's Anatoly continues the tradition of former famous seto gold miners along the Maana River.
He works 140 kilometres from his home on the Maana tributary Kuvai as a driver in the gold artelli.
It's a tough job: two months in a row without days off, 12 hours of work, and then only ten days at home and back again.
In the three years he worked at Artell, Anatoly has only seen gold once.
"There's a lot of order: when you go in, you're going to be thoroughly checked to make sure you don't bring vodka, and when you go out, don't take the gold," says Anatoly.
Mare Piho chatting to local seto Jaan in haida village, who has told her a lot about her family's memories in Siberia.
The still preserved archaic culture of Siberian setos also begins to affect domestic setos, because it is simply so fabulous, thinks Piho Mare, who has studied the most distant setos in most thoroughly.
It will be 30 years since his first exploration trip to Siberia.
During this time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many settles did they still migrate to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I'm saying that 8,000.
I counted it out on the stories of Siberian seto men who have thought about it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly, because at that time up to 30 people could come in one group, but the passport was given only to a man.
The passport was given to only one, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how big this territory was here!
It was many times larger than historic Setomaa.
It needed to be educated, managed in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they ended up in areas not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (log rafting), gold mines, industry.
In New Petser, for example, many setos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (where soviet power built a uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the Setos make up the majority of the population in the region at the time?
yes, they lived compact.
In addition, the tradition of marrying each other and having a lot of childhood was preserved for a long time.
Seven or eight children in the family were commonplace.
How much did the culture of Siberian setos differ and differ from that of motherland setos?
They're different, even though what was brought here was never the same there.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
They did it themselves then (folk clothes), but they always made a difference between what had been brought along and what was done here.
Climate change has had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of setos, because it is colder here.
The food changed.
Setomaal meat, for example, was salted, but just frozen here.
Where are the villages of Siberian setos and what life lives there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The connection with the motherland was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back there, start to affect them.
These girls who have lived in these families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian setode delegation, who came to the village of Haida in early July for the day of the Kingdom of Seto and lived for four days in their homes - J.P.
What's left here, it's amazing.
"It's super easy for Tapa to come and go, because the city has a great location: at the railway hub and at the intersection of the highways," says Reigo Tamm, an opera soloist from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural sites, and pizza can be found on every corner.
Tapa is a top-to-toe city!
Along the White River running through the city, there is a small island where the killers tend to have a janitor's party.
"This beautiful place doesn't look like a train window," muses Reigo.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in this river, because the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming there, it's going to be all right!
You can have a picnic on the river and just have a romance - you can look at the river flow and think ahead and behind life.
I've been out there walking my brides, too.
The opera soloist Tamm, among other things, has been practicing his arias between three bridges on the riverbank: "Since this place is on the edge of town, no one can come back when I tell my own stories."
"Männikumäe has wonderful views of Tapa, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and now play disc golf, for example - the golf course is done, the discs can be rented from the fitness center", directed by Reigo.
The old pros go there with their discs, of course, but I haven't gotten there to play yet.
My colleague Rasmus Kull must probably be invited to visit Tapa, because he is an experienced disc golfer and has discs.
Maybe he'll lend it to me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the times of the current opera soloist's childhood.
At least during ski lessons.
There's a lot of tears, disappointments left on this mountain, and you can in my sports life.
Not to mention broken sleds and skis.
"The whole city centre is currently full of construction work, all this is becoming unknown," reigo praises.
Tapa's old and tired vault building, however, is a very attractive place to play summer discoveries.
I am pleased that in 2012 Märt Meos, the head of R.A.A.A.A.M., accepted my idea and came to the station with his theatre to do summer theatre.
Although this year's theatrical season with "Alexei Karenin" has just come to an over, on August 11th there will be a "Revival" at the railway station, when the old vault building moves around in the 1980s.
"From 11 to 13 August, tapa city days, where open home cafes have been awakened and a series of cultural events are taking place, including a rally," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city just in time for noil days.
In a tiny yellow cottage on May 1, the museum has been around since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and tremendous information," Reigo praises the place, which is full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on railways and warfare.
Reigo muses that if Tapal goes through all the suggested places, the stomach will go empty for a long time, but fortunately the small town will be full of cafes.
"We have such good eateries and sometimes when you sit in cafes you feel like you're abroad," he describes.
Educated and young tapale soldiers spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there feels strange that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but there is such an international company all around.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we have a lot going on!
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Television station bTV quoted the Foreign Ministry as reporting that two Bulgarians had been taken into custody in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, police arrested a group of illegally camping people on the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but an investigation is underway.
The Foreign Ministry told tv channel bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing harsh fines on anyone caught resting in a place not intended for this purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court can impose a fine.
Wolves that teach puppies go to break sheep.
Farmers in Hiiumaa have to give wolves "educational material" from their flock again after a year's break - apparently wolves that have taught puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves have broken sheep three times in Hiiu County, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the corresponding number was only three, up from 124 a year earlier.
The Environment Agency also reports that no wolf litters were born in Hiiumaa last year, and information from the Hiiumaa Hunting Council that two wolf litters have been fixed on the island this year.
On the night of Monday, wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in the municipality of Emmaste and injured half of the surviving sheep.
Early Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep on pastures in the village of Reheselja and severely injured another, who had to be subjected to an emergency.
The rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law amending the Law on the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to the coordination round.
The amendment to the act abandons the creation of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) crop locations and operators, using the Plant Health Register in the future.
In addition, the obligation of the GM crop operator to have a prior agreement within the prescribed radius with the person engaged in beekeeping is amended.
Although gm crops are not currently grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non-gm crops.
This is at least until it has been decided to declare Estonia GMO-free", said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it is necessary to take into account that the measures developed must be fit for purpose and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden stemming from both the private and public sectors", Suu added.
The draft law repeals the provisions in GMOVS relating to the gm crop location and handler database and handling training, establishes requirements for the handling of GM crops and the commencement of economic activities.
As regards beekeeping in specific terms, the current obligation on gm crop growers to inform beekeepers of the commencement of GM crops is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before starting cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult it in the drafts information system and, if they so wish, submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The proposed changes will affect in particular crop-growing persons, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.
Only one GM crop is allowed to be grown in the European Union, including Estonia- MON 810 maize.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing gm crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no maize pest in Estonia, a European stem bee, for which the MON 810 maize line is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this cornline are bred for the southern regions, and this corn is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In order to obtain the above assurance, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in the seeds of various varieties of summer swedes, maize and soya grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain any foreign genes and the study concluded that the seeds of the rapeseed, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that gm crops are not deliberately grown in Estonia and it has also been confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruit Nemanja Matic is a 'genius'
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matic after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The £40million player, bought from Chelsea, started in Dublin in United's last pre-season game before the Uefa Super Cup win against Real Madrid on Tuesday 2-1 in the opening round, impressing in defence, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on the offensive.
But having been sidelined from the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Matic was left in desperate need of match form and lasted only 45 minutes. That, according to Mourinho, must be improved from a certain time before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mindset - he has a football mindset," Mourinho said.
"We will help him achieve form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the starting line-up at the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho quietly began setting up his 11 starting men at the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club have already done an "excellent job" by signing contracts for three of his four priority selections.
"I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another swamp cub was hit on the leg by a GSM transmitter on August 1, this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a birdwatcher living in Sõrve, the first cucumber was accompanied by Sõrves, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nest site and joined the large overnight collection of Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because there are no fruit fields in Sõrve, writes The Voice of the Islands.
This Tuesday, relatively late for ringing the throats, another stork got attached to the transmitter, and this one on Muhu Island.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is in fact an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a stork named Mati was supplied with a GSM escort on Sõrves Türjul.
"His work is all watchable on the Internet: how he went wintering in Spain, stuck on the German-Polish border for a long time and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
British inventor had microchip installed in his body to get into house and car with hand pin
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could simply open his front door with a hand sign, get into the office and even start a car.
Steven Northam, 33, had a tiny chip installed between his thumb and his naming finger, and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip to be installed in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company is also replacing the locks of houses and cars to match the chip, asking for £300 for one lock.
This married father-of-one has installed the technology both at home and in his car, the BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents released to TIME magazine, the White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Yard last month for an event celebrating American production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, dubbed Marine One while on board the president, was the central attraction of an event on American construction programs held at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials trained industrial products from all 50 states during their tour.
The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck made in Mississippi.
According to documents from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the squadron responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House Military Cabinet requested a helicopter presence section order, or FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the south yard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high-level event," the commander of HMX-1 said in an email the day before the event to his superior, deputy chief of the Navy's chief of staff in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter will arrive in the south yard at around 7:00 a.m. on the morning of July 17 for the event, which will begin at 15:00 and will remain there until the yard is cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 that evening.
It added that should leaving the White House be delayed, a second equestrian period would be required for a return flight due to working time restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the squadron's security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read from the documents given to TIME magazine whether or not a second equestrian period was finally needed.
Hatch's law prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 was investigating whether this event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law, and we were told we wouldn't," the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a choice," the deputy chief officer replied.
The White House declared the event "American-made" an official event, and Hatch's law would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The president supported the efforts of health care reform that was under discussion in the Senate at the time and praised efforts to rein in government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically lucrative purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for a photo session is unusual.
Trump came under the spotlight in February when the president's plane rolled into the background at his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is teeming with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the president's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the "American-made" display, which featured products from all 50 states made of American materials by American workers," said White House spokeswoman Acting Chief Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 teams often perform tests around Washington and in the south yard to practice putting down the President of the United States to the White House with centimeter accuracy.
When Trump was in Germany for the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 made 58 test landings in the White House courtyard.
According to the official, the flight to the event was included in the "American-made" flight crew's scheduled flight this month.
Squadron helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
According to the White House, no other exhibit at this event burdened the taxpayer's wallet.
According to a representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in arranging the exhibit in the southern yard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep budget documents for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
The squadron's documents marked the length of the flight from its main base at Navy Quantico airport in Virginia for 30 minutes in both directions.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount.
"It is very misleading to calculate taxpayers' costs based on estimated compensation rates," Walters said.
'These estimated compensation rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other sunk costs to be taken into account for the annual appropriations.'
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Department of Defense's compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they do cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event at the time.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security and that there are expected to be hundreds, if not even thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it's right to highlight it."
It's not clear whether Trump came into contact with the helicopter while touring the South Yard as part of the event, but he was sitting behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives, making fun of the company's products in his personal fleet, according to media outlets.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - peace and joy arrived through tears
In 2011 MM Daegus hit Shadeiko in the last area, a leg cramp in the 800m, and the pitch was taken away from the stadium by stretcher.
Just before that, he had received zero in the distance jump on the universiade held in China.
The 2012 Helsinki EM was ruined by a spear-throwing injury, but at its debut olympics in London it took 23rd place with 6,013 points.
However, the misfortune continued.
At the Moscow MM in 2013, after the opening day, the Estonian woman who was on the estonian record schedule suffered a thumb injury in the distance jump.
Two years later, he took 15th place at the Beijing MM and met the Olympic standard, but it was also a disappointment for an athlete who wanted more.
The heaviest cadence flag was only passed by Šadeiko last year, when he did not initially receive a letter in the distance jump at amsterdam EM.
I'd just like to put together a decent multi-race one time.
Once," Shadeiko confessed.
Worse was yet to come: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was interrupted by a thigh injury at the first hurdle.
Time had to be taken down - do we even have to continue with the seven competitions?
Is two days of effort still worth all this?
She thought long and hard, but she found peace in herself.
I got my head cleaned up
It's relatively hard to describe the experience, but I've been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal yourself and clear your head.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pills in the bag yet," Šadeiko says of her self-cleaning.
I was able to turn a clean sheet and get on with the new momentum.
Coach Anne Mägi said it was very difficult to watch the suffering of the caregiver, but he understood that, above all, the athlete himself needed to figure it out.
He was so devastated by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wanted to prove to himself what he was worth," Mägi says.
Now there's some peace in him.
He's doing it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May, when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6,280 points in the Götzis multi-race competition.
In a high-profile race, he improved his personal top mark in the ball race by nearly a metre (13.89) and ran in a hurdles race close to the record.
Then the multi-racer felt that this was not a ceiling of ability at all, but that it was just the primary hunger for competition that was erased.
Mägi, who has coached him for years, says That Shadeiko is a black-collar man.
He's a ready-made athlete, he's good to train.
If something's hurt or wrong, he's going to say it right now.
He knows his body and trusts his sense of self.
That is what we need to be guided by.
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and we will follow it.
Šadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the kind of person who does the maximum in practice," he says, and says the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
Loved ones' baby happiness makes you happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Shadeiko by the happiness of loved ones.
Both her former training partner Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-racer has received support from the new weather people.
"It's been pretty interesting," says Shadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking equals "training" the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big fan of wine that he believes - wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the "very active" process of tasting wine.
By sniffing a glass, spinning wine in our mouths, enjoying it and sensing the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules do not actually contain flavor, but taste arises from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He brings comparisons to how the brain "sees" colors.
"The taste isn't in the wine, the taste creates the wine tasting," says Sheperd.
The things that still affect the emergence of the taste of wine are, for example, our age, sex and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Sheperd admonishes, of course, that wine isn't about getting drunk.
"There has to be more to do," he says.
If you take too much limp, the system is oversaturated.
Excessive drinking can harm the brain instead of benefiting - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine risk losing their memory, losing balance and having reduced mental capacity.
10% of employees in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less than their colleagues
Data from the human resources search company Fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less than their colleagues.
The 10 percent pay gap is between men and women, writes portal Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the Fontes ICT sector wage survey.
A total of 8 577 posts were examined.
63% of the posts were held by men.
"While only 3 companies noted that the pay gap is in favour of men and the rest of the companies believe there is no pay gap, in reality, compared to similar jobs, men's monthly basic wages are on average 10% higher than women's, and men's total annual wages are on average 8% higher than women's," said Fontes analyst Ilmar Northa.
'Narcos' season 3 promotional clip: Now pablo Escobar is gone, Cal's cartel takes centre stage in Netflix hit series
Despite the fact that the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed in the second season of "Narcos," the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first has already produced a promotional clip teasing the series with new villarins.
In its third season, the DEA turns its attention to the world's richest drug trafficking organization, the Cali Cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers "like a Fortune 500 company," simply with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is the brainchild, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages ties with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a newly released promotional clip, Pedro Pascal is seen returning as Javier Penana, a character recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement to help in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narcos" kicks off on September 1.
UN says Afghan democracy depends on women's role in politics
The head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday that elections can only represent the nation if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the U.N. relief mission, said hundreds of women are standing for election to local councils, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of the role of women," she said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved at all stages of the electoral process.
Elections and presidential elections to local councils in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
For its part, the Taliban have threatened an electoral process that coincides with a transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power has been peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything more awesome, both big and small.
There is always too little time in common, but working out with the bastards provides a good opportunity to combine being together, playing, closeness and exercise.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you cruise in the summer, live gooses will always accompany you and impatiently remind you with your thin voice: "Let's work out now!"
Start with a warm-up - it's very good to have a regular hawk game or run along the beach strip.
The squat is the backbone of staying in the shape of legs and buttocks - who would want to take the shape of a sandcake washed from the waves over the summer?
It's wonderful to use kids instead of a lever!
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, the weight gradually grows at the same pace as the strength of the trainer.
Advanced ones can also make squats with real big kids.
The child trains balance, reads repetitions and feels the fun of being high on the tendon and being important.
Larger children can make squats themselves at the same time.
The extent of the movement is determined by touching the ground and stretching out your hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini-helper to hold on properly.
A child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is a super useful but hopelessly boring exercise for a child.
But it's easy to make it more fun!
Game plank: Take a long plank column from which to take turns.
Actually, it's harder than usual, but a lot more fun to do than you can give a friend a hand in the meantime.
To add load, you can stay on the planks, tiny withers, and also walk around in this position.
An extra weight can make a small child sit on their hips, but this exercise will provide fun for all children.
While crabs simble on the sand, tritisps, buttocks and abdominal muscles get a load like a naksti.
The child descends to his feet so that his body weight is distributed equally forward and back.
You can hold hands for security.
Curl your legs and straight up.
A kid can fly, have fun, train balance and be a weight.
A little coach's life is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he comes up.
Additional load is given by stretching the legs in advance.
Check that the back remains in a neutral position.
The children themselves have much more fun to do with a pair of abdominal muscles and a clap.
A squat with handiwork and pulse.
Monitor the child's safety, knee position, and keep your back in a neutral position.
A favorite of all children and great fun!
For a parent at the same time really effective full-body exercise.
Sporting tools included Ott (10), Säde (8), Luck (4).
A trip from the Philippines to the heart of fashion fans
Straw braided bags are a summer classic that has become a hit product in recent years, with one proper summer navigator having to hang on his arm and being welded by merchants despite its modest origins to weld a price tag appropriate to the hit.
A bag braided with straw is probably one of those things that has existed for everyone once in their lives and whose possession has not generated much emotion.
It just exists, and if it's not, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, straw bags are making a real triumph, and fashion fans have swapped their fancy designer bags for simple straw braided bags for the summer months.
It's not just a beach bag, it's just as popular today as a street bag, and braver women even walk into the office with it.
At this point, however, it is worth making it clear first whether a summer look like this for the boss still sits, or whether it is worth pushing the wet and laptop to a slightly more formal sumadan.
The variety has made shoulder bags a true summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that stands out is that fashion gourmets are the first thing to do on a holiday trip to the local market and buy themselves some straw bags, which are then faithful for the rest of their holidays, and which come with the beach, the market and also the girlfriends hanging out on the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a larger chunk of bags on the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It's worth noting that the demand for bags is so high among readers that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go hand in hand with each other to become the lucky owner of a few bags.
In a way, this madness is also understandable, because it is rare for a few times in the fashion world to buy yourself something that has risen to hit status for just a few dozen euros.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple way to make money here, and so the finer luxury brands also sell straw bags for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Probably still so that richer customers don't have to feel like simple mortals who are promening around with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a shoulder bag that will pay over 1,000 euros for Dolce &amp; Gabbana.
However, chanel's shoulder bag interpretation can cost around €6,000.
Unlike most fashion designers, however, straw bags do not come from some of the great fashion houses, but their story originated farther away.
Straw bags are said to originate in the far philippines from which they have been carried in the wide world.
The braiding of the straw bag is especially common there, and the locals do not see them walking around very often.
Supposedly, the straw-braiding technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite shaky with ordinary basket-braiding.
However, since the shoulder bag does not need to be braided as strongly as the basket, patterns and other materials can be embedded in them, which will make the bag more personal and, by extension, more active.
For example, recently there have been particularly trendy bags with colorful ribbons or leather stripes braided in.
However, the letter of thanks may first and foremost be sent to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest braided shoulder bag fan had never been seen before.
Namely, she matched her shoulder bag to all kinds of clothing sets and didn't even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival with it.
However, the fact that caring for them is a cockhead does not play a smaller role in the popularity of bags today, and unlike all sorts of other sumadans, they do not need to be cared for by special means, but also by water and a wet towel.
As is always the case with trend tracks, brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations besides the classic look.
For example, if you wish, you can buy yourself a braided dressing gown from straw or a tiny shoulder bag instead.
At the same time, it's worth remembering that a classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, while a straw bag does.
But what's the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, such a straw-braided bag, reminiscent of a basket in its style, has been considered classic, is open on top and has short handles, as well as straw.

Man missing in Saaremaa three days ago found
Treasure left his home in Kärla on Wednesday night in an unknown direction.
Treasure had the last contact by phone yesterday, Friday night, and the positioning of the phone gave the man the location of the Western Isles municipality, the village of Manchester, where he was searched by helicopter until midnight and with dogs until early morning.
His phone then ran out of battery and the man's whereabouts could therefore no longer be determined.
The police continued their search this morning.
Police thank everyone who contributed to the discovery of Treasure.
GMB worries about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The trade union expects the managers of cookie maker McVitie's to confirm long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of the Tollcross site investment.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, said they had invested more than £5million in the site over the past few years.
It hired more workers and union chairmen "will be the first to hear" if anything changes in factory activity.
In a letter to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "dissect concerns that the funding will not be used to modernise production lines."
Gmb senior managing director Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we are not getting clarity from the general manager of the site about Tollcross' business needs and future investment plan is deeply worrying for our members.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow, being an indispensable pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
So the east of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving company in McVitie's in terms of jobs, wages and welfare, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic decline in production."
A Pladis spokesman said: "Tollcross's site manager only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to it as we value active communication with workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting took place in Tollcross between employees and gmb representatives, where a number of issues were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our companies and sites - in order to ensure that we are competitive.
He added: "In recent years we have invested more than £5million in the Tollcross site, most of it has gone into production lines and operations improvements.
We fully understand Tollcross' legacy as a production site, and should there be any change in the operation of the site, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona against approaching Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on trying to lure Neymar into their ranks by making a £189million bid to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record-breaking conquest?
This tabloid approach has opened the summer transfer window and the Ligue 1 club are ready to break the current world record of more than double the buy-to-let record set last season by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for £89million.
Once the transfer is complete, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional athlete in the world to receive a salary of more than £500,000 a week from PSG after tax.
Barcelona are reportedly angry at both the approach and the break-up of Neymar, although a source close to the Catalans board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser al-Khelaifi harshly warned all clubs thinking about recruiting some of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch any of our players, we'll confront them and contact those players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign a contract with one of our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line since the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could backfire as a result of that interest by losing one of their expensive assets in neymar form.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit.
"Brexit threatens to drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders," he stressed.
Varadkar said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, if it could not, remain part of the European single market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to streamline Britain's departure would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish Prime Minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "Surely we could have one with Britain."
An alternative to this would be a return to customs posts, which would herald historical division and political failure.
"A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace," the Irish Prime Minister said.
He called Brexit a "challenge for our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily lives.
The Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of northern Ireland's main parties during a visit to Belfast.
Märt Avandi, who completed his first half-length triathlon: Ironman can be passed by anyone.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held in the winter capital Otepää, when about a thousand triathletes from more than thirty countries entered the half-length Ironman competition.
The distance of 70.3 miles consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avandi triumphantly completed the first triathlon of his life.
"I thought it was going to be difficult, and in the end it was difficult," Avandi said at the finish.
Despite the complexity, Avandi acknowledged that, in fact, triathlon is affordable for almost everyone.
"It's not the distance that kills, it kills the pace," he said, implying that at an affordable pace, almost everyone will reach the finish line.
With the exception of Ott Sepp: "Oti's physique is fine, but unfortunately he can't swim."
Avandi had been working out vigorously since February.
First 4-5 hours a week, and later ten hours a week.
In 05:34:12, he achieved 270th place overall.
Although Avandi lost to both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he beat other contestants in the so-called "prominent class".
Tanel Padar, who was a "good role model" last year, lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18, respectively).
German Johannes Moldan was crowned the overall winner of the men's count of the Otepää stage in the Ironman series in 3:58:27, while the best of the Estonians was Ivo The Great in 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Dane Helle Frederiksen triumphed in 04:24:01, while the Estonians defeated Maria Rabbit, who lost to Frederiksen in nearly half an hour and got 04:58:58.
Avandi completed a 1.9 km swim distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
Out of the water, he came in 410th position.
